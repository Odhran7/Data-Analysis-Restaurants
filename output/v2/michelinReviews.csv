HISA FRANKO,50,Sensational? Spectacular? Epic? Artful? Uber-Creative?,"Where do you begin when everything is so appetizing, well put together, tantalizing, unexpected, and flavorsome? When more than your sense of taste, is involved and you get a balanced experience between sight, touch, smell, and feel. An incredible dance for the palate.    First, they start with a heavy white bowl filled with wonderful, freshly picked, damp forest moss and ask you to feel it and smell it as a connection back to nature, a grounding to the present, which is what their menu represents. A bond, an association with the richness of nature’s many tastes, textures, colors, smells, and more. A connection to the local area, to now.    From the Fifty Shades of Life menu, a wink to Ana Roš and Hiša Franko Restaurant turning 50! Hoping for many more based on my experience here.  In awe of each dish (there were 18 of them – including the one you bring home), I kept wondering where such unfathomable creativity comes from. What kind of genius dreams-up stuff like that? Fig leaf granita mixed with puffed buckwheat? Beeswax fondue? Shiso leaf with mescal infused melon? Fig leaf kombucha tea.    The staff flowed through the tables, the outside patio, and all the rooms effortlessly and seamlessly. Whatever they promised, they never forgot to do. For example, they knew where I came from and one of their chef comes from the same part of Canada so at the end of the meal (at which point I had forgotten they would connect us) we met and it turns out he came from a mere 20km from where I do. Small world. Staff seems to be from many places, our server was from Colorado, USA, that chef from Québec, Canada, and many more.    There was no stuffy orchestration even though the coordination was flawless.    Even if you can’t or don’t want to drink alcohol, they have wonderful selections. I tried two of their Kombucha teas and both were marvelous, especially the fig leaf one (excellent and super refreshing, almost like a palate cleanser between courses).    It’s definitely not only about the presentation, the food, and the ambiance. What I also appreciated was just how connected the staff were with one another. Also their obvious love of the food. No matter how obscure a question was, they had an answer. I didn’t, for example, know what a lacto-fermented tomato water was (PS. It has nothing to do with milk). Once it was described to me, it helped me better understand the food I was served. So it is not only a tasting experience, but also a learning one.    I had a bit of a fear of coming to my first Michelin restaurant because I thought it would be a stodgy, pretentious place. As it turned out, everyone was very approachable, candid, polite, inquisitive, and fun, all the while attentive and professional. I could go on, but I’ll let you go and enjoy a meal there. I felt alive when I finished my meal despite the full stomach and the late hour. The portions and pace of each serving were perfect so I never felt overloaded. I would say, only one course wasn’t as good as all the others (too salty), the rest were all excellent and surprising.    Kudos to this amazing team who pulls this miracle night after night. Thank you for the great experience.    When checking out, you receive a menu signed by Ana herself accompanied by a specially made candy to take home. I am glad that my first Michelin experience was here. It will be hard to surpass.    OF NOTE: You cannot add a tip to your credit card bill so bring some cash if you want to tip."

HISA FRANKO,50,The ultimate dining experience,"Dining at Hisa Franko (chef Ana Ros) was the ultimate experience, as we had hoped. From arrival service to start of meal - and all 18 servings - just perfect. Some of the servings were perhaps a little too big - we had problems in eating it all.... - and very friendly and competent serving staff. To have such a place in the Slovenian Alps is pure magic."

HISA FRANKO,50,Top restaurant in rural Slovenia - I understand the 32rd place on the TOP 50 list.,"One of the best I've ever been. Some new flavors but that is one of the reasons to go to Hisa Franko.  Staff is very friendly, even Ana is on ""speaking"" terms with the guest (and yes even outside of the restaurant).  If you are in the neighborhood, don't hesitate! (although I don't think you can just pop-in :-))"

HISA FRANKO,50,Pure perfection,"WOW! What an incredible experience. Chef Ana Roš mixes local ingredients with haute cuisine, dishes look like paintings in Louvre. We’re blown away by the variety of flavors and techniques. Pure perfection. With professional service our evening was unforgettable."

HISA FRANKO,50,ONE OF A KIND EXPERIENCE,"I am not sure, where to start. Having a reservation for about 9 months, it was too long of a wait :) but worth it. We have booked the dine and stay option and I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting Hisa (the breakfast is totally worth it :D )  Upon arrival, we were welcomed by Svetlana, shown to our room and went for a late lunch. Tilen recommended a fantastic local bubbly, and it went together just excellently with the local cheeses on offer.  The setting of Hisa is unique, so we basked in a summer sun, sipped on the bubbles in the blooming garden and chilled.  Dinner:  17 courses, spanning across 3-4 hours, plus an option for a cheese board, go for it.  Fantastic selection of wines at very reasonable prices.  Having a really bad experience from a 1star restaurant in Berlin recently, our worries faded away immediately after the opener and we just felt great, going on a culinary journey on and on.  Is 17 dishes little or too much? Just right I would say, in Hisa´s case.  Staff: WONDERFUL.  We had so much fun, as Maria, being from US, suddenly spoke to us in Czech the evening took a different spin, it was great.  The sommelier, young lady, was spot on. We did not opt for the wine pairing, but went instead for a superb 2008 blanc de blancs grand cru, couple glasses of wonderful reds and finished it off with an amazing Tokai.    This was an experience worth waiting for and if we ever have a chance to visit again, we won´t hesitate.  Greatest thanks to Tilen, Svetlana, Maria and rest of the staff.  You are guys doing a fantastic job and you can be proud of it.  Hope to see you soon again."

HISA FRANKO,50,Worth the treacherous journey via gravel roads from LJB.,"Husband and I booked the dinner and room many months ago, and were so happy we did so! This was our first Michelan star restaurant so we weren’t sure what to expect. The service was amazing. The food even better. And the breathtaking views—perfection. Make this a stop when you visit the most beautiful country of Slovenia."

HISA FRANKO,50,One from the bucket list,"It is a pre-set menu with 18 bites. Also it is a predomenenant fusion of local ingredients with Asian preparation tehniques, athough few courses are traditional Slovenian.  Overall you will get fantastic coulinary experience way to complicated to explain but somehow it is working in perfect harmony  Crew is multinational and they have very relax approach to the customer during service which does not means that they are not professional.  17 people working in kitchen and 5 waiters will hold the room  Food will cost you 255€ per person without drinks.  I am all for this and I will visit again when they change menu. Alane thank you for your service it was perfect"

HISA FRANKO,10,AVOID!...got sick!,"I stopped in at Hisa Franko for lunch on June 1 2023 to enjoy what I expected to be another spectacular meal at a Michelin star restaurant. Unfortunately the meal… maybe it was the mussel or maybe it was the timothy hay crusted potato or something else, …gave me food poisoning and made me violently ill for the following 24 hours. Not a pleasant experience on your vacation! There was no other possible source than the meal at Hisa Franko. It was not a flu virus. To add insult to injury when I indicated to Hisa Franko what had happened they were not apologetic nor would they refund the cost of my meal. While I understand that mistakes can happen I cannot understand their staunch denial that I could get sick from their meal. As I said before, there was no other possible source. Perhaps they need to understand that the customer’s experience is not all about the story of the preparation of the food but also how the customer feels once they leave the restaurant. I had much more pleasant experiences eating other Slovenian food elsewhere."

HISA FRANKO,40,Mountain Summit Rally stop,"Wonderful location, Mountain View’s. Very friendly staff, dining experience was up there with the best.. rooms are very comfortable, internet struggled, but that that time to absorb the surroundings."

HISA FRANKO,40,Two Michelin starred venue in the outskirts of Kobarid,"Hisa Franco is well know due to its' two Michelin starred restaurant. It features limited number of hotel rooms. The rooms are nicely & homely decorated offering the basics for overnight stay, but sadly no air conditioning what you would expect in this level locations.    The two stars are setting expectation level to the top. The check in was very smooth and professional. We were invited for aperetifs before dinner, but this turned out that we were to order drinks from their menu. The set up outdoors was though very nice.    The restaurant venue is classy and stylish. The service was overwhelming. The food (tasting menu) was extensive and very nicely presented. Sadly the tastes were often a bit mild and basically all food was eaten with your fingers. The wine package of local wines was just ok, nothing really special.    Chef Ana Ros visited the tables many time what was really nice.    Breakfast was as a whole a nice experience. Just surprising that you are expected to pay extras for your coffees and teas.    All in all, a nice experience but sadly did not meet our expectations."

HISA FRANKO,40,Very Creative Menu,"I felt a little Alice in Wonderful going down the garden path, never knowing what little dish was going to come next. So creative, and beautiful presentation.    The Lacto Fermented tomato water, elderberry, elderberry and tarragon  Pastrami beef tongue, jalapeño and crystal algae  Was that it was so shocking flavorful, I needed another one to really taste it. It was wonderful.    The only disappointment was a dish I was thinking could have been a highlight.  Potato baked in August hay crust, cultured butter with lovage and horseradish.  The potato was only mildly warm, and the butter was very cold as to not melt on the potato, so not capturing the whole favor of the dish. Something that both should have been warmer,    The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, wines were very good.    Having worked in the past in the food service industry, I found it is nice to be recognized by upper management. With only 7 tables it shouldn't have been hard to either say hi or ask about the meal. While both manager and chef were out on the floor, this did not happen. But I guess when you got these Michelain stars, maybe they feel its not needed."

HISA FRANKO,50,Looking for journey? Go to Hisa Franko,"It's hard to pick the word that would express all my feelings that I felt during the dinner; but if I have to choose I would go with perfection. From the moment of our arrival, to aperitif (Mountain sour=TOP), dinning experience which each plate is taking you somewhere else but you are constantly in Slovenia with carefully picked ingredients. We were entertained by amazing young waiters, we went with funky pairing which was more than just amazing. During the night we got company by chef's from the kitchen and that made our stay at Hisa Franko just perfect. Thank you for this amazing experience and hopefully will be back soon."

HISA FRANKO,20,Don’t buy the hype,"Underwhelming in virtually every regard. We visited last month.    Setting: the region where the restaurant sits undeniably beautiful. Yet I couldn’t help but feel like they did not make the most of it. The “garden” where patrons had pre and post-dinner drinks was littered with cheap-looking plastic chairs overlooking what was essentially an unmanicured field of grass.    Service: the most disappointing aspect of the night. We were invited to the garden for a pre dinner drink and ordered a beer and cocktail. 10 minutes later, a waiter comes with a beer, but the wrong one. Then while waiting on the beer, another waiter comes to us and hands us menus (as though we hadn’t been helped yet). Minutes later, my beer comes and they ask if we want anything else (uh, yes, perhaps the cocktail we ordered?). Three whiffs in 15 minutes! The service during the meal itself was generally better, but it’s hard to overlook such missteps at a restaurant of this caliber and price point.    Wine pairing: enjoyed the local wines, even if not to my liking and style preference. They did forget to pour our dessert wine and rushed over halfway through the dish to pour (and essentially skipped the explanation).    Food: I appreciate what they are trying to do. For me, it didn’t work. Even the dishes I enjoyed were puzzling. The lamb / mole taco - tasty bite, but the essence of lamb was entirely obfuscated by the herb sauce and mole, and there wasn’t anything in the flavor profile of the dish (mole tasted of typical Mexican mole) that helped me understand Slovenian cuisine. The carrot kebob - had a really hard time understanding what the goal was, as it was a chewy strand of carrot caked in spices… does it matter that it’s local if it’s hardly edible?    Hotel: we stayed the night at the hotel. It is reasonably priced, so it’s hard to complain much, but again - for this caliber of destination restaurant, they should dedicate more resources to the hotel facilities. It is an afterthought at best.    Lastly, I find it odd that Ana responds personally to so many of the reviews on here, and with such an air of defensiveness (and often referring to herself in the third person). People travel from other continents to visit your establishment, they have a right to voice their concerns."

HISA FRANKO,50,Fantastic experience,"My wife and me booked a dinner at Ana Ris‘ Hisa Franko. First of all the welcome was fantastic, young enthusiastic people from all over the world, beautiful views and a wonderful Apéro. The dinner was outstanding. But to explain more I would open some miracles and I don‘t want this for all upcoming guests. At the end Ana welcomed the guests with a short sympathic chat. Great restaurant!"

HISA FRANKO,50,Our high expectations were exceeded!!!,"The entire experience was outstanding!!! It is rarely, when you have a tasting menu with so many dishes that almost ALL of them are absolutely delicious, but that was the case here. There was only one dish that was not outstanding, while still being good. Every single dish was a piece of art. Simply incredible!!"

HISA FRANKO,50,We came with high expectations and we were not disappointed,"The food was really surprisingly good and we came with high expectations! So when that happens, you kinda get the value you were hoping you came for. Some plates stood out more than the others (for me, see below) but one could not say there were any disappointments, and I believe I'm commenting for our whole group.    Some were expecting a more traditional approach with desserts for instance, but we all knew where we were going and what to expect, so hardly a surprise in any bad sense. That said, the desserts were punchy ( fruity acidity was present), balanced (with sweetness), full of character and blended in the whole menu perfectly.    Plates that really stood out tho, for me personally:  - tacos (or tortilla as per their menu),  - Chawanmushi and  - Where's the meat?    We went for the ""funky"" wine pairing and we were quite happy with our choice. Some of us wanted to have a different pairing but their policy is for the whole table to go with one only -- which we completely understand but if we're nitpicking, this might be one of the very few quibbles.    A couple of wines we also wished that were opened a bit earlier (to let them open up sooner) but perhaps next time we'll let them know about our choosing in advance.    Lastly we wished ourselves were a bit more diligent with letting the otherwise super friendly and kind staff know about slowing down the upbeat tempo - it was quite paced for us. We take this responsibility on us - they let us know from the very start to be vocal about it but we kinda forgot and it wasn't anything bad per se, just something we should be more aware about it next time.    Also if you're planning to go there in a group with smokers (or not), go there earlier (19.00 instead of 20.00) and enjoy it in a more paced tempo.    That said, thank you hiša Franko, you're a great team that works hard and it shows A LOT! We will come again, for sure!"

HISA FRANKO,50,Art and Taste,"We were two couples. Our common view was that this restaurant is for guys who like art. We’ve been in at least 15 Michelin restaurants and the kitchen of Ana Roš was the very best from the artistic and taste points of view. As far as the aroma was concerned we felt wood, moss, and mushrooms with very special but still very tasty bites. The artistic finish with excellent desserts was a special peak of the day.  The wine was excellent, only I was slightly dissapponted with Bourgogne and especially thrilled with Madeira."

HISA FRANKO,50,Mastering the Art of Fine Dining,"We were transplanted to another universe throughout the entire evening. From the moment we walked into Hiša Franko through its warm and welcoming entryway we knew we will be in for a treat. I ordered dirty martini as my aperitif, and their interpretation of the cocktail was playful and delicious. I sensed thyme and other herbs, and loved every sip of it!    We added wine pairing to our dinner, and did not regret the choice. Sommelier was knowledgeable and wine pairings were really complimentary of the dishes. All servers spoke excellent English, and Tilen & Anja were our favorite as they singlehandedly brought so much joy to our table with every serving.    And then, the food. What is there to say that has not been said yet? We loved every dish, and we were amused with elaborate hand washing that occurred at the table. We were transported via our taste buds to places throughout the world, but also to different corners of Slovenia. My mouth is watering just writing this review!    Lastly - Chef Ana Roš. She is a cherry on the top. If you’re fortunate enough to catch her in the restaurant, bow to her. She is so creative, exceptionally talented, and still very approachable, kind, and generous with her time. We really cherished the drink we exchanged with Chef Ana, and it made our entire experience so special. Thank you!    Slovenia has many natural wonders, and I’d like to recommend yoy add Hiša Franko to that list. It is worth the scenic drive, and I recommend spending the night with them. We will be back!"

HISA FRANKO,50,Dinner for the ages,"Dining like this is like seeing the NYC ballet or touring the Musee d’Orsay, a culinary artistic experience that stays with you well after the dinner. Every bite an explosion of flavor. “I’ve never tasted that before” kept coming up. Textures, visual beauty, clear craftsmanship with each dish. The best part for me was chef Ros coming to the table to describe a dish and genuinely hoping, but not necessarily sure, that we’d enjoy it. We loved every second of every bite. Oh, and the service was impeccable."

HISA FRANKO,50,Perfect,A wish came true. I Always wanted to go to Hisa Franko and it was even better than expected. Maybe the room wasn't 10/10 but everything else was.

HISA FRANKO,50,A highly recommended experience,"A terrific culinary experience in a lovely relaxed setting. The meal was a production of many acts, prepared with great care and much love. Truly memorable."

HISA FRANKO,40,Author's Cuisine,"A destination meal by definition thanks to its location in the Slovenian mountains Hiša Franko sees Chef Ana Roš cooking an author's cuisine as she tells the story of her homeland through entirely local Ingredients interpreted with global perspective.    Not just a Restaurant but an Inn and Roš’ home, the onetime farmhouse and WWI hospital officially serving Food since 1973, it is upon arrival that guests will notice personal touches including photos and knickknacks extending from the Wine store to rooms upstairs.    Entirely self-taught, Ana’s background in international sciences set aside so that she and husband Valter could pursue a dream and raise their children in stunning Soča Valley, Spring 2022 features a menu titled “Reincarnation” as the World seeks a new beginning in the post-vaccine era.    Self-described as unorthodox, a lack of international Stage or formal training seeing Chef Roš develop a style all her own, Dinner at Hiša Franko unfolds across 22 courses or bites served in naturally-inspired environs, the opening duo of White Asparagus with Truffles and Beef Tongue Pastrami on a “Seaweed Crystal” with Jalapeno attesting to Slovenia’s geographic diversity.    Telling stories across three hours, professional and educated staff frequently joined by Roš and her cat or dog in the dining room, course two is described as “Impression of Charcuterie” and moves fluidly from a Liver Bonbon to grilled early Carrots and an unctuous Potato Tart brightened by Anchovies.    Modernist despite the lush green surroundings at times, a Cornmeal Beignet stuffed with Trout Roe reminiscent of that at Disfrutar, its follow-up of a simple Potato baked in Hay gets right back to basics while Fava Bean Custard with Mussels and Squid to follow sees Slovenia’s Mediterranean border explored.    All small-portions with suggested Wines almost entirely Slovenian the middle of Hiša Franko’s menu resides entirely in Soča Valley, locally caught Trout in two forms followed by a single Ravioli feauring Fruit and Pork before looking global with a Taco utilizing Lamb from Drežnica and Corn from the Mountains.    Opting for Kombucha to freshen the palate, Herbs from the garden slightly sweetened, Roš’ Green Pea Wonton arrives aggressively flavored with earth while her take on African Injera utilizes off-cuts to create a deep and complex Broth poured inside an Onion.    Indistinct when transitioning savory to sweet as both Potato-Nettle Gnocchi and Cheese Water Mochi blurred that line, Desserts began with a cooked Pear beneath Hay Ice Cream before delivering a sour “Wrap” akin to Fruit Leather and finishing with Mignardises including Tempeh made without Soy but instead Cocoa Nibs."

HISA FRANKO,50,The best in many years,"Blown away. A almost 20 courses diner, paring natural wines of top wineries, perfect! Even the owner Ana Ros past by two times to ask if every thing was ok. Thanks a lot Hisa Franko!"

HISA FRANKO,50,WHAW - What an experience!!,"We discovered Hisa Franko via the Netflix series 'Chef's Table"" and their ""Top-50 restaurants of the world"" classification. We went for lunch as there were no rooms available anymore but the lunch menu was the same as the dinner menu. We had our 6-year old with us but luckily we got a babysit via Hisa Franko who kept our boy more than busy around the restaurant (with some food and ice cream) so we got fully enjoy the experience. Although it was a really hot day, they kept the temperature of the room doable in a natural way (by creating a breeze).  We were welcomed by a team of very professional and international waiters. They started with warning us that there were a lot of perfectly timed courses, so if we wanted to go to the toilet or quickly check with our boy, we had to warn them 15 minutes before.  Now to the food... This was simply spectacular. Every course was fine dining and perfectly balanced. The courses indeed followed each other quickly, but we never had the feeling it was too fast. The wines were good and fitting but I will not remember Hisa Franko for the wine experience. It was the food and the vast number of spectacular courses that really jumped out!  After the full menu, we enjoyed an extra plate of home-made cheese (same cheese but different ages) on the terrace! Highly recommended!  The only comment is that we wanted to bring the paper menu home but they said it was not needed as we would get a present at checkout but after the cheese, we forgot to ask and they also forgot to give it. But well, if that's the only negative comment I can find..."

HISA FRANKO,50,A REINCARNATION BEYOND THE ESSENTIALS!,"A REINCARNATION BEYOND THE ESSENTIALS!    Ana's project ""Reincarnation"" has a multitude of aromas and smells around the world. It's seductive.    A truly unforgettable evening. The breathtaking dinner is rounded off by Valter's wine and the well-rehearsed and friendly Hiša Franko team.    A visit to Ana and Valter in Kobarid, near the Julian Alps, is always recommended, enjoy a very special evening."

HISA FRANKO,50,Pure art!,"It is so much more than just fine dining, it is pure art like going to some world class theater seeing great piece of ballet. If you prepare yourself right beforehand you get to know a lot more than just food. Excellent."

HISA FRANKO,50,Hisa,"A Culinary Symphony by Ana Roš - when every plate of food becomes a work of art and when cooking becomes an art. A wonderful experience that combines a symphony of flavors, masterfully prepared dishes, premium biodynamic Slovenian wines and a warm atmosphere at Hiša Franko. A wonderful team of (mostly young) people from Hiša Franko make sure that every plate and glass of wine is served with heart and a wonderful story. An experience you will not forget."

HISA FRANKO,40,Interesting menu and dinner,"A little restoran quite deep in slovenia in a very beatiful soca valley close by italy. Very nicely decorated with a open fireplace so cozy and private but still with a few tables around but far enough away. We had the fully monty you can say menu with the funky pairing which came out per person 225 +120 euro per person. The recarnation menu is with 24 bites and even if it sounds like a lot is ok and they do it with amazing speed so that we managed it in just over 3 hours. Staff is good from all around the world and know what to say and explain. Not sure what to say about food, realy nice prepared, tasty, good all made mainly to eat as fingerfood. Many things i tasted for the first time overall tasty perhaps a bit too saltly, but had it all and was good. The funky pairing was more hard, starts well but then moves to some odd homemade cocktails of two i found just plain undrinkable but there are some good wines and quite enough of drinks. So yes try it if you can afford and enjoy i would not come again but would not be happy if i did not taste it."

HISA FRANKO,50,"Fantastic meal, wines and service!","My husband and I had a wonderful dining experience at Hisa Franko this past September. Each course was a taste explosion in your mouth. The combination of ingredients and the presentation of every tasting was brilliant. We especially loved how each dish was explained and that all ingredients were locally sourced. I hope I will be able to return to Slovenia in the future and eat here again. Worth it! Thank you, Ana, and team. Keep up the awesome creativity!"

HISA FRANKO,30,Reincarnation menu experience - not worth the cost,"We read several great reviews about Hiša Franko and we decided to visit it and taste the menu. At the moment they have a Reincarnation menu.    Maybe we had high expectations, at the end of our experience we had only a high bill and bitter taste. Ok, this is not the point, we've decided to have experience at a 2 star Michelin restaurant and we are more or less familiar with the prices. We didn't like the combinations from the menu. At the meat part of courses which we didn't like the most they serve roasted lamb, bear paw, lamb, chicken, pork offcuts stock. Everything is too strong in the taste, they mixed too many ingredients and it is difficult to recognize the essence of food and ingredients itself.    We do not have allergy at any kind of food, but I felt a little bit sick after mix of all menu courses. In the dessert part of the menu there was ice cream twice, completely unnecessarily. The best part of the menu was bread & butter and Tolmin cheese mochi. The rest of the menu we wouldn't taste again.    The service was good, nothing spectacular. Chef didn't show up, what is a bit disappointing for this level of a restaurant.    Our choice was not to pair the wine with the menu because it was lunch time and we needed to drive, so we decided to drink one glass of white and I also choose one glass of red wine. The selection of Slovenian wine is very poor, and when I decided that I'll drink a glass of red wine, mostly with the meat part of the menu, the waiter pour me the last part from the bottle with the last drops with all sediment in the bottle, absolutely unacceptable.    I think that Hiša Franko has still lot to learn and grow up. Maybe they prepare and present food on a really spectacular way, but they are a little bit pretentious and to pricy for the offer. At the end we had a bitter taste because of all food combination and wine, I'll be polite, and I'll say I had a bitter taste also because of strange, instead of bad Negroni taste as an aperitive. Negroni it should be Negroni wherever you serve it.    Definitely, yes, it was a new experience. But given the distance we traveled to visit, we really did not feel good enough. We expected much more and we were disappointed. May you have better luck!"

HISA FRANKO,30,"Excellent Food, Odd Service and Ambiance","I am glad we went to this place. The food was amazing. Full stop. Perhaps the best I have ever had. But I found the atmosphere to be pretentious and, similar to the review below, I found the service is more more about them than about the diner. Unlike JMK, below, we were not asked to register our desire to go to the bathroom for fear of tripping up the flow, but we had a similar experience with regard to the wine service. Firstly, the wines are quite reasonably priced; most are local and affordable, but there is little outside this strike zone. Cellar is not deep or wide IMO and very few older vintages. We ordered a Vipava Zelen for white and a Goriska Brda Rebula - the Rebula being recommended by the Sommelier. These were ordered before the service began, but were both at room temperature. The som offered to ""quick chill"" the white, so we were confused to be sitting for more than 10 minutes after the food service began with no wine of any sort. When asked why were waiting to eat, we said - ""because we have no wine"". The still-warm wine was being kept off-table so after a few cycles of waiting with empty glass - waiting on a refill - I suggested - then specifically requested - that the white be put in an ice bucket and set on the table so I could be certain it was being chilled and could fill my own glass. The hostess advised that this was not something they do and I would have to content myself with the service as it was. Not sure if buckets on tables is a ""bad look"" for them or what reason they might have for refusing such a simple request. I found this to be arrogant and the opposite of hospitable. Bells being rung before servings (!?!) and similar new-age hubris accompanied by dish descriptions in an English that I simply could not understand only added to the discontent. In general I prefer a more relaxed atmosphere such as at La Subida in the Collio. Perhaps La Subida's funky style is more to my personal liking than Hisa Franko's, so to each his own. Food is another level here, but the service and atmosphere are not for me. Not an issue of cost. So a mixed experience. Glad we went. Would not return."

HISA FRANKO,40,Mixed Results but Excellent Food,"My wife and I had dinner here with wine pairings. The food was top-notch and exactly what I expected for a restaurant with 2 Michelin stars. It was innovative, relied heavily on local ingredients and was delicious. We had about 25 dishes and the vast majority were outstanding. The pacing of the meal was very good at the beginning and end but was too slow during the middle portion devoted to main dishes.    I found the wine parings to be underwhelming, partly due to my own personal preferences. The wines generally matched the food well but included two orange wines and a moscato and I don’t like either style. One of the pairings was an apple cider which I also don’ like and don’t think should be passed off as a wine.    The main reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 ,though, pertains to an odd service issue. At the beginning of the dinner they asked us to give them notice if we needed to the bathroom or take a cigarette break so as to not disrupt the flow of the dinner. I found the request a little unusual but fairly reasonable. About half way through dinner I had to go to the bathroom. I mentioned this to a waiter and he said the next course (dumplings) would be out in 1 minute. After 5-6 minutes of waiting I gave up on the dumpling and headed for the bathroom. The room manager cut me off and tried to stop me from going to the bathroom. I found this very unprofessional and reminded him that I was paying a lot of money for dinner and would go o the bathroom when I pleased, plus I had been told the dumpling course would arrive 5 minutes earlier. I have eaten at a number of Michelin starred restaurants and never encountered anything so odd and unprofessional."

HISA FRANKO,40,Sensational,"The food is truly exceptional. Ana’s creativity is unique. The tastes and textures are all original and a delight for the palate. Joel, the Catalan sommelier, is not only a highly qualified wine expert but more importantly a very convivial host.    The reason I give four stars is the fact that the website promises a bit more than what you’re supposed to get: though we were lunch guests we were not offered the cheese tour nor the pasture jungle walking tour and a €25 price increase between booking time and arrival."

HISA FRANKO,50,Fantastic experience,"Fantastic experience, one of a kind. A very warm welcome, attention to detail, an orchestrated movement of all staff to make one feel welcome, important and overall informed about each step of the menu. Adored most of the dishes of the reincarnation menu only two were too strong for my palate. Stayed in the hotel rooms there. The night was quiet and the breakfast the morning after was a again a pleasure for the eyes and palate. Bravo!"

HISA FRANKO,50,Polar star,I was in This restaurant and I Would like to congratulation all staff for the “amazing” experience. They have fantastic cullinary story . All the plates were incredibile. I reccomend to try This restaurant because is simple the Best. Tomaz Milic

HISA FRANKO,50,Amazing experience,"Had an amazing night here in Juli of 2021. Menu Reincarnation was just great, with a good mix between new influences and local products. We had the local wine pairing: all Slovenian wines were surprising and brought the dishes to an even higher level. Service during the evening was impeccable and Ana came around several times to have a quick chat. You can really feel the passion Ana and the team have for the local products & farmers, which made the experience even more authentic for us.    We also stayed overnight and while the room was maybe a bit outdated, it was clean and spacious (with an amazing bathroom). Breakfast in the morning was good as well. The Slovenian breakfast (including coffee, fresh fruit, granola cookies, yogurt, fresh jams & bread) is included in the price of the rooms, while other options are charged extra. You could ask yourself if it is fair to charge another €14 for some cheese in an already very expensive experience (the room charge was already €165), but in the end it did not really bother us that much.    As a conclusion: we had a great night here and would recommend everyone to stay 1 night as Hisa Franko when in the neighborhood"

HISA FRANKO,30,a cold disapointment,"The setting was nice. Well-designed, with an open fireplace in the dining room, adding to well feeling. The reception was professional and courteous as one would expect for a Michelin 2-star restaurant. The rest of the service was equally effective, but had several flaws. The first was the waiter welcoming us and asking whether we are fine to have part of the service (it was most of it) in English. We don't have problems with English and agreed, but half of our dining room were patrons from Slovenia, so perhaps Slovenian/Italian/German/Hungarian service is not the best solution. I understand that kitchens in high-end restaurants are international; the same could go for well-experienced waiting staff and sommeliers. The young team that was there to bring the plates to the tables and explain them, could very well be local. Isn't all at Hiša Franko about being local?  The next part of the service hinted of another thing that disappointed us at Franko - a feeling that you are there because of them and not vice versa as it should be. The waiter asked us if it is our first time visiting Franko. I started to explain that it wasn't, describing the first visit at the very start of chef Ana's working there. While I was talking, I realised that the waiter is not listening to me at all; instead, he was checking the dining room and whether the service is progressing according to the plan at all the tables. Yes, the service was highly efficient and without major technical faults, but it lacked a personal touch throughout the dinner.  Next, the chef and sous-chef came to greet us. They stopped at each table, welcomed the guests, explained the concept behind the menu (it was ""we can't travel this year, so we brought the world to your plates"") and wished us a pleasant evening. It was a nice, yet unusual touch. Unusual because the chef didn't return at the end of the meal. I find it much more common for someone (great if that is the chef) asks whether you enjoyed - after the meal. That was not the case at Franko, another hint that there cannot be any doubt in what they are doing.  Then came the sommelier. We opted for the wine pairing (the ""low"" priced one at 80 EUR per person), but explained the sommelier that we absolutely don't like orange wines. Knowing that they are fond of them at Franko, we asked for a pairing without. My understanding of a sommelier is that he/she should be able to find a good pairing to the dishes served. Perhaps not an optimal one if there are constraints (as were in our case), but still something that would fit the dishes, wine cellar, and guest's preferences. Instead, she explained that they found the optimal pairing (another ""we know it best moment"") and wouldn't change it (another ""you are here because of us"" moment). We accepted her excellent suggestion to give us a taste of each wine before serving and then change it if we don't like it. The suggestion was a very good one, it just didn't happen at any of the wines. In addition to that, it turned out that only one of the wines served was orange. She should told us that in the very beginning and avoid any problem whatsoever.  The sommelier also offered us to start with a glass of champagne. We agreed, however, less than two minutes after she served it, the uber-efficient service put the first dish in front of us, accompanied by another glass of sparkling wine. Having had a single sip of the starting (off-the-wine-pairing) one, it was certainly not a good move (by the way, we came a bit early and not late, therefore this couldn't be the case of the rushed service).  There is only one menu. It was 13 courses, so we didn't miss the non-existing amuse bouche(s) and petit fours because of being hungry but because it is kind of a standard at restaurants such as Franko.  It was my understanding that Franko is all about local environment, supporting the farmers and traditions of the Soča valley, incorporating local ingredients and reviving almost forgotten dishes. The menu certainly didn't reflect that. Yes, the theme of the dinner was bringing the world to our table and the speriphied tzatziki made of local yoghurt combined the world and Kobarid, but the waiter bragging that they are making their tortilla from original Mexican corn that is sourced in Mexico through sous-chefs connections there, and then flown in by airplane (I heard chef Ana complaining about the globalization in an interview shortly after our dinner) was definitely within the concept.  There was another big attitude problem with the service. On several occasions, waiters (you don't have ""your"" waiter throughout the dinner), they would ask as questions such as ""Do you know what is tzatziki? (and mochi, mezcal, gazpacho)"". It felt like being on a gameshow quiz. What if I don't know the answer? Am I a culinary illiterate? And if I only answer partially correct? Will the waiter, in a condescending tone, correct me? I agree that the perhaps less-known culinary terms should be explained to the guest, but in a way that presumes that the guest knows the answer, through description how they localized a certain dish (e.g., by using the local farm-sourced yoghurt to make the tzatziki). We failed to learn what was the creative part of the Franko's mezcal...  The food at a 2* restaurant isn't bad. It cannot be simply because of all the time and effort invested, high quality of the ingredients, extensive team in the kitchen, and their culinary knowledge. It should, however, offer a ""wow"" effect in at least a few points during the meal. The dishes at Franko didn't do that for us. It is of course a highly subjective matter, but if I mention a dish that absolutely nailed it (the ""autumn forest soup"", a fantastic combination of flavors and textures) and a phenomenal bread to start the dinner, I can also say that the savory almond soup was overpowered by the bitter almond flavor and that I think that serving three slices of fruit (along with a - local? - Peruvian cherry) sprinkled with spiced salts is not worthy of a dessert dish in such a high-end restaurant.  How to conclude? Just as I was writing this, chef Ana was talking on a round table on Slovenian TV. She explained that they work toward all the guests being happy when they leave their restaurant. We dedicated a whole weekend to visit Franko and got there in a great mood. We left disappointed. Not because the (expected) hefty price tag (530 EUR for two). Not because the food was bad. We just weren't amazed by the food (as Ana said on the TV, perhaps the guests, who don't like their food, don't understand it; another ""we know best"" moment). But, above all, we were unhappy with the very well functioning ""machinery"" that seemed so uninterested in the guest. I see high-end restaurants like art - there is technique and there are emotions. Sorry to say, we missed the latter."

HISA FRANKO,50,Unforgettable,"No complaints. No negatives. No disappointments. Our evening at the restaurant, the red room, the menu, the corresponding wines, the knowledgeable staff and Mrs Ros herself - everything was at top level on August 15th.  Thanks for these memories!  And this bred, holly moly, this bred is the best we have ever eaten!"

HISA FRANKO,50,By far the best fine-dining experience of my life!,"Regardless if you arrive from the Italian side by following the Natisone river or from the Slovenian side, alongside the turquoise river Soča, both scenic drives lead to Staro selo, a small village in the middle of nowhere, underneath a green mystic mountain often wrapped with fluffy white clouds. It is not only the home to Hiša Franko, Slovenia’s first and only two Michelin star restaurant, but also to its mostly international staff, some of whom, relocated across the globe to work in this restaurant.    Unlike most stiff and dull fine dining experiences I’ve had so far, by entering Hiša Franko, you come into a very homey and relaxed atmosphere, it almost feels like you are sitting down at the personal dining table of Chef Ana Roš and Valter Kramar. The reception by the service staff was warm, but highly professional, which was later fully demonstrated during an impeccable dinner service.    The menu brings out the best of both worlds – rich Slovenian heritage and ingredients, for example, the world-famous Soča river trout is being used in multiple dishes, but in a completely sustainable way without a single part going to waste; paired with a global outlook attained from constant pre-pandemic globetrotting and multicultural backgrounds of the kitchen staff. A great example of these two worlds coming together in perfect harmony, is my favorite desert – Mochi, a dessert typically eaten during Lantern Festival towards the end of Chinese New Year’s celebrations, but with a local twist that includes Jamar pit cheese, indigenous pears and a roasted hazelnut coating. What a bite of pure happiness!    The menu is paired with incredible natural wines, predominately from different Slovenian wine regions, showcasing the richness of Slovenian terroir and its indigenous grape varieties, such as Zelen, Pinela, Rebula, etc.; however, one could also go with a flavorsome and playful non-alcoholic pairing, consisting of kombuchas and fermentations of local herbs, fruits and vegetables.    All in all, in my humble opinion, Hiša Franko is a captivating, magical world of multi-sensory pleasures across scents, colors, flavors and textures, that mustn’t be missed on your travels in Slovenia and/or Friuli Venezia Giulia.    Thank you for a truly unforgettable experience and I already look forward to my next visit!"

HISA FRANKO,50,"I’ve been in Hisa Franko twice,","I’ve been in Hisa Franko twice, the second time this year after 3 years. Wow!    What a step forward! Bravo Ana and the team! There is not a single thing that hasn’t become better in this time. The hospitality, the environment, the atmosphere, the new non alcoholic pairing and then the menu. Inspired by the Big world (which Ana is also saying it on the menu) but made with local ingredients, local flavor combinations and local ideas.    My favorite dish was the dessert, the mochi. This asian delight made Kobarid style using pit cheese Jamar, local pears and instead of sesame you can find roasted hazelnuts. Totally Slovenian, alpine flavours put together with a Japanese idea!    Thank you guys, keep on rockin’! I am looking forward to coming back"

HISA FRANKO,50,Just amazing!,"Me, my wife and a best friend went for a dinner in early October to Hisa Franko.  From the moment that we were seated and till the end of our evening, everything was way better than we expected.  We had 15 courses ( I think), and if you compare this menu, with the last years one, I can assure you that this one is a few levels higher! I just didn't like one plate and this is because I don't like the main ingredient on that dish, otherwise everything was perfect.  Personal is very polite, professional ,not intrusive from beginning till the end.  I can't comment the wine paring since we choose the wines from the wine list (which is mind blowing).  I don't really understand all the bad reviews from the other people but from my side this was a top sh*t dinner/evening.  We will definitely come back next year!"

HISA FRANKO,50,Awesome restaurante in Slovenia!,"Food is amazing! Totally disruptive and awesome! Great service and mood! 100% recommended!!! Moreover, the town is so beautiful!"

HISA FRANKO,30,I'm lost,"I was expecting a truly original Slovenian cuisine. Slovenia has so many good base ingredients, they have them all. Meat, mushrooms, herbs, whatever name it and you'll find it in Slovenia.    Why do you have to cook such complicate dishes which you will never be aw to recognise without a menu? Because otherwise you get no stars?    Is that so much better then seeing your clients at least twice? Because I bet nobody comes a second time. I won't.    Everything is nice and perfect but I have so enough of dishes with more than 3 ingredients on the plate. They make absolutely no sense    Rethink it please. Location is amazing, service and wine list is amazing. Why to destroy everything you have"

HISA FRANKO,30,What happened to Hisa Franko?,"After an amazing experience last December we decided to go back to Hisa Franko and after today’s experience I wonder what happened?    The service was so unpersonal, it all felt like an auto pilot, dishes rattled of like they memorized a poem, treating us like we never had been to a restaurant, wine poured like in a pub and dishes served to quickly. But that can be forgiven, but what happened with the menu? Where is the Slovenian and local heritage in Kiwi, too spicy gazpacho or Mexican style salted fruit? Yes there where still amazing dishes, but overall it seems like a chef who believes she needs to reinvent herself but believe me it’s better to stay with your roots as that is why I travel half over Europe in times of Corona and not to get a Mexican styled menu, I can find this at home as well.  And then charging me a wine at 140€ which is listed at 75€ in the hope I would just give my CC without checking my bill ( I must have come across as a stupid tourist) this was the drop that made me react. The sommelier came over and when I asked what wine I ordered she pointed out the regular Rubela at 75 and said it was a mistake from her side, but that is was no problem and she would adjust the bill. No problem, really? You try to have me pay 140€ for a 75€ and you find this “no problem”? Well, I do and made this clear.  Suddenly the Maitre D and chef where at my table trying to make things right but somehow they didn’t achieve, the Maitre D tried to explain I got the expensive wine ( which wasn’t the case as I know what I got and the sommelier confirmed this earlier) and I should be happy they only charged my the cheap one as the sommelier made a mistake.  And to add insult to injury when I wanted to settle my bill with an AmEx, he told me that due to Slovenian law he couldn’t accept AmEx, ending an highly anticipated evening in total disappointment.    Ana, in case you read this, please get back to where you where 2 years ago, get rid of the international service and chefs, focus again on what made you great and I’m happy to come back. However if you want to continu on this path, satisfying the food tourist that instagram their food and are happy to say they went to Hisa Franko just for the sake of it, then I’m sorry but then I will go somewhere else.    A truly disappointed fan."

HISA FRANKO,50,Fantastic cuisine especially with the local wines,"Chef Ana Ros’ restaurant went from zero to two Michelin stars and deservedly so. Her extraordinary cuisine feels international with the likes of tacos but it is all based on the superb ingredients of her terroir, the Soca valley.  The restaurant is elegant yet comfortable, caters also to families with children and does it with style. The service as expected is professional and also very international, your waiting staff will likely include locals, Lebanese, Mexicans, Hungarians etc.  And as the highlight is definitely on the great local produce, the menu pairs fantastically with the superb selection of Slovenian wines, hearty, strong whites and reds. Sommelier and co-owner Valter’s cellar may also be visited and there one can admire not just the wine selection but also his collection of aged cheeses. The additional cheese platter at the end of the meal is a perfect ending.  A meal at Hisa Franko is definitely not for the everydays as it is surely on the pricey side but experiencing her creative, self taught, fantastic cuisine is worth every penny."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,40,Very enjoyable Lunch,"Excellent service in a wonderful atmosphere with very good food is what we expected and Palais delivered on all accounts. The food is very good; however, not exquisite as you would expect from a three-star Michelin restaurant. The duck four ways had two very good applications and two that fell somewhat short, hence for the reduction of one star. Regardless of some of the courses falling a little short the overall meal was delightful."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,30,"The pancake is cold , not worth the money for flamed roast duck 4 way to eat,",我3 /28/23吃了個午餐 食物服務都不錯 環境非常優雅 讓我覺得不滿意的是 我定的是火焰鴨三吃 結果上的是四吃 同三吃不同的是加了鴨鬆生菜包 差價是1900 元 非常不值 鴨烤得很好 但餅是冷的 需要改進  Michael Lee

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Great Visit to Taipei,"Very nice uniquely designed hotel. It is a little dated/deferred maintenance in parts, but overall, a nice luxury hotel in Taipei. The restaurant is absolutely amazing! The service and flavors are very worthy of its Michelin 3-stars! Highly recommend!"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Sumptuous,"It was an excellent dinner. It was tough to book but managed to get a date in the restaurant. The food is excellent and the service is wonderful. We were helped by Ms Donna Yeh and she was attentive, patient and deserving of high praise.  The Michelin stars are well deserved."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,20,Wait...this got 3 Michelin Stars???,"Went here recently for a lunch with a bunch of friends. We pre-ordered the duck and roasted pork ahead of time to ensure we'd get their signature items. We had very high expectations coming in given that this restaurant has received 3 Michelin Stars...what a let down this was.    Having dined at numerous Michelin starred restaurants around the world and in Taipei - I have to wonder if we just went on an off day because the meal was entirely underwhelming, bland and disappointing and nowhere near what I would expect from a 3 star establishment and for the price we paid.    The highlight of the meal was the duck which they light on fire and carve in front of you. The rolled up pieces of duck were tasty and had good flavor, skin was nice and crispy and the meat was moist and juicy at that point. This was indeed the highlight of the meal.    The duck leg pieces they served after that though were dry and not flavorful though the plum sauce was nice. We opted for the duck porridge over the soup for the third preparation which had a nice texture but was bland and underwhelming and needed seasoning. Adding some of the plum sauce made the dish better and more palatable.    The final preparation of the duck was duck meat stir fried with some vegetables. The duck was dry and flavorless and reminiscent of something you'd find in a rechao spot in Taipei. In my opinion, if you get 3 Michelin stars you need to elevate the basics like stir fried meat and vegetables to a whole different level...that didn't happen here and the consensus at the table was this was a very basic dish that doesn't reflect well on a 3 Michelin star establishment.    We also had the roasted pork which was juicy and tender and very lean, but lacked any depth of flavor and what you'd expect with a char siu / bbq roasted pork.    The char siu bao's were good -though pricey- and the spinach and salted egg dumpling was unique and nice and besides the first preparation of the duck were probably the other standouts of the meal.    Ambience is nice and service is attentive, friendly and efficient. But for nearly 3,000 NT$ a person and with 3 Michelin stars to its name, we expected a whole lot more and were incredibly surprised just how basic it was and how bland the flavors were. We left wondering if we just happened to go on an off day, but the consensus amongst everyone at the table was that it was a very underwhelming meal and not worth the price paid, nor reflective of the expectations one has of a 3 Michelin star establishment."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Very nice,"Service was good, and food was delicious. It was really useful to use EZTABLE. I hope I can use it again as soon as possible."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Excellent food & service,"The Duck was great! However, there were some other dishes that I would've loved to try if the restaurant had told me beforehand that pre-order is required. But overall the experience was great! Food was amazing! Worth it!"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Totally worth the 3stars,"and aside from the one in Modena, this will be definitely a 3⭐️ winner truly-deserving. Not even the creative ones in Japan matched their own cuisine’s authentic flavours. At Le Palais de Chine, the explosion of broth perfectly matched in each concoction was truly wonderful. We especially enjoyed the crispy baby duck, lobster in ginger & scallion and the 虾饺. ❤️❤️❤️The steaming 大禹嶺 was a perfect match to cleanse our palates after each dish 🥰 we had a wonderful time and we’ll definitely be back to try the other dishes!    我们去品尝很多不同国家的米其林三星-一星的餐厅，这里真是三星给得最准确了❤️每道菜都含有材料的原汁风味，独特的魅力依依显出。今天吃得好陶醉的是脆皮鸭，龙虾和虾饺。加上想着苏轼的诗，鸭子的原味吃到心里。也点对了大禹嶺乌龙茶，一口一口吃喝入味。谢谢大厨和各位服务人员，我们会再次去品尝其他菜式。好期待💕"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,"Good food, Phenomenal Service and Atmosphere.","Duck was incredible and definitely the most memorable dish of the night. The rest of the food were all high quality but just good for Michelin 3-star. The dim sum for example, is not going to impress like ""The 8"" in Macau does and you can get similar quality for cheaper elsewhere.    Service and atmosphere were exceptional. Extravagant decor while still managing to offer a comfortable dining experience.    Price is definitely on the cheaper side for Michelin 3-star. There are some ridiculously expensive items on the menu like bird's nest, but you can expect a good meal for 2.5~3K NTD per person.    Overall, a great experience that's worth the trip, although I feel if you opened the same restaurant in HK or Macau it probably would've got a 1 or 2 star from Michelin."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Probably the best BBQ pork in the world,"I visited quite a couple of times and there are 3 must ordered dishes. Bbq pork is definitely the best. The muscle tenderness is perfect and maintain a right balance of honey, bbq sauce and the taste of pork. The second dish is a thousand year egg veggie dumpling. This is a kind of dish that only offer here. The color of veggie is covered by a transparent skin. The 3rd one is the deep fried radish pastry. The salty ham amplified the white radish freshness and sweetness. Usually deep fried is equivalent to oily but the chef managed it super well.... which is hot but dried, feel like it is baked rather than deep fried. The choice of wine and tea is hugh. The services, is beyond the Taiwanese standard. And no doubt it clinched the Michelin 3 star. Must visit spot for foodie!"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,30,Good salad bar but main dish is mediocre,"Went for New Year's celebration with family, so we were able to see all the varieties of main on our table. The pasta was cooked too soft and the beef my brother ordered was way over-cooked. I would skip the main and simply go for the salad bar which is fulfilling enough."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Top Choice for my brother-in-law's birthday,"We picked this restaurant as soon as my brother-in-law booked his flight to Taipei for our wedding. And the quality of their food and service made the night perfect for us. Highly recommended the Cantonese duck and the roasted pork, which required reservations. Fantastic dining experience!"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,40,One of a kind experience,Food and service was good. We enjoyed the meal and the experience of eating at a good restaurant. Reservation was fairly easy too.

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Beautiful Chinese Restaurant,"Visited this place as it is considered the best Chinese restaurant in Taiwan. As coming as a couple, we ordered the BBQ pork set menu so that we can taste many dishes as opposed to ordering ala carte. The highlight was the BBQ pork which is one of the best I ever had. The set menu is mostly traditional Chinese dishes with some modern touches. Some of the dishes were a little difficult to comprehend (e.g. mala infused goby fish steamed in soy sauce), but the overall experience was positive. Good service for international clients.    Restaurant was very beautiful, and it was more casual inside than many other *** places I've eaten at."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,40,Amazing experience,"This was my first time dining at a Michelin 3-star restaurant. I ordered the most popular cuisine such as crispy roast duck, barbecue pork, and fried chicken. The taste for me was not uncommon but, in deed, they were very delicate and delicious. I am not the guy who knows the Michelin stars, but I am an ordinary person who likes to eat different famous dishes. What attracted me was the duck course flame show, which was prepared by the chef at your table. Next time, I will order the set menu to see what different inside!"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Extraordinary,"This was my first three Micheline Star restaurant ever and it did not dissappoint at all. Everydish was excellent. The baby duck was excellent, the bbq pork were memorable. The shrimp tempura rolls were also excellent. The pepper sponge cake was uniquely simple and delicious. we also had the lotus seed baoand they were a very positive surprise. The service and ambiance were both top-notch."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,A memorable birthday dinner,"Excellent food and ambience.  I brought my girlfriend here for a surprise birthday dinner so we went for the a la carte option.  Some dishes take some time to prepare (like the scallion pancakes), however they are well worth the wait.  We were well looked after by our waiter during the dinner who spoke excellent English and provided us with good recommendations.  An extra kudos to the staff who took care to bring us a nice little birthday dessert to finish off the evening.  I would easily come back here on another trip to Taipei!"

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,40,The best Chinese restaurant I have ever had.,"If you ask me how Gustoso restaurant is? I would say that it got Nice atmosphere and Excellent service. The manager Andy is a super nice host who can make the customers enjoy the meals just like home. serve you with good food and chat with you we warming greetings. When you look out from the window pane, you may see the beautiful streets which are famous because of the sea of flowers and trees aside. Of course, the food is delicious and delicate as well. Scenes they serve semi buffet, there are plenty of home made side dishes and dessert. My favorite main dish is the roast fish with zucchini, green pepper, and baby corns. The prize is from $700 to $2000. You may taste the diversity of the food according to your own favor. My family and I will definitely recommend this fancy restaurant to all our friends in the near future. Come visit and experience the amazing attraction of this place. You were not only be able to fill your starving stomach, but also fill your hungry heart."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,Great experience,As always the food is amazing  Fresh cooked  Fresh ingredients  Quality is upheld greatly  Amazed and grateful for the meal

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,10,Roasted duck was not tasty,"I ordered roasted duck with flame. I found that the duck meat was not tender at all. I suspected that the duck was roasted before, frozen, and re-roasted again. The duck apparently was not freshly cooked. I tried to call the restaurant about this, but the phone never got connected to anyone."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,30,Disappointed in the packaged set-menu sold on EZtable,"Two person set menu was ordered from EZtable with very little info about what the actual menu is. I misguidedly believed that a Michelin 3-star restaurant would not disappoint us with its food, but we were sorely dismayed by the cuisines presented. While the food seemed to be prepared to a high level of skill, it was often bland and at times bizarre (i.e. the fish course was aimed at numbing the palate... for some unknown reason). The few exceptional dishes could not salvage the overall experience--as some of the dishes were not just unsavory, but almost unpalatable."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,40,First Michelin 3 stars experience in Taipei,"I booked through EZTABLE before I visited my family in Taiwan. The reservation process is easy but also a little bit confusing. I apply NTD500 to each of person I thought that’s reservation fee, end up it also reserved two ducks which I don’t need. I called and changed to one Cantonese style roasted duck and one BBQ pork. Both of them are delicious but not that impressive. The service is definitely amazing, they even help you carrying to-go box and walk you all the way to parking lots. Considering it’s first 3 stars restaurant in Taiwan I might still visit again when I have foreigner friends visiting."

Palais de Chine Hotel -Le Palais,50,An amazing Hotel experience that I hope to repeat soon!!,"I organized a fast business trip in Taipei and booked a room at Palais de Chine just a few hours before landing in Taiwan.I travel for business not for leisure and I need to rely on top service: I can tell Palais de Chine has been for me an amazing hotel experience:far better than many famous branded hotel I experienced in Asia. All is perfect in this hotel. I checked in very late at night as my flight was delayed: At my arrival at hotel I was received like a superstar: I was given a very efficent check in and I was offered a complimentary snacks in my room: a plate of fresh fruit which I really appreciated. The staff of reception is very professional and kind and I liked so much their approach to me: professional but friendly. The hotel interior design itself is worth of a visit: the interion designers made a great job and created an atmosphere that reminded me of a real “ Palace” . The Palace experience comes  to a full fruition during the breakfast: the most amazing breakfast of all 2019 so far! I travel an average of 150 days per year and spend about 150 nights out in 5 stars hotel:well I can rate the breakfast of the Palais de Chine as the best ever in 2019: the food experience is amazing ,the quality is outstsnding, the service is perfect: I want to repeat the experience as I was so  deighted with the food variety and quality!!! I should spend a word also for the room: so quite and clean,with no dust in the corners,a fantastic bedkinen set in pure Egyptian cotton allowed me a perfect rest. it is really very very rare to reach this level of perfection: but this hotel is perfect in all areas that are important for a business man: reception,concierge,food and beverage,and room too. I had a fantastic time in Palais de Chine and I will come back 200% when im Taipei. Last but not least: this is a real top 5 star hotel by all means but they charge a very reasonable rate if compared with the product and service they offer!"

Taïrroir,30,"Food is ok, but the sommelier is unprofessional","I was there with my wife celebrating an event and have offered wine pairing. The Sommelier poured a Japanese wine for me before showing the bottle. Personally I don't like Japanese wine and refuse to take it. The Sommelier said it is their routine to pour the wine without showing the bottle. I insisted that I don't drink Japanese rice wine. So reluctantly he brought another wine and again poured it into the glass without showing and telling me what wine it supposed to be.  I , being quite upset by his reaction, decided to cancel the wine pairing and order a white and a red of my choice. The Sommelier came again with the bottle and asked me whether that was the right bottle which I confirmed. He did not spend one second to talk on the wine before ""pouring"" the wine. Apparently the bottle was under gas pressure and the wine was, in fact, ejected out from the bottle like opening a bottle of champine with some drops spilling out. I was amazed with his act but he insisted that was the restaurant standard way to pour their wine.  I didn't want to spoil my dinner so I didn't augue with him any more. After I finished the two glasses of wine (less thsn 90 ml each), I think I should let others and also the restaurant chef /owner know this is not acceptable to have service from a Sommelier in a three starred restaurant."

Taïrroir,50,A much anticipated dinner as one of the first line ups of fine dining experience for this trip...,"It has been over 4 years since I stepped into Taipei City and as usual, I promised myself this to be another mix of my favourite meal.. from local spicy hotpot to the most exquisite fine dining experience.    Our trip started off with dinner at Tairroir, a restaurant where booking is reasonably manageable if you make an effort early enough (unlike another well known Michelin star restaurant nearby where you have to make super efforts plus luck). We were seated in a mid-range distance from the open kitchen when I thought was very nice.    The food here is supposed to be a mix of Taiwanese local ingredients cooked in a French way... I ma not a fan of fusion cuisine but I found the flight of dishes pleasantly enjoyable. My favourite and most memorable course was the organic egg in congee, which I thought could be a signature dish highlighting the spirit of the menu.    I was a but surprised by the balance/mix of appetizers/mains/desserts... As I am not a huge fan of dessert, I noticed that there were 3 courses out of 10 that was sweet, but after trying them, which were light and refreshing, I did not find it against my taste-buds so much... overall surprisingly enjoyable.    One comment to share would be the sommelier's interaction. He was very enthusiastic and warm in sharing his background but I thought more could be explained on the red Burgundy I picked. Either it was assumed that I know too much about the wine or maybe the wine didn't need much introduction... and more frequent pulse checks would be nice.    In any case, it was a very memorable night, to at least try once..."

Taïrroir,50,Incredible.,"This was an incredible experience. The ambiance is very intimate with a clear view of the kitchen where the chefs work efficiently behind a sliding glass door. The hanging tin ceiling tiles and minimalist decor are complemented by ambient lighting to set a relaxed environment for insanely creative food.    The food. Magnificent. Beautiful. Delicious. Innovative. It exceeded our expectations in every way. The staff were brilliant, thoughtful and informative. The 9 courses were augmented with two chef additions of a fried oyster and a fish dish. The tea egg with congee - fabulous.    If visiting Taipei, this is an absolute must! Amazing experience and DELICIOUS! The French infusion (breads) and wine pairing made it exceptionally unique!"

Taïrroir,30,Excellent service but OK food,"I took my mom and brother to dinner at Taïrroir: service was excellent, but I was not impressed with the food. The appearance of some dishes was not enticing, and the food tasted bland.    Of the six main dishes, only two stood out in flavor, presentation, creativity, and originality: the smoked pigeon and the pu’er tea organic egg. For dessert, the salted pineapple was exquisite in its combination of textures and flavors.    2 Michelin star restaurants are labeled as “Excellent cooking, worth a detour.” Maybe in the past, Taïrroir fit this description, but the current menu doesn’t live up to the expectations."

Taïrroir,30,Appallingly mechanical service & confusion over the cuisine,"Taïrrior is remarkable in 2 aspects: the appallingly mechanical service, and the confusion over the food. The service was an injustice to the food. The food isn’t bad but it could be a disappointment depending on your expectations. There is an appalling mismatch in how the restaurant “marketing” tries to define itself, from what is actually served, as if the two never communicated.    1    The marketing defines itself as Taiwanese-French fusion cuisine. “Taïrroir, a simple but meaningful compound word, is fused by ''Taiwan'' in English and ''Terroir'' in French. It expresses a new spirit about Taiwanese cuisine of this generation, ''Locally-Global”. Tairrior “fuses terrior and French cooking skill, transforms Taiwanese cuisine spirit with global taste, Taïrrior leads each global taster to experience the exclusive delicate of Taiwanese cuisine"" (Tairrior website).    The bigger trouble is, the Taiwanese element in the presented food is MINIMAL at best. The food is simply pan-Chinese, NOT Taiwanese. The most Taiwanese thing about this is the occasional mention of local ingredients, like duck from Jiayi. We are served a rather Cantonese soup, Suzhou style noodle (蘇式煨麵, which, by the way, was the only dish clearly subpar), 紹興style sauced duck. The chef’s own interview describes a signature dish as Shanghainese and Cantonese duck (“經典招牌菜「迷魂香芋泥鴨」（65°C Silkie Egg, Taro “en Purée et Kueh”, Yilan “Ya shang”, Sakura Shrimp）就是把上海菜的八寶鴨與廣東菜的芋泥鴨解構” -Michelin website).    How exactly is this ""Let the world see Taiwan"" (“讓世界看見台灣”? How is this “讓台灣料理的聲音，被全球聽見” -Tairrior website)? There is nothing wrong with masterful Jiangzhe/Shanghainese cuisine, and nothing wrong with Cantonese cuisine--both my favorite. But the restaurant is apparently as confused about the difference between Taiwan and China as the rest of the world. It’s fine to serve Chinese food, just don’t fake it as Taiwanese.    The confusion can also be seen in the name of the set. The menu calls this “Qiu Lu Cai”, meaning chef’s special is incomprehensible to any Taiwanese, as it is the Mainland pinyin Romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the last 2 words and the mimic Mandarin pronunciation of the 1st word of the Taiwanese phrase “手路菜” (in proper Taiwanese Romanization: tshiú-lōo-tshài).    The biggest irony in this is that the chef, in an interview, denies this is even French-Taiwanese fusion cuisine. “外界雖然將他的菜色歸類為創意法式菜，然而他不認同被歸類，他就是他自己，「那不是法菜、中菜或台菜，那就是何順凱的菜」”.    Looks like everyone is simply confused about the cuisine. This is my interpretation of Tairrior.    Running confused on philosophy, Tairrior's dishes simply appear to be a random combination of gimmicks. Our waitress’s introductions are purely a memorized list of ingredients which clarify none of the confusion. For serious creative dishes, they need to more properly explain what the dish is supposed to represent, and the thinkings being conveyed through the dish. Otherwise, since there is no menu to choose from, it’d feel like being served whatever gimmicks are in the kitchen. The food itself though, is mostly fine, except for the disastrous noodles “蘇式煨麵” which is nothing like 蘇式煨麵 and more like soggy instant noodles, but I can overlook a dish. My own impression of Tairrior is that they primarily serve gimmicky food, resorting to Mainland gimmicks as they have run out of ideas from Taiwan.    2  The most appalling problem with this restaurant though, is the service. The service attempts to satisfy quality service through a checklist, which ends up being absolutely mechanical.    After the elevator door opens on the 6th floor, I see my guest has already arrived, with lots of staff around not in position. I was barely allowed to speak with the guest before the group of staff ushered us to a “procedure” at the station, which is to measure our temperatures and spray our hands. I thought we’ve arrived in a public hospital. We were probably only 4 minutes behind our booked time, surely they can hold a table for 5 minutes, why the hush? Even with the understanding that these are required protocols, the procedure is needlessly chaotic. The greeting experience is worse than what you’d get in average restaurants or half-decent massage parlors. Rather than coming around to you, they move and bug YOU so that they can show that you have been served.    After sitting down, in a restaurant which is smaller than what you’d expect, don’t even try to have a conversation. As one of the first tables to be seated, most of the restaurant staff simply lined up 2 meters away, where they stand and eavesdrop on our conversation, making us uncomfortable. They should have been smarter to put them somewhere farther away.    Regardless, we are prevented from a meaningful conversation anyway. We are constantly bombarded with interruptive, mechanical service. Every service entry, the waitress apologizes for the interruption as a way of catching everyone’s attention. What would we like to drink? Water. Then the waitress disappears, to interrupt us a minute later with still or sparkling. Then she interrupts us to tell us that the towelette is warm before serving towelette. How wonderful. Then she interrupts me so that I don’t put my belonging on the ground. Then she interrupts so we can all watch her open the water bottle and pour. Then she interrupts us to order, and repeats our order out loud (very mechanically). After we order wine from the menu, the waitress disappears, to come back to interrupt us—which year of that wine? Then the waitress brainlessly mutters to herself we ordered multiple glasses of the same wine before vanishing. We have to summon her to (wake up and) change that to a bottle. Then the waiter comes back with another wine list to confirm. Then, of course, the waiter properly interrupts so we can see the wine label, before disappearing and reappearing with an opened bottle to interrupt us for the tasting, and for us to watch her pouring performance. The interruption continues throughout the evening with her inaudible playback of introductions, and costly extra food options (which happens multiple times through dessert).    What’s wrong with this approach is that it makes the waitress appear busy — look we are offering 5-star service, look I am serving you, but it puts them at the center rather than the guests. The service totally falls apart in the details. The waitress manages to come multiple times to interrupt us with questions without picking up the dirty towelettes sitting in the middle of the table. Not only does the waitress not present the option of ordering a bottle for our group size, but she also does not recognize that when someone chooses a wine for the group, it means one bottle, not multiple identical glasses. Normally, waiters would at least realize and clarify. She just muttered the food introductions like a tape recorder, which all of us find it difficult to hear (we share the same native language so it’s not a language barrier). When we asked a question, all she could do was rewind and replay. When my party requests that the table be cleaned, I can’t believe the waitress responded “After This Dish.”    All the staff were polite, but it certainly feels like we are communicating with the real waiter though a polite messenger who knows nothing about dining.    Aside from the confused cuisine and robotic service, the restaurant decor is fine. Pictures of the restaurant are widely available. It is kind of smaller than expected. The visible open kitchen is a plus. The male toilet though, has a tiny step (like an inch) where you’d least expect—just low enough to be invisible, just high enough to trip a person. Even though the waitress warned about it, I still managed to trip (but not fall) over it.    In conclusion, with all the shortcomings, the food is decent, so if you ignore the price then the restaurant is fine."

Taïrroir,50,Very enjoyable evening,"I was in Taipei for a short holiday and booked my reservation quite last minute and very lucky to get a table. Innovative flavors using local Taiwanese ingredients, with a very excellent wine pairing. I really liked the Taiwanese white wine served during the wine pairing, my first time having Taiwanese wines! Service was very friendly and welcoming. A very enjoyable meal experience."

Taïrroir,40,Worth a try!,An unique way to experience Taiwanese cuisine with French fine dining touches. Petit four was impressive!

Taïrroir,30,The most honest and straightforward review,"I compared my experience at Michelin star restaurants (Total Stars: 15-20) to Tairroir based on dining in New York, USA and England, UK.  Ambience: 3.5/5 (beautiful and modern but not out of the ball park)  Service: 5/5 (impeccable and adjusted accordingly to food allergies/intolerances)  Taste: 2.5/5 (Hit and miss)  Presentation: 3.5/5 (Creative in delivery)  Value for money: 3/5  Overall: It is worth going if you have some time and cash but this should not be your end all be all experience dining in a Michelin Star restaurant."

Taïrroir,50,Perfect from start to finish!,"The team at Tairroir was amazing from start to finish. They were thoughtful, courteous, and engaging. The food was so creative, fresh, and delicious. One of, if not the, best Michelin restaurants we have ever been to."

Taïrroir,50,Wonderful experience 完美的經驗,"My partner and I came here for our anniversary. The staffs were really friendly and professional, and the whole environment was very comfortable. The food without saying was absolutely amazing and delicious. We had great time here and definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have a wonderful dining experience. If possible, I'd live to take my family there again.  我和我的伴侶來這是我們的周年紀念日。 工作人員真的很友好和專業，整個環境都非常舒適。 不用說的食物絕對很棒而且美味。 我們在這裡度過了愉快的時光，並且絕對推薦給想要享受美食的人。 如果可能的話，我會再次帶家人去。"

Taïrroir,50,Great experience at Taïrroir,"Enjoyed the New Year Eve's Lunch at Taïrroir , great food and great services too!  fusion the taiwan's tradition food into the dishes,"

Taïrroir,50,"Great Food, Great Service","I was so impressed with food. Great food was matched with great service. After the meal, I asked for menu so I can photograph it. I got a signed copy and hand delivered by the chef. Will surely come back if I find myself in Taiwan again."

Taïrroir,50,Great French-Taiwanese fusion,"Great presentation and super-tasty meals. Even though everything was amazing, I was the biggest fan of the desserts. They are able to cater for dietary restrictions if informed in advance. The service was superb and easy-going! Definitely worthy of the 2 Michelin stars they have."

Taïrroir,50,Little gem in Taipei,"Friendly and professional wait services - all staff were knowledgeable about the food source and wine origins.    Food and wine quality was high, as expected of a Michelin two star restaurant."

Taïrroir,50,Great dining experience,"Food was innovative and delicious. Service was immaculate. All and all, a great dining experience and worth the 2-star accolade. I will return the next time I visit Taipei."

Taïrroir,50,Tairroir Fantastic dinner experience,"Wonderful Taiwan food material,GOOD Taste and beautiful looks ,Delicious & Delicate,with the ARTISTIC Deco"

Taïrroir,30,“Trying to be” type of restaurant,Contemporary Taiwanese with French influence but menu / flavor was nothing special. Either you do it thoroughly with all Taiwanese delicacies with a modern touch or simply don’t do it. It’s one of those “trying to be“ restaurant but not exactly there yet. There are plenty of better alternatives with this price in Taipei.

Taïrroir,30,A special experience.,"It’s our first time to enjoy the meal in a 2-star restaurant. Undoubtedly, the plating is creative and the dishes are tasty. Yet, maybe our expectation are too high, it is somehow not too match with it’s price for us.    To be honest, the dishes was not really surprising. It’s certainly a great restaurant for trying a Michelin rating, but maybe not too worthy for re-consuming again. Night market would probably find something more surprising with the same price. Cheers:)"

Taïrroir,40,Food and service was excellent. Forget the wine pairing.,"This is my second trip here. The first was in 2017 when there was no Michelin star awarded as yet.  I must commend the level of service and the quality of food. We took the lunch menu which was nicely curated and beautifully executed. Food was fresh, brimming with robust flavours.  On the wine pairing, I must agree with Fredrick007 who reviewed them unfavourably. The amount of champagne poured into my glass was paltry. By the time the bubbles settled, I was astonished that the glass was only 1/3 full. The white and red wines also merely reached 20-25% of the glass. (i understand the white wine and bordeaux glasses are meant to be big, but the amount of the wine poured was really disappointing) Maybe it is best the restaurant specify how much they were going to pour, ie 125 mls or 200 mls etc, just like in the European restaurants. This will remove any ambiguity.  For 980+ NTD each person for the 2 glasses of wine pairing, and given that there were two of us, I should have just brought my own bottle of wine and pay for the corkage."

Taïrroir,50,Excellent,"Food is beautifully presented, service is very good. Especially the Sommelier Campbell is very professional and knowledgeable.    The Spence between each table is a little bit too close. If reduced tables to create cozier feelings the food price should be increased?    Anyway it’s definitely worth visiting again."

Taïrroir,40,Very good service and environment. Food is OK but not value for money.,Food is OK but I don't think it is worthy of 2 star rating from Michelin and overcharged.    Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Taïrroir,50,Lunch at Tairroir,"Food is excellent, interior is beautiful, service is very good. However when you order a wine pairing (especially at NT$990 per person) you would expect at least two regular glasses of wine, instead we got a very small portion that did not carry us through even the first of two dishes it should cover.  Too bad since otherwise this would be a great lunch, now we feel somewhat overcharged"

Taïrroir,50,Great Dining Experience- 很棒的用餐經驗,This French restaurant emphasizes on its Taiwan spirit & essences. I can feel the creativities & chef’s passionate heart by dining through the gourmet. Some Chinese tastes such as Sichuan spicy tofu & breakfast congee are nicely mixed inside this French set. The eye catching beauty with delicate details are in all dishes. The service is great & the place is designed and very comfortable. No wonder it is Michelin starred!  這家餐廳是法式料理但是強調他的台灣精神和內容，整個用餐過程可以深刻感受到創意和主廚團隊的用心，有些中國式元素例如麻婆豆腐和早餐的粥等等台灣或中國元素很巧妙的在這個基本上是法國套餐的某部分出現，你會盯著看的美麗和細緻的細節隨處可見，服務很棒、餐廳設計還不錯而且舒服，難怪是米其林餐廳！

Taïrroir,50,Occassion Dinner / Great Experience,"We went here for a birthday dinner and booked a private dining room for two.  The service was impeccable and very smooth. Each dish and drink was explained well.  We went for the the full tasting menu and after a while it felt like the food kept coming and coming in :)  The attention to detail is impeccable, our requests were accommodated for certain foods we wanted to avoid, there is enough breathing space between each course coming in. All in all we had approx. 13-14 dishes topped off with some tea and dessert selection.  The experience was spread over 2.5 hours and every fit fantastic.  Advance reservation is a very good idea since they tend to be booked out.  Considering it is on the fairly pricey side - it makes for a good destination for celebrating occasions.  Thanks for the fabulous memorable evening!"

Taïrroir,50,Excellent Dining Experience!,"Great recommendation from a family friend. The service from staff are lovely, and the menu is fabulous."

Taïrroir,40,A journey to excellent food and service,"I’ve been to Tairroir and I enjoyed a lot, so I came back with my parents in this summer to indulge in the Michelin experience.    We had the lunch menu and appreciated the modern twist with the authentic Taiwanese dishes and local ingredients. The staff are well trained by introducing each dish in details with sincere attitude.    Tairroir deserves to be a 2-star Michelin restaurant!"

Taïrroir,50,Perfect marriage dose exist！,"Every dish was focused on creating good tasting experience rather than making fancy gestures. Perfect marriage of seasonal local ingredients and exquisite culinary techniques. Refined, controlled and yet ambitious ! Mr. Kai Ho is re-creating the taste of Taiwan."

Taïrroir,50,Great Dinner,All food is extremely good. Food Material is from traditional source but they just drive the taste to limit. The staff is helpful and nice! Wish to visit again next time.

Taïrroir,50,"Good service, detailed description on menu","Detailed oriented service, waiter and waitress are knowledgeable on menu.  Food was excellent just one suggestion, the sorbet is preferred to be served between soup and main course to rinse the palate, or else it feels like having two desserts."

Taïrroir,50,Surprise birthday dinner,The food and service was awesome! Flew in from the Philippines to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We love everything especially the dessert part!♥️

Taïrroir,10,不值得推薦,"I wouldn't say that I am an expert at fine dining or a qualified food critic; however, I have been to many several worldwide famous restaurants in the America, Asia and Europe. Both my husband and I went to Tairroir with high hopes, but disappointed with both the food experience and services. We can clearly see that the chef tried to innovative, but the technical skills are not savvy enough to make good execution, as such, the dishes and flavor turned out to be very confusing. There was one dish with ""truffle"" and bamboo shoots, the flavor of which made us to doubt if that was real truffle...Regarding the service, the end of the meal was the most awkward moment I have ever encountered in all restaurants i have been to, the waiter handed me the receipt which included the service charge and a blank tip area for me to fill in. The waiter helped clarified that the service fee is different from the tip and he will not receive any service fee. He then just stood next to me looking at me to fill out the tip amount, which made me feel that he was just pressuring the clients to give him a good tip. We don't think we would ever go back, and we will never know how this place is until we went--so once is enough I think. chef有希望創新，但是執行能力為達到水平，菜的味道和服務都讓人大跌眼鏡。但是如果不去的話，也沒有辦法知道是否喜歡，但是真的不值得推薦。"

Taïrroir,50,French haute cuisine with a whole lot of Taiwanese terroir twist,"1. excellent service  2. great ambiance; ample space between and among tables given the limited square footage  3. sourcing excellent local ingredients (lots of farm-to-table sources)  4. kudos to the chef's palpable deconstruction, which engages with the diner an intellectual conversation regarding food preparation techniques, seasonality and freshness of food ingredients, and his personal philosophies on Taiwanese-French fusion  5. hardware (wall panels, the rack for the ""piped-in music"", the mounting works of the urinals) of and in the restroom needs to match up with all other aspects the restaurant chef and owner wish to project"

Taïrroir,10,Interesting idea but experience fell short of the hype,Love the idea. Staff provided Excellent service- though some patrons were quite loud which ruins the overall experience. Food was average- though excellent in display but the taste and texture were short of Michelin quality..

Taïrroir,50,French Flair with Taiwanese Elements,"Had a wonderful evening dining at Tairroir. Food was prepared with excellence and the service was impeccable. No details were spared to create the atmosphere. From the table setting, to the dining room, bar area, dessert trolley and even the toilets, the team at Tairroir has put in a lot of thoughts and efforts into the place to enhance diner's experience.    My favourite dishes would be the Pu'er Tea Silkie Egg with Sweet Potato Fondant, Plain Dentelle and the Bitter Gourd Sorbet! The egg dish somewhat triggered a warm and nostalgic emotion while the bitter gourd sorbet (a pre-dessert dish) is just so innovative, bold yet simple in presentation. Exactly right down my alley. The combination is pure genius (bitter contrast with sweet and sour in perfect balance).    Special mention to the Onion Potage, Homemade Lardo, Comte Lemon Gougeres and the Guguan Beluga Caviar, Yellow Garlic Chives, Clam, Bean Sprouts, Bonito Flakes dishes. I would love to have these again any time.    Tairroir lives up to not just the hype, but also it's brand and of course it's MICHELIN Stars. I believe it is set to become an iconic and well-respected food brand in Taiwan in the coming years. In the meantime, I am looking forward to head back to try out their lunch menu next time."

Taïrroir,50,Deserving of its Michelin stars,"I truly enjoyed the tasting dinner at tairroir . I really feel the chef has designed a menu that sings odes to chinese ingredients and have completely elevated chinese cooking into something truly amazing. When i eat each dish~ it feels like something familiar and yet still gives me an element of surprise in taste, texture, and synchronization of all elements combined. Totally deserving of the 2 Michelin stars."

Taïrroir,50,A very pleasant and stimulating evening,"The food was amazing in so many ways - beautiful dishes creatively produced.  I was very happy with the people working at Taïrroir, who all were very attentive to us and were very competent and engaged."

Taïrroir,40,Michelin starred restaurant with decent food,"We had a good, but not excellent dinner. Food was good, but not 2 star. Service was top notch. Sommelier was not very knowledible."

Taïrroir,50,High level cuisine and service,"One of the most unique dining experiences in Taipei, high level of service, exact cooking and attention to detail, some of the finest local ingredients sourced in Taiwan. Beautiful dining room with a show kitchen. It is a destination restaurant and the menu changes with the seasons. Highly recommended."

Taïrroir,40,A must try,"Tairroir was one of our most interesting experiences as the modern Taiwanese food and ingredients were presented with French / European influences, all the while preserving their uniqueness. My favourites: the Barley veloute with black truffle, etc. and the Chicken wing stuffed with braised abalone. Man, oh, man...    We were there for dinner and I can't speak any more complementary about the relaxed ambience, the excellent AND friendly service and of course the food.    (As an aside, as we are living in Australia, we don't have access to all wines of the world and the one we have had, Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux, Vosne-Romanee, Cote de Nuits, 2013, was seriously one of the best wines I ever had.)    Tairroir is right in the next building to RAW, so it is kind of easy to try both to compare. Though the food might be marginally 'moreish' in RAW, we much prefer Tairroir for all the positives listed above.    Hope to return one day."

Taïrroir,50,Excellent Dining Experience,We have been to Tairroir twice and each time does not disappoint. Excellent execution of using the traditional Taiwanese ingredients with French culinary techniques. All the dishes were beautifully presented and with a unique twist. A must try in Taipei!

Taïrroir,40,Innovative and modern twist,"Two kinds of set lunch could be ordered, we picked the simple one. Chefs used Taiwanese traditional ingredients to create innovative dishes, the taste was above average, the second dessert surprised us so much!  Servers were well trained, but would be upgraded. Like the fine dining restaurants, servers should put napkin on guest's thighs while seated, asked them what wine to order, then introduced menu. But the waitress of Tairroir gave menu and introduced first, then asked us to order wine of not, and we needed to put napkin by ourselves. This service is not Michelin star restaurant level."

Taïrroir,50,Superb lunch,"decided to book this place for lunch considering the high reviews and the michelin star, i was blown away by the service and the quality of food. the design of the restaurant was also very beautiful. will definitely return back the next time"

Taïrroir,50,Outstanding lunch,"We loved every moment of our lunch in This great restaurant. The food was outstanding. Every dish was unique, beautifully presented and tasted just great. Our waiter was outstanding, lovely, caring and professional. It was fascinating seeing the open kitchen and the cooks at their work.  We had the opportunity to talk to the chef even though he was busy preparing for a travel to China and we were impressed from him.  Lovely experience eating in this restaurant and great hospitality and service.  Very recommended."

Taïrroir,50,French + taiwan,Our second time here. They only have 1 degustation menu of about 8 courses. Most dishes are very good - classic french with some taiwanese ingredients. Small portions but they add up. The meal is finished with an over the top petit four trolley

Taïrroir,40,"Great food, Great Service!",Great food ... the whole menu was planned just perfect in terms of taste and portion! Service was warm and good.Will definitely visit again!

Addison Restaurant,40,Be warned,"Let me begin by saying that the food/service and ambiance were terrific. However, DO NOT be lulled into trying their champagne pre dinner service. Stupid me did not ask the pricing (shame on me) and they did not offer it ( shame on them) . They advised us of food upcharges but no notice of the cost of the champagne. I figured it would be expensive but$220 for a glass (and not even a generous pour) was beyond shocking! It wasn’t even their most expensive. it was close to deceptive as you can get. I have eaten in my fine Michelin restaurants but who would have expected that ! I was at least glad that my wonderful evening wasn’t ruined until receiving the bill. Be warned"

Addison Restaurant,50,Fantastic for Vegetarians!,"This restaurant is fantastic for vegetarians. They have a pre-set vegetarian menu, and the dishes are all prepared exceptionally well. The service is fantastic as well. Below are some pictures of the meal.    The restaurant's ambience is also absolutely terrific. It is a beautiful setting and a breathtaking dining room and facility.    The restaurant has free on-site self-parking!!!    Pro tips:  1. Make a reservation far in advance. But, if you need a reservation sooner, call and ask to be put on the wait list. They sometime have last-minute cancellations!    2. Leave yourself ample time to get to the restaurant. The restaurant is on the site of a luxury hotel resort. You may need a few minutes to get there once you get to the front gate."

Addison Restaurant,50,dessert,"zWell, everything was wonderful about the service and tasty and super creamy sweets, nothing like the others, it's all worth it"

Addison Restaurant,50,A lifetime experience,"Whether you frequently dine at Michelin starred restaurants or this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Addison doesn't disappoint.    From the moment you enter, you know that you are going to enjoy a best in class evening.    The location is sublime, with waterfalls, trees and lovely fauna as the backdrop.    The service excels. Each staff member was knowledgeable, made us feel welcome, and operated in synchronous harmony. Thank you especially to James, our lead waiter.    The food? Well, three stars won't lead you wrong. Each course was unique and wonderful, displaying the chef's creative genius.    Addison was truly a treat."

Addison Restaurant,50,Spectacular,This was the best dining experience ever. And I have experienced many Michelin rated restaurants. From the start we were treated exceptionally. The whole staff was awesome. The atmosphere was very relaxing. Every course was amazing. I savored every bite. I liked the parting gift and souvenir menu. I’d definitely eat here again. Highest praises to the chef and staff.

Addison Restaurant,40,wow,The food was delicious and creative. The ambiance is relaxing. The staff was friendly. Ian was amazing.

Addison Restaurant,50,Pricey but worth it,"Such an incredible experience! Preset minute curated by the chef. We joined after they announced their 3rd Michelin star (first week of Feb 2023). They do ask ahead of time if there are allergies or dietary restrictions.    Everything was perfectly orchestrated. My husband and I each had our own waiters, and rarely saw the same person twice. Cutlery was place in sync and dishes were placed and taken away like a perfectly choreographed dance. We were even taken into the kitchen and given a brief tour from the sidelines.    We had about 9 courses (27 plates total) and only one we didn’t love (the Squab). The meal was seafood focused.    They sent us home with a commemorative menu and house made granola - such a nice touch.    In total for 2 people (3 drinks each) we spent $1000    Definitely not cheap, but worth every penny for the experience!"

Addison Restaurant,30,Good but not spectacular,"This was a marvelous meal. The space is warm and romantic yet also spacious with high ceilings.    Reception was a bit awkward. I arrived 10 minutes early and was directed to a nice large sitting room with a fireplace where my date, who had arrived 10 minutes earlier, was waiting. The hostess had not originally made clear that we would be seated at the exact time of our reservation and not one minute sooner. Thus, I didn't understand what we were waiting for once both members of the party had arrived.    Also, I found it curious that we were not invited to wait in the bar instead of a sitting room. It seemed like we were expected to keep an exact schedule like a German train. During the meal itself, there was never a pause with an offer to relax a bit before the next course. Although our reservation was for the next to last seating, I was given the perception that the restaurant was eager to turn over the table.    Adding to the feeling of being rushed, at the beginning of the meal we felt pushed to accept several up charges: A5 Wagyu beef, white truffles from Alban, and a larger portion of caviar and a higher grade than what normally came with the pre fixe menu (which was already $395 a person).    I had to ask obvious questions, such as: what would the truffles go on? The answer, the steak, was not enticing.    The Wagyu was the only one that seemed it would be worth it. It was. However, since it's a surprise tasting menu it was not clear what the alternative would have been. What tiny cut of beef and what grade comes with the standard meal?    The food was excellent, but none of the dishes was ""wow!"" My favorites were the Kumamoto oyster and the Wagyu, but neither seemed unique. The desserts were plentiful.    Food service was excellent. The delivery was choreographed with two servers presenting/pouring simultaneously for each course so that everyone at the table is served at the same time. Everyone was courteous and each dish was described in detail.    Wine service, however, was disappointing. It started with a champagne cart. The server asked what sort of flavor profile I liked in champagne. I said I liked dry and elegant, particularly Veuve Clicquot. I don't know why he asked because he paid no attention to my answer.    They had four champagnes on offer by the glass: three Krugs (moderately expensive, expensive, and very expensive) and Roederer Cristal. He didn't compare any of them with each other (or Veuve Clicquot) but described the Krugs in terms of rarity and desirability. Never a word about taste and why one might be different to drink than the other. For the Cristal, he talked about the uniqueness of the bottle but not about the champagne inside.    For the rest of the meal, we ended up having wine pairings selected by the sommelier--even though his initial question about seeing the wine list to choose a bottle or something by the glass made no sense. How could we select wine with no idea about the food? At one point, he asked if we wanted a red or a white next. Again, I responded ""how can I possibly answer that without knowing the next course?""    Throughout the meal, the selection of wines for pairings was good but not inspired. The presentation could have been much better. In each case, a server showed the bottle and named the vineyard and varietals.    At this price point, I also expect a description of the maturation (American oak? French oak? steel? time in barrel(s)?) and flavors (grass? citrus? dark berries? leather? tannins? buttery?) and in particular, WHY it was chosen to pair with a particular dish.    Bottom line: it was a good meal, but not a spectacular one despite a spectacular sized bill.    Worth considering if you are willing to pay about a grand per person once up-charges, wine, taxes, and tip are included."

Addison Restaurant,40,"Excellent Table, beautifully lighted with Awful View","Definitively my first 2 star Michelin Experience. We booked via Open Table and we got arguably the best table. 9 courses. It was Amazing ! We don't normally fret about cost at a restaurant, but $ 1900 + 500 tip (2 people) made me ask if it was worth it ? Yes , we had 9 upgraded wine pairings with each course. No, we weren't quoted prices and no we didn't ask. Also, no there wasn't a written menu. I'm going to re-examine the worth of a Michelin Star let alone 2. I like views-Vistas ! And all we had here was a black as night golf course, but the table lighting was fantastic. And I know I'll be condemed; A5 Wagyu beef got fed to the dogs after being cooked. I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to like raw beef, even though we suggested it be cooked well. I feel like I'm missing something, lesson learned. Oh, and the parking was poor, at least we got to see some of the golf course."

Addison Restaurant,10,Worst Front of House Staff,I scheduled a reservation though our hotel and after the restaurant confirmed through open table they then canceled the reservation without warning. I called the restaurant over a dozen times and left half a dozen messages asking for clarification and no one ever answered the phone or returned my call. The extreme unprofessionalism has left a terrible taste in my mouth after my excitement to try their tasting menu.

Addison Restaurant,50,A dinner dreams are made of,"Wow! What a treat we sat center of the large and spacious dining room, there was ample space between guests you could feel like you could talk easily. We had 11 coureses we did the truffle add on and the wagu beef add on. We did the standard wine pairing. I have a gluten allergy and I only eat seafood Chef William accomodated my dietary needs beautifully. The caviar was amazing!"

Addison Restaurant,50,A 3 Star Experience!,Had the pleasure of dining at Addison last night for the first time. As a veteran of Michelin 3 stars both here and in Europe I can say this establishment deserves its 3rd star. The experience here is top notch from the minute you walk in and are greeted by the professional staff. Every detail is taken care of to the greatest extent possible.    The menu itself is comparable to the tasting menus I've had at Le Bernadin and Madison Park in New York and Alinea in Chicago. I enjoyed every bite of this meal and left feeling full but not bloated. I will definitely be back the next b time I'm in San Diego!

Addison Restaurant,20,An Expensive Lesson,"I have eaten a Addison several times and was really looking froward to my return.  Unfortunately things had changed.  We were both interested in the tasting menu which was a bit of dissapointemnt food was served at the wrong temperature.  My husband asked for a menu and has a really hard time getting one from anybody in the restaurant.  I gave the saiter carte blanche and ordered the wine pairing which was a huge disappointment.300.00 for 6 tastings of mostly mediocre wines(very sweet)which made me sick .Again I asked for the pairing menu and non was given.  When I called the restaurant the next day no returned my call.My husband tried as well and again no one responded.  I sent an email to the restaurant and again no answer.  ThIs is a michelin restaurant I guess they got their star and have no more time for their guests  We travel the world, an are both enthusiastic chefs ,and interested in fine food.  I would really like an explanation"

Addison Restaurant,50,An amazing Thanksgiving dinner — but a little too similar to our last two amazing dinners this year.,"Thanksgiving dinner at newly elevated 2* Addison at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar resort. We really enjoyed it, but we were a little disappointed it didn’t evoke any of the traditional Thanksgiving dishes. We should wait a bit to return until the menu is changed a bit — as the menu was more or less similar to what we already have enjoyed three times in the last year and was quite pricey at $2K for the two of us. (We both did the Wagyu additional course, I had the white truffle addition, I had the luxury wine pairing, and my hubby had the regular wine pairing. It added up fast.) To be fair, we keep returning (Sept 2020, July 2021, Sept 2021, and now Nov 2021) because the dinner experience here is so wonderful.    The food was sensational as always. The wine pairings were both wonderful, but the luxury pairing was even more of a step up than usual, we agreed — those really were stupendous. They clearly offered me some incredible wines in an attempt not to repeat some that I’d had in my many previous luxury pairings.￼    But another amazing highlight was the amazing 75 year Calvados Old Fashioned the manager comp￼’d us on arrival after hearing earlier that week about my troubles with the hotel — and perhaps because we’re such frequent dining guests. They also sent us home with a bag full of goodies for our puppy. We really do love the team here.    I can neither confirm nor deny having asked for and been obliged with a few extra helpings of some of the wines and desserts. 😉    Addison is very pricey — but well worth the cost if it’s in your budget. We just look forward to their menu changing enough so that we can return yet again."

Addison Restaurant,40,Birthday dinner,My wonderful wife booked this very e pensive restaurant months in advance. The service was over the top. They treat you like a conquering king. Food was very unique. Great experience.

Addison Restaurant,10,Ignorant on any level!,"Several attempts over a few months to get a reservation there remain unsuccessful. Voice mail messages remain unanswered, waiting lists never are recognized or at least you are told that nothing has changed and there won't be availability for the evening. With this attitude, no matter the food, I am not willing to spend a dime there! Maybe they just don't need any business anymore,........."

Addison Restaurant,20,Totally Underwhelming,"We were seated on a dark patio, after waling through a cavernous, empty,clearly not the main seating area. Bear in mind, this is a restaurant with a Michelin star and the five course tasting menu costs $185. The patio was barren, nothing to make is seem in the least inviting.  We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and have enjoyed many fine dining experiences on special occasions., unfortunately, this was not to be very enjoyable.    Our table was completely bare except for a dingy grey place mat. There was no decor on the patio that made is seem welcoming. We had to beg for a candle or additional lighting to be able to see our food.  We were forced to navigate a 100 page wine list on our phone, and told there were no printed copies, well, since this restaurant existed before COVID, they had copies of the wine list but simply would not provide it.  The same with a copy of the tasting menu, which would require one sheet of paper and not be passed on to other diners. As a result, I could not begin to describe any of the dishes we were served. I do recall that our first taste as an ""Arnold Palmer"" an homage to the fact that the restaurant overlooks a golf course, but, seriously ice tea an lemonade for $185? Meant to be playful but fell flat as there is nothing playful about this restaurant. We requested an email copy of the menu, but have gotten no response. Explanations of the dishes were perfunctory at best.  The coursing was unbelievably slow, thank god we only went for the 5 course because we were there from 8 to 11, if we had done the 10 course, we could probably still be at the restaurant.  Mostly the service was absent and the food lackluster, others have mentioned the wine parings, we were never offered that option. Overall we left feeling like we were an afterthought by the staff  In a city with such a vibrant, innovative dining scene, this restaurant has been left behind."

Addison Restaurant,50,Artful dining,We ordered the 5 course menu and it felt like 15 courses. I can't imagine what the 10 course menu offered. Each course has several small dishes and each dish is a small piece of art. The service and the ambience were top notch. My only complaint is that I should have been warned that after the bread came the main dish which was barbecued pigeon and by the time it arrived I was full! I guess that is not a bad problem to have. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Addison Restaurant,50,An amazing dining experience,"We ate at Addison 5 years ago, and again this week. We opted for the five course menu, which actually comprised 15 small plates of delicious works of art. Which were ""courses"", and which were amuse-buches wasn't clear, but it didn't matter each one (with one exception) was an amazing sensation for all the senses.    This is an expensive restaurant, and you should expect that it will end up costing at least $300 per person and last about 3 hours. But, it is a rare treat to be savored and enjoyed; and the Michelin star is well deserved. We found it significantly better than five years ago, and feel that the chef is getting better and better at his craft.    The cost of this culinary event should be viewed in light of the massive amount of work involved with the creation of these complex dishes, the creative plating, the huge amount of cutlery, the beautiful setting, and the dramatic simultaneous presentation by the staff for each dish.    The wine choices are vast but expensive. We had a half-bottle of an amazing Barbaresco (which is listed at $100 on the menu, but somehow morphs into $135 on the bill).    Seating is outside on the veranda, and there are adequate heaters. We needed ours turned on by the end of the evening. They plan to keep all dining outside this spring and summer. The staff all wore masks.    Overall, if you can afford a meal here, I recommend giving Addison a try."

Addison Restaurant,20,All hype lacking substance.,All hype lacking substance. This is not a Michelin star Restaurant even thought it tries to be.. Jeune Et Jole Carlsbad is a million times better!

Addison Restaurant,50,Perfection....,"I have been to three Michelin Star restaurants In France that don’t compare to this food and service. The wine list is extraordinary, the food is phenomenal and the service was perfection. Amazing."

Addison Restaurant,50,An unforgettable experience,"Our son and daughter in law took my wife and I out for a 10 course tasting and wine pairing dinner to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. The restaurant itself is elegant and understated, more like being in the main dining room of a French chateau. This is a dress-up experience. The staff seats each table and diner in unison. The serving is choreographed with one server per diner for each course. It resembles performance art and is quite effective. The food is served in a particular order followed by the paired wine. While each dish seems small, over the course of nearly 4 hours there is quite a lot of food.    As for the food itself, FANTASTIC! Flavor and texture combinations only a chef would even think of trying, and it all works!    This is something everyone should experience at least once in a lifetime."

Addison Restaurant,50,An Experience,An experience your palate and senses will delight in. If you have the stamina the ten course tasting menu with wine pairing it is quite the hedonists delight. Starting right with the amuse bouche and ending with the gift of chocolates when you leave.

Addison Restaurant,40,"5 star service, 4 star food","So I want to start out by saying that we are seasoned diners. Daniel, chef’s table at Brooklyn Fare, and Le Bernardin are what I am comparing this restaurant to. Most importantly, I want to point out that the service here is beyond amazing. The overall experience is a 10/10. There are very few places that provide this level of personal attention. The staff is choreographed to a tee but not pretentious, and still engaging and funny. We went to the Addison to celebrate our anniversary. We chose the 10 course option and ordered two bottles of wine with the help of the sommelier. The wine recommendations were lovely, and paired nicely with the food. Now the food. Overall it was beautifully presented with some amazing standout courses. The silverware and table accoutrements were also thoughtful and quaint. My husband had the kobe beef and I had the pigeon, both were melt in the mouth and top quality. The char course, and the horseradish pot de crepe with caviar, and crab were also standouts. A few items were a bit of a let down, however, i.e. the artichoke au gratin - a tough little patty in sauce, a king crab and avocado petite saveur - guacamole in a cigar paper, and some sort of fruit salad with tomato broth. They also brought a chip and dip course in the middle which was really odd and incongruous, but we honestly appreciated the bread course because we were hungry. Overall I think I was hoping for all of the courses to have some type of seafood or other protein for the level of this restaurant and the price. The price is, well, high. It is in line with other higher Michelin starred restaurants. I think we will go back, if for nothing else to experience the service once again."

Addison Restaurant,40,Fantastic food and service.,"All of the dining options at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar are top notch. They are also priced to match, but worth it in general."

Addison Restaurant,50,"Annual 10-course, with pairing","Once again, the Addison does not disappoint. Every visit here is a palletary delight with an entirely new menu, except of course for the one little creampuff that comes on the second course. Last night was modestly busy, with 12 tables for, which is quite a bit for the Addison. They tend not to turn tables, since a single seating will usually take three hours. The pairings were incredible, this time six whites from sparkling to rose were presented as we move through a number of dishes including an excellent caviar, before introducing the Reds one of which was accompanied by Kobe beef 45. Absolutely incredible. We took a brief tour the kitchen, as we usually do, before finishing off with an exquisite 75-year-old cognac."

Addison Restaurant,50,Michelin needs to give Addison 2 stars !,"An amazing series of surprises. Definitely recommend the 10 courses, each was deliciously portioned and we did not feel stuffed at the end. Service is seamless. We were seated in a comfortable private booth. You are given the menu at the end so enjoy the meal without any expectations other than superb food. Addison is a Michelin one star restaurant that is at a Michelin 2 star level. A definite must visit for serious foodies."

Addison Restaurant,50,"Impeccable service, amazing food. Recent Michelin Star.","Addison is the best restaurant in San Diego, hands down. The service is impeccable and the food is creative and delicious. I have done both the 5 course and the 10 course meals. The 10 course is wonderful, but frankly it is just too much food for me. I usually get the 5 course with paired wines."

Addison Restaurant,50,Still teh most outstanding restaurant in San Diego,It's been one year since we last ate here. There is no longer a menu; the chef decides each day what the courses will be. The food is terrific and unusual. The service is outstanding. Plan on spending 3-4 hours for this dining experience. I suggest the wine pairing as well. You will be quite full at the end of the 10 to 11 courses. It's expensive; plan on $500 per person with the wine pairing. But it is worth it. We plan to eat here at least once every year. The venue is also delightful. Have a cocktail overlooking the golf course before dinner.

Addison Restaurant,40,Superb Dining!,"We went here for a date night. We drove a coupe hours for something new, and this place was a good pick. I cant wait to make another drive up again."

Addison Restaurant,50,Don’t miss,"This was an amazing dinner with a crazy price tag but worth every bite! 5 star Michelin , only one in San Diego!! Every course was truly an experience . It was a special occasion and there is nothing we would change! Service was stellar! James paired our wine perfectly!"

Addison Restaurant,50,Choreographed excellence!,"My wife and I are very fortunate to have dined in many of the world’s great houses of gastronomy. Last evening we placed Addison into our top 10. Addison is not for everyone; it’s a high ticket , 3 hour visit to your sight and senses. IF you are a serious foodie you will truly enjoy this glimpse of serious food and service excellence.  First impressions are of a beautiful restaurant and salon, graced with high ceilings and plenty of marble. A grand fireplace dominates the dining room.  We chose the 5 course dinner; not due to price, but the fact as we have gotten older, we just can’t eat that much. If I were 20 years younger, I would have definitely let the chef do his thing.  Our meal experience started with glasses of Krug Champagne. Our first course was a Cucumber Granite with Yogurt and Yuzu essence. Next came the “Petite Saveurs”, consisting of an Oscetra Caviar and Egg Mousseline Tart, a cheese filled Gougere and Smoked Wild King Salmon mousse in pastry “cigarette” with Salmon Caviar garni.  Our next course was Alaskan King Crab and Peeky Toe Crab with Coconut, Thai Basil and Passion Fruit.  A course of whimsy was a play on “ Chips and Dip”; again excellent.  A course of Wild Sea Bream with Tapenade, Artichokes and Bottarga was delicious.  Sweetbreads with Black Truffles, Iberico Ham and Smoked Potato Purée was finished with freshly grated Parmesan. It was our favorite of the evening.  A loaf of freshly baked Parkerhouse Rolls was served with three different and delicious butters including a dill herb butter, Honey butter and Butter sprinkled with Fluer de Sel.  Barbecued Duck Breast was the next course. It was garnished with a marinated Cherry, Duck Liver mousse, pickled Mustard and Duck Jus with Red Cabbage. Outstanding!.  A Riesling Sorbet with Melon Pearls and 24 Karat Gold Leaf was served to cleanse the palate .  Dessert was a Chocolate creation with Cassis, Cocoa and Salted Caramel.  Our mignardise consisted of Chocolate Ganache Tart, Frangipan Petit Four and Fruit Gel. We did enjoy a half bottle of Kosta Browne 2014 Pinot Noir, along with Coffee and Tea.  There was a choice of Grade 5 Wagyu, along with a Cheese course, which we did not partake of  Finally, our service team presented us with a beautiful box of Chocolates, along with a printed copy of the evening’s menu. Our car was waiting for us after this presentation.  The beautiful choreography of service, along with the chef’s bold cuisine statement, makes this an event to remember.  We highly recommend Addison and look forward to a return visit."

Addison Restaurant,50,"Best, Most Extravagant Restaurant in San Diego","There are many outstanding, ritzy restaurants in the San Diego area. This one is the best, most extravagant dining experience in the county. It is fairly out of the way, but it is well worth it. The staff has been well trained and it is fun, just to watch them cater to other tables. It's like a choreographed dance. The cocktails are amazing and their wine list is extensive. The food is outstanding. They only have two things on the menu (not quite). They either offer a 5-course meal or a 10-course meal. Everyone at the table has to order the same number of courses. Even though the portions are small, they fill you up. I can eat a lot, but I was completely satisfied after my 5-courses (overall, they give you more than 5, do desserts count? We had at least 3, plus a couple of pallet cleansers). We kept thinking that the next course was going to be the last, but they kept coming. It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. Their menu changes with what's available during a particular season, but only with the highest ingredients. During our dining experience (I won't go into the multiple pallet cleansers or multiple desserts), we were served caviar tarts alongside puff pastries with bacon liquid inside accompanied with salmon wrapped in a crispy shell. Next was a lobster and crab in a vanilla broth, accompanied with a crab and shrimp cracker. Next was a sea bream that was perfectly cooked. It had a slight heat, which was a pleasant surprise. After that, was a rich sweetbread with potatoes and shaved black truffle. It went really well with my earthy red wine. It was followed by a grilled duck that was over a flame. You could really taste the smokiness. It stood alone, but it also came with 6 items to accompany it (pate, soaked cherry, mustard, grilled onion, a reduction and a berry paste). I'm not a dessert person, but the desserts that followed were amazing. I won't get too into them, but there were pickled pears, dessert wine sorbet, a chocolate dish that incorporated 6 different types of chocolate, coconut macaroon, sugared jelly, chocolate tart. They also have a supplemental cheese cart, but I was too full to indulge myself. A true 5 star event."

Addison Restaurant,50,Excellent Choice for a Special Occasion,"We love a good experience, and when we learned that Addison had received a Michelin Star earlier this month we decided it was time to give it a go. First of all let me tell you that the place, service and food are all fantastic, you can immediately tell why this place was considered for this over others in the city; there’s simply no other place that compares to the level of service and attention to detail in San Diego. Now how does it compare to other top restaurants in the world that we’ve visited? Well surprisingly well!    One of the things we love about this kind of experience is how everything is perfectly synchronized. From the moment our party was seated to every single plate. Even going to the restroom is an experience as one of the waiters will walk you over. Again, attention to detail is the difference.    On to the food, the menu consisted of two fixed 5 or 10 courses. We chose the 10 course menu of course. Unfortunately for me, I was driving and didn’t do the full wine pairing, which from what I hear is fantastic. We started with something called Amuse Bouche, which has cucumber flavored Ice, it opens up the flavors and it was very good. It followed with something called “Petite Saveurs” which was one of the highlights of the night, it had a mini Croissant filled with butter that just exploded in your mouth with flavor, absolutely delicious.    The Fruiste de La Terre on Olive oil was also one of our favorites. We then followed with the Alaskan King Crab followed by another highlight: The Confit of Sturgeon, which had Kaluga Queen Caviar with a vermouth sauce. Fabulous.    The Loup de Mer (Artichokes, Bottarga, Tapenade) and Smoked Sweetbreads (which had black truffles, they do a whole little act there to accentuate the smell) were probably our least favorite but very good nonetheless. We had the option to add an A5 Wagyu, which we did, and it didn’t disappoint. It had caramelized eggplant with Japanese sauce, which was delightful to the mouth and nose. We ended with the final course which was probably our least favorite, the Fromage Saisonnier. Finally it eneded with the two desserts, Vacherin Printemps (Meyer lemon and Huckleberries) and the Creme de Cafe which was my favorite of the two.    Overall it was good value, you should expect something along the lines of 400-500 per person if you include the pairing, and 600 if you include the Wagyu. I will definitely come back, it’s one of those places that shows elegance and demands your full attention once you get in to the meat of things."

Quince,50,Excellent on all Accounts,"This Michelin three star restaurant is excellent and worthy of its three stars. We had what seemed like a 50 course meal (not really but it seemed that way). At the end we could not even eat the last course, the squab. Everything was excellent from all of the many dishes, including the two desserts. Service was also excellent. The wine paring was among the best parings with lots of interesting wines. We also had the white truffle pasta which was good, however not a standout. The bill for two was approximately $2,200 with tax and tip. A lot for sure, but it was a memorable meal."

Quince,30,Quince???? What happened,"Perhaps my disappoint was that Quince mostly failed my expectations but rather it didn’t live up to what their promise is.  Service was great, staff were generally knowledgeable and helpful.  We had the truffle and the wine pairing and the extra offering of the added pasted course.  The truffle was certainly underwhelming. I barely smelled the flavor on most of the courses.  The redeeming dishes were limited. Perhaps what stood out was the desert.  The wine pairing was literally terrible. Nine of us finished our glasses and we usually drink wine by the case!!  Bread was delicious!! Lol"

Quince,50,So happy to be back!,"Quince reopened this week and it was as if they never left. We were pleased to be able to choose the 4 course option as 9 courses sometimes feel like too much.    We started with the beautiful canapes then to the caviar. The brioche was melt in your mouth delicious. Then on to the pasta course with bone marrow and we ordered the supplemental beef which was amazing.    We asked about a cheese course and while it isn't back yet, they did bring us a plate prior to dessert.    dessert was light and fresh. We felt very taken care of and no change in the 3 Michelin Star service."

Quince,40,Slurp,Must visit place. Its a feat for the eyes and the stomach with so much to offer and choose from. Highly recommended.

Quince,10,Worst,I asked for the waiting list for dinner at 7:30 pm and they told Me to come along... when I got there they said my name has passed at 530. I don’t understand how it changed from 7:30 to 5:30 Now I don’t have any other place to go for dinner. They did nothing about it.  I tried to contact them 6 days before and never answered.

Quince,50,SUPERBE EXPERIENCE,"The whole experience was fabulous and food/wine true to 3 michelin stars....  The staff knew in depth what they were serving and giving you an insight on what you were about to taste..  Perfect evening filled with phenomenal food, marvelously presented with a unique story to each course"

Quince,50,You can’t visit San Miguel,"You can’t visit San Miguel and not visit Quince. The service and the food are amazing. I couldn’t get enough of the view. Our waiter, Oswaldo was very attentive and took care of us great! We were very impressed with his service. I would def be back to Quince!"

Quince,50,Perfect,"I was previously lucky enough to eat at Quince in their private dining room - that experience was fabulous. This time around I took a colleague for dinner at the last minute. The staff were, as before, charming and inviting. The space is warm and welcoming and very comfortable. We both opted for the tasting menu with some additional wine pairings (and some additional additional pairings along the way!) Plenty of reviews have been written about the delicious food. What I want to mention is the quiet attention given by the staff to identify what a diner has really enjoyed and to further encourage that enjoyment: our waiter noticed that I’d really delighted in one of the dishes and another of the wine pairings. Without any request on my part an additional variant of the dish and possible other wine options for that dish appeared - it was fantastic!    Thank you all - and best wishes for the future."

Quince,50,"Quince - Great, Yet Again!","Quince - Great, Yet Again!    We are currently doing our “swan song,” regarding our favorite restaurants in San Francisco. For 15 years, we were in that city, at least once a month, and always enjoyed our dining there. Those business trips are winding down, as my wife’s corporate offices have moved to Chicago, so our trips to San Francisco are slowing coming to an end. We have set out to dine at our favorite restaurants in that great dining city, and Quince has always been at the top of our list.    A Sommelier friend gave me the name - Quince, at 470 Pacific Ave, by Chef Michael Tusk - “you MUST dine there!” I took him at his word, and did so, shortly after they opened. Unfortunately, my wife had a dinner meeting that evening, so I was solo. She was able to sneak in and have some wine with me, as I was finishing up the Tasting Menu. I knew that I had to return, and with her. Soon, I did. Over the years we have watched them expand the restaurant, and gain Michelin Stars along we way. We have had many excellent meals there, as well as having attended several culinary events, such as Chef Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern, in NYC. Each meal, each visit, has been extraordinary, and then, there are the wonderful wine pairings. Quince quickly became our favorite restaurant in San Francisco, and one of our favorites, around the world. This August visit, was no different, than all of the rest, and I was able to dine with my wife, for the entire meal, which is always a big plus for me.    The restaurant is lovely on the inside, with a sense of refined elegance, in every aspect. The staff was wonderful, as always, and so was the meal - The Chef’s Tasting Menu, and as per our usual, the Sommelier’s Wine Pairings. The lighting is subdued, but one can still easily take in the culinary artistry, appearing before them. The dishes are all a sight to behold, but unlike some chefs, Michael Tusk does not resort to cryo, or pyro-technics, but just artistically created plating and food. The tables are well-spaced, so service is easy, even in the banquette seating areas, which we had, near the front entrance, and in the main dining room. The noise level is usually quite low, and was on this visit. It was easy to hear the description of each dish, and each wine. With the table spacing, we could barely hear anything else in the room. Just a lovely evening. Also, the floral arrangements were magnificent.    Their menu changes with the seasons, and often with even greater regularity, depending on what Chef Tusk has available. Some years ago, they created Quince Farm, so have a more constant supply of various items, but then, there are still the Seasons, so the menu will change. Most of their menus showcase the produce from the farm, and then much of the rest is locally sourced, so it can depend on what is ready to come to the table.    We did the full Tasting Menu (an abbreviated version is available in their Salon), with 10 Courses, and two Amuse Bouche Courses, plus the Sommelier’s Wine/Beverage Pairings (do not be surprised if a Sake, or an Ale shows up at the table), which ran right at $300 + $275/diner, and was well-worth the price. Now, we did start the evening off with a glass each of Krug, from the Champagne Cart, so that did run the price up a bit. Each dish was a culinary, and visual delight, and each wine/beverage complimented each dish wonderfully..    Pacing was absolute perfection, with no pauses, and nothing rushed, at any time. Our 4-top did accumulate a lot of wine glasses (we like to save a sip, or two, just to see how they go with later dishes), but we still had ample room for the plates, and more wine glasses. Service was flawless, and I really appreciate that the Sommelier took the time to talk a bit about each wine, and why it was chosen to pair with each dish. The stemware was all Zalto, or Riedel, and every stem was varietally appropriate to the wine/beverage inside - lovely to behold, hold and sip from.    A highlight of this visit was a tour of the kitchen - probably the one place where we had never been at Quince - and an introduction to Chef Tusk. We got to sit at a little table there, with our wine, and watch the staff in action. Plus, the Sommelier remembered that we both loved the Philippe Colin Montrachet, and had two glasses of that waiting in the kitchen! He then had two black wine glasses at our table in the dining room, and we had to guess the wine - things, such as that, really add to the overall dining experience.    A beautiful evening, with my beautiful wine, in a very refined, and elegant setting, with fantastic food - just another perfect evening. Quince is one restaurant, that we would fly to San Francisco, just to dine there - and we have done that for a couple of their special dinners, already. We’re also scheduled to attend a culinary event with Chef Tusk, at a little place in the Smoky Mountains, next Summer."

Quince,50,Highly recommend,This has to be one of the finest dinning restaurants I've every had the pleasure to dine at. The food was splendid and me and my wife enjoyed the entire experience.

Quince,50,Best Dining Experience Ever,"My wife and I celebrated her 50th birthday at Quince. It was undeniably the best experience we have ever had at a restaurant. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with friendly, attentive and accommodating service that went well beyond anything we could have expected. The restaurant runs like a well oiled machine and all of the staff are top notch. The food and wine pairings were outstanding and each course was another wonderful new experience. This is the first review I have ever posted and I was compelled to do so after having the most memorable dining experience ever. Thank you to all the staff who made my wife’s 50th birthday dinner an evening that neither of us will ever forget. Highly recommended!!!"

Quince,40,"Something has happened to the kitchen, the food isn't great but everything else is.","I suspect that the founding father chef Mike Tusk isn't in the kitchen. The meal started with a vaguely grotesque buddha's hand stuffed with raw fish, and went course by course from there, many things just didn't hit the superb dishes from before. The food was vaguely strange, but all was good the service was astounding, as was the place."

Quince,50,Splendid and Special,"We celebrated a special occasion here in Sep 2019. The food was fresh, awesome and delicious. Really enjoyed the 2 desserts! We were amazed at the range of mignardise on the cart as well. We truly appreciate the attentive, thoughtful and wonderful service. This dining experience has been added to my treasure trove of special memories. Kudos and thanks to Quince!"

Quince,50,Serviced unmatched anywhere else.,"The genuine care from every staff member was truly inspiring,. You most definitely feel the care in the air here. Also staff are of course very knowledgeable, Its obvious their are passionate about hospitality.  The FOOD was incredible and beyond words. Words cant even express the joy in my mouth and belly from every single bite that I took, I couldn't help but to oooohhhhh and ahhhhhhh... Amazing in every way! The restaurant feel is pure magical with class and a sense of warmth.  I may need to become a spoke model for Quince so I can eat here weekly!  Thank you Chef Micheal for greeting us, That i'll never forget! you're incredible as well as your restaurant and team!"

Quince,50,Food as Art,"This place is phenomenal. It isn’t a meal, it’s an event. You will want to train for this marathon meal before you attempt it. And if you arrive ready for an entire evening of eating you will be able to savor every bite and each breathtaking presentation. Don’t rush, don’t plan anything else for the evening and take it all in."

Quince,50,Outstanding in every way,"There is little more to be said that hasn't already been shared. The food is amazing, the service is impeccable, and the wines were divine. It's difficult to imagine having a more delightful experience than dining at Quince. And imagine having the available staff all to yourself and 9 other guests--that makes it even more special. A wonderful, wonderful dining experience."

Quince,50,Meal of a lifetime!,"Best meal I have ever enjoyed. Staff was impeccable and friendly. Food presentation was amazingly refreshing and we never felt full, just satiated. Well worth the money. We went for a birthday and three hours later, left completely satisfied. They even put hot cider cups in our hands as we left for our taxi!!"

Quince,50,best restaurant in the world,"How did the amazing people at Quince know that the end of our amazing meal would be even better with a warm apple cider for our journey. But they did. Every part of our experience from the greeting, to the plates we ate off, to the extraordinary food we ate stretched our view about what was possible in cuisine.    A special bonus was the rare opportunity to enjoy a course in the kitchen where we could see and hear international quality food being crafted and produced. The kitchen was quiet and the communication clear and the attention to detail - extraordinary. Particularly special was the partnership with a local farm that was reflected in the menu that profiled local produce and the best of California.    Save up for the restaurant experience that will take you to another world of culinary experience!"

Quince,50,Best restaurant in San Francisco,"Read the title. That's it. A formal, delicate and stunning restaurant. A menu elaborated by one of the best, a massive chart of wines to choose from and one of a kind attending. 3 star Michelin with plenty to serve."

Quince,50,Wonderful experience,From the ambience to the dinnerware to the pacing of 10 courses to the service.... everything was outstanding at Quince. Oh and then there’s the wonderful food at this Michelin 3 star restaurant. The presentation of each course was artful and delicious. Particularly loved the black cod... and the invitation to sit at a table in the kitchen for the fifth course to see everyone “in action”.

Quince,50,"Luxury, luxury","To dine at restaurant Quince is to dine in another world; the tasting menu, the american wine menu (especially desired), the service are outstanding. It is expensive, but every dollar worth."

Quince,50,Birthday celebration,"I and my girlfriend decided to celebrate her birthday at Quince last 15th of October. We had the occasion to try diverse 3-star Michelin restaurants around the world so we had high expectations in terms of both quality of the raw material and service and, at the end of the dinner, Quince did not disappoint our expectations.    The location is very nice and welcoming. The service was very precise but not intrusive (an aspect that has to be taken into consideration when the number of personnel is ""consistent"").  Regarding the menu, we remained surprised by two dishes: Garganelli with Maine lobster and Wagyu Sirloin.  The freshness of the ingredients and the astonishing flavors coming out of their combination allowed us to live a very positive culinary experience."

Quince,50,High quality,"I go there with my Mother, it was our first 3 stars restaurant and it was a great experience! All the menu was good, we discover new tastes and we really enjoyed it!! the waiters were really nice! The wine was of course perfect! The little plus is the tisane and the small box of mignardises that they give us when we leave. Go there it’s amazing!"

Quince,30,Very disappointed,Anticipated dining here with longtime friends. I have to say the service was excellent and the ambience as well. The bread is some of the best I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. Those were the highlights. The food honestly was very disappointing. Stinging nettle soup tasted like slimy okra but not as good and then they dropped the smallest oyster in it with great fanfare but it was nothing to elevate the bland soup. Interesting pasta in the shape of snap peas but some were undercooked even if al dente was the goal. The meat entree was excellent but one mouthful at best. Dessert was nice. However $1800 for four people I would rather fly to Paris or New York and have a great dining experience. This was memorable only for how disappointed we were.

Quince,50,"Elegant, Warm Perfection","The cuisine is exceptional. We really enjoyed that the vast majority of the ingredients were local. Since we live here, hearing about a farm in Bolinas, seafood from Santa Barbara, calamari from Monterey, additional produce from Winters, and a wine from Santa Cruz made us feel (even more) at home.    The services is polished and exceptional. We found all of the staff to be warm. It was our 20th anniversary and they did some special things for us, like putting a table in the kitchen and seating us there for our truffles course. On our evening, the food preparation staff alone was about fourteen people, executing with military precision. An impressive operation. On busier nights, we understand that the kitchen crew can approach 20.    The pacing of the meal was spot on. A server asked me how the pacing was while my wife had stepped away and I had him slow things down a tad given that we were there for an anniversary, meaning that we had all the time in the world. It was a thoughtful question and the adjustment was perfect.    I really enjoy interesting plating and this restaurant delivered. In particular, we now are on a hunt to look into Touan ceramics from Kyoto!"

Quince,40,Tasting Delight,"Many have commented on the fixed price tasting menu and the wine pairing. From the commentary (and the tours taken by several in my group) the wine cellar is spectacular but it has a price range to match. You will be hard pushed to find anything <$100.  The tasting menu is expensive and filled with gastronomic delights and plenty of unusual tastes, textures, and combinations. If you elect to try this restaurant you should try everything placed in front of you and get the details from each of the servers who bring the food.  I enjoyed every course and was exposed to tastes and foods I would not ordinarily eat and had thought previously I did not like but found I did. Does it rise to ~$22 /course + tip before adding drinks? Hard to say and a very personal decision but if you decide it is you will not be disappointed in the flavors and experience"

Quince,50,Unbelievable dining experience,"I’m lucky to have a foodie brother who likes to treat, and doesn’t pass out at the idea of a $300 tasting menu, so I’ve gotten to eat some amazing food. Quince was one of the my favorite experiences in fine dining ever! We started with “tomatoes “ that were some kind of molecular magic. Every course to follow was just pure distilled flavor, with a definite focus on local seasonal veggies. I wish I was a food critic, I could do better justice to this food! There was a pasta made into pea pod ravioli with a goat’s milk butter filling, that was sublime. I don’t eat lamb, but I figured if I was going to eat some, it might as well be at Quince, & I wasn’t sorry. The service was attentive and friendly, and even though this is not the kind of restaurant I frequent, I felt welcomed. If you have a special occasion to celebrate, and you love vegetable perfection, you will love this restaurant!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,40,"Excellent Food & Service, But Crowded, Noisy and Overpriced","The Japanese-inspired, very creative, and extremely tasty food along with excellent service are the highlights of a visit to the 3* Single Thread Farm restaurant. Each dish was an explosion of well combined flavors, was fresh, and memorable. It’s hard to pick a favorite from Chef Kyle Connaughton’s culinary tour de force because the courses were such individual culinary treats. The creatively delivered series of amuse-bouche was a great way to start the meal. The wine pairing was inspired (and truly worked well with each dish) and the service both professional and exceptional.    I struggled with the rating but given the excessive cost (over $900 for food, normal wine pairing and service charge/tip) I didn’t feel it was true value for money. Additional the layout of the restaurant gave it an overcrowded vibe with a noise level I’ve never heard in a 3*. The noise at times made it difficult to hear the details about the plate and the wine service.    I’ve done quite a few 3* repeats and there are plenty I’d go back to again, unfortunately this would not be one."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Culinary experience of a lifetime,"Single Thread -not your everyday dining experience. Warning-this is a splurge experience for most.  Our meal involved multiple (double digit) courses all wonderfully presented and prepared perfectly. This is not a ""Meat and Potatoes"" restaurant. My friends would likely be astonished that I ate every morsel which included mostly items I have never tasted before. Every bite was delightful. Many of the pictures already posted on Trip Advisor give you an idea of the presentation and sizes of the courses. While the pictures show the beauty of the presentation; they leave your taste buds dry. The flavors in each item provide a starburst of exquisite joy.  We chose to go with the Reserve Wine Pairing. Alternatives to this choice include a large wine list of individual bottles, the ability to bring your own wine subject to a $150 corkage fee, a regular wine pairing with each course or a non-alcoholic beverage pairing. Given the variety of the multiple courses. it is hard for me to imagine getting the right wine to go with all items unless you choose one of the wine pairing alternatives. The Reserve Pairing included nine different pours each matching fantastically with the menu item.  Service is naturally outstanding. Our table looked directly towards the kitchen so we could observe how many staff were working on our meals and how organized and cooperative all are with each other.  Eating at Single Thread is an Event. Our meal lasted four hours and we truly enjoyed and were entertained each moment while having our epicurean experience.  Reservations are needed and they book beginning two months in advance. Given the length of the meal; having an early reservation works out fine. Ours was for 5 pm."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Worth it,Outrageously priced and worth every penny. I am 40 years old and with some luck I’ll live 40 more. And I sincerely doubt I will ever have a better meal in my life - it is going to be all downhill from here.    The food and service are both incredible. We booked this as a first anniversary splurge and will remember this dinner for the rest of our lives. Incredible experience.

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,30,Excess offsets otherwise outstanding meal,"Review is for restaurant only:    Dined here, two people, fixed 11 course meal with $300 pp wine pairing (their lowest level of 3 pairing choices). Total spent for meal, service and wine: $2000    Pluses:  - Inventive food, not stereotypical French  - Highest quality ingredients  - Beautiful presentation  - Attentive service    Minuses:  - Excessive amount of food. First of 11 courses was itself plentiful— a sushi tower that was amazing but already entrée sized; we felt stuffed halfway through the meal, but the food kept coming  - Wine pairings of erratic quality (ranging from Dom P 2013 to an overly-sweet sake), with unpleasantly generous pours; we were inebriated by the time we finished 4 hours later, and spent the next 24 hours painfully recovering from gluttony and alcohol  - We felt spied-upon by staff from beginning to end, perhaps typical of a 3 star place (as in chef Terry’s place in The Bear)  - Odd pacing on arrival. Escorted to rooftop by elevator but with no explanation as to why… offered a la carte wine by the glass, which is petty given that we were about to drop $2k for the meal    What would have made it perfect:  - Make the meal 5 or 6 courses max  - Pair only with exceptional wines, with modest pours  - Address the smaller specific comments above"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Overall well done,"I must admit I was a bit nervous after reading the most recent reviews on google about the lackluster experiences people were having. I have been to other Michelin star restaurants and I will have to say it did NOT disappoint. It had a Japanese fusion theme, which I was not expecting but pleasantly surprised. I probably would rate it 1-2 stars for the lack of creativity but overall had a wonderful experience with fantastic food. The wine pairings were on point as well. The sommelier was very thorough when explaining each pairing, which I appreciate. I am glad I came hungry because the 11 course meal does definitely fill you up! I would recommend this place if you are going to be in town and looking for a boujee experience. Enjoy!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,20,Well Short of Expectations,"With the great fortune of visiting a dozen three-star restaurants to date, we were excited for our reservation at Single Thread in Healdsburg, CA. Unfortunately, the experience started of poorly with some surprising issues throughout. The morning two days before our reservation, a reminder e-mail was received about our booking. Instead of a positive focus throughout, the content was more akin to a doctor’s appointment reminder almost admonishing guests on a number of items. Understanding there may be space limitations, it would have been nice to receive recommendations on where to go prior to the reservation should the party arrive early instead of a message of “don’t come early, but don’t be late either or else we may start reducing your courses.” The note goes on to say that traffic may make the journey difficult, so it is likely that parties may arrive early, though are clearly not welcome on premises. This was a particularly surprising approach for what has been the most expensive tasting menu to date in my experience, which had to have been pre-paid with gratuities already added (!). Also very disappointing was the sommelier the evening of the booking. Interested in an additional bottle of wine, we asked about some varietals we liked and were either told they were not stocked or were out of stock. Instead of providing recommendations, the sommelier simply brought us the wine list and told us to look and see if there was anything we could find that we wanted. For what is supposed to be the pinnacle of dining experiences, this was far from that. While the food and rest of the table service was very good (with the exception of a lack-luster dessert course which is usually something that stands out), we were finally surprised to see an upcharge for a course we ordered only when the supplemental bill arrived at the end of the evening. Nothing was mentioned about this when offered (the duck vs. wagyu beef which carried the upcharge), no menu was provided (until as a parting gift at the end of the meal) and having already pre-paid the meal, the additional $90 was some insult to injury. Experience 13 was, in our case, unlucky and fell short of expectations on too many levels. Not something we would recommend for the cost vs value received in return."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Loved everything about it!,"We were a party of 6, 4 of them being young adults (20's). They were treated with the same respect and welcoming attitude as anyone else - which often won't happen when young adults are treated to a fine dining event. We started with a non-alcoholic drink in the foyer, before being seated at the most lovely table I've ever seen. All of the items on the table were explained and our sommelier came to help guide our wine selections. He was very personable, as was everyone that served us. I can't begin to remember all of the wonderful bites we experienced. The flavor profiles seemed on point to all of us. It was food we don't customarily eat, but we all are adventurous eaters and enjoyed every morsel. We did the wine pairing (2 at the elevated level and 4 at the regular) I must say - it's a lot of wine and I honestly could not drink the last few glasses that were served with the main courses. The dessert wine (Chateau d'Yquem) could not be appreciated as we were so full and so not able to drink another thing. I would highly recommend this dining experience, but again, it's for adventurous diners, in my opinion. I hope to return - but sometimes things that are so wonderful are best left to memories, often the 2nd time around is not the same. There is only one first time! And Single Thread impressed."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Mind-Blowing Experience!!!,"We were fortunate to experience the food and service excellence at Single Thread in October 2022. The complexity and layers of flavors in each dish were simply amazing. We felt valued by the team, who delivered a flawless execution of Kyle and Katina's vision. It was also very cool to be able to see into the kitchen and observe how focused and calm the team was in crafting innovative creations for us to enjoy. This is an experience we will be talking about for a long, long time. To the chefs, somm, serving staff, and hosts - - well done!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,10,Awful food,If was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Every course was terrible. I personally fid not enjoy even 1 course. We did a 10 course tasting menu but took the last 3 courses to go as one of us literally wanted to vomit.  The wine (which we paid $500 for was also not great. The service was pretty good but the servers constantly changed and you dod not Bond-with anyone. The worst $2300 I have ever spent on 3 people in my life.

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,30,Disappointed. Will be a one and done.,"We wanted to love it. Unfortunately I would have to say we left disappointed. Here are the positives: the restaurant itself is beautiful and the table was extremely inviting and plenty large. Sitting down to a table that is already set with an impressive first course was also a big surprise and a special touch. Here is the not so positive: About half of the tastes in that first course were average - take them or leave them in flavor. And that ended up being about how the evening went. On average, one in three courses I would eat something that was really delicious. The rest of the food was good but not great and overall, the four of us agreed we wouldn’t come back. We also didn’t understand what we were eating because the description was complicated and rushed. I would also like to mention the service. While there was lots of it , and no shortage of attention, it was on the cold side and there wasn’t one person who I would call my wait person. Several people came by to provide the food or clear plates but it wasn’t personal. That meant we didn’t feel that special connection you feel to a restaurant, that only your dedicated wait person can provide.    I hope that this was just a one off evening for Single Thread and that it really is an Amazing 3 Michelin star experience."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,40,Interesting evening,We took our kids here to celebrate as this was a bucket list choice for them. The plating was the most beautiful I have ever experienced even at some similarly priced meals. The welcome was warm and so much fun. However the service was cold and bossy. We were chastised for eating cherry tomatoes on the vine that were part of the plate decor. When we wanted to discuss who was paying for the wine pairing we asked the sommelier to excuse us and return later but she just stood there and watched and listened to the conversation. Our kids swooned over the evening but having eaten at other 3 Micheline Starred restaurants we were underwhelmed with the food as well. There were very few courses that we thought were remotely memorable and mostly memorable for the plating. I gave it 4 stars as it was a median score between the kids and us.

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Above and Beyond Expectations,"We ate dinner with our daughter at Singlethread in early August. We had the full wine pairings. This was our second time dining there. The experience was in complete alignment with their reputation. The level of service and individual attention was a benchmark. It has been several years since I have experienced that level of service and they made it look effortless. While the service was impeccable, you come for the food. Each and every course was delicious and a work of art. The culinary team really know what they are doing and deliver a sensuous and compelling experience. We were enthralled with each course and wondering what could possibly come next. The wine pairings were excellent and truly enhanced each bite. I have had poor experiences with a few small pairing in the past but this was flawless. We are very much looking forward to our next visit and staying on property and experiencing the breakfast and hot pot dinner."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Amazing Experience!!,"My wife and I say that we no longer have WOW dining experiences, but Single Thread was definitely a WOW. From first being greeted at the door and then seeing the table setup to the final glass of wine, the whole experience was amazing. I will say however, that if you don't like Japanese inspired food and presentation, this may not be the restaurant for you."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,20,Underwhelming food and robot-like service,"It’s rare that I have a disappointing meal at a 3-star restaurant, but my dinner at Single Thread was underwhelming.    My overall impression - no passion, no creativity, just a well-oiled mechanism that’s supposed to churn out diners and make money.    Are waiters reading from a script? We had 6 or 7 waiters come and greet us with “so where are you guys visiting us from?”    The Japanese or Japanese-inspired dishes somehow didn’t hit the spot - and I absolutely love Japanese and it’s food… Execution here was poor though…    I had sensational dinners at Manresa (three stars) and Harbor House Inn (got its second star shortly after my visit) which both exceeded expectations. Single Thread was supposed to be the cherry on top during the California trip but turned out to be the weakest point."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,An experience,What an incredible journey through food and wine. Hard to describe but certainly a journey through all kinds of great tastes. We felt at home the entire time starting with a dame of scrabble in the study. The sommelier was great and pairings with tasting good were spot on. Make sure you bring your appetite!!

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,10,Definitely Not Michelin,"Really surprised to see the reviews and definitely not a 3 Michelin star restaurant. We really wanted to like it and were prepared to be blown away but it fell far short of what we expected. I have been to many Michelin restaurants and lived in Tokyo for 6 years and I will never go back to SingleThread. They just tried way too hard and left you really unsatisfied.    What was good  - presentation  - atmosphere  - kitchen    Not good at all  - food way too salty  - shocked they call themselves Japanese, only the plates and chopsticks were Japanese  - cucumber and tomato in everything just because they were ""farm fresh""  - all small bites with no dish that really made you feel satisfied  - even in the desert they had tomato - did not even finish any of the desserts  - staff way too pretentious -- sent us away because we were 10 min early  - instead of Sake pairing they had super heavy win paring    All four of us got sick and called the restaurant the day after, they said it could not be them since no one else complained but that they would ""look into it and call us back"" , of course never called us back."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Perfection,Extraordinary experience. From start to finish the food and service were perfection. I don't want to say anything else to protect your experience of being surprised and delighted as the evening unfolds. Bravo.    I will say I did not enjoy the music in the background. For me it evoked a very low energy massage table vibe that seemed ill-fitted for the experience. But really who am I to question the genius of the team's decisions.

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,5 stars for sure,Excellent meal. Come hungry. Friendly team. Beautiful presentation of food. Definitely earned the 3 Michelin stars!

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,One of our top dining experiences anywhere!,"Simply WOW! We knew we were in for a special experience when we were greeted at the door by a charming host wishing us a happy anniversary - and proceeded to introduce us to everybody in the open kitchen about to lovingly prepare our meal (and yes they do this for all their guests). Each course was complex, unique and most importantly, delicious (thankfully they give you a lovely keepsake menu at the end because the experience was overwhelming). Highly recommend splurging on the wine pairing as well. Reserve early and get ready for the dining experience of a lifetime"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Delightful and Wonderful Respite,"From the moment that we arrived the service by the Inn staff was truly superb, and they went the extra mile to make our wedding anniversary a memorable event. Important touches like a welcome anniversary card to a special anniversary dessert in our room for our celebration that even included another welcome dessert, a charcuterie plate and fresh oysters. The dinner was amazing, very well conceived and executed - a delight for all your 5 senses. The interior is also very soothing and comfortable - minimalist with Japanese sensibility. Our dinner did not include the hot pot, which we were fine with, but included a course with fish smoked in a donabe. The menu mentions 10 courses, but it was much more than that if you consider the first course of a myriad of small bites. Artistry and plating - amazing! The next morning, our custom-made Japanese and Sonoma breakfasts on the roof-top by ourselves in front of the fire was serene, hardy and relaxing. The staff were very attentive even with the stringent Covid-19 measures in place.  Overall, the restaurant staff were professional and amiable, and some of the staff from the open kitchen made us feel welcomed while we waited for our table. The only hiccup was that our room had a Japanese Toto toilet seat that was broken and the controller was not fully functional. You except that everything should be up to snuff if you are paying a premium price for a room. However, it was still a memorable time for us, and would recommend SingleThread without reservations. By-the-way, the Inn sent us an email that the toilet seat has now been replaced in the room."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Always my #1,"There isn't anything I haven't said or written about this fantastic restaurant. No matter if you dine with them on the Kistler Vineyard or now again in the Restaurant again, they wow and exceed your expectation time and time again. Definitely Americas most well deserving 3-Michelin Star Restaurant."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,We stayed at Single Thread,"We stayed at Single Thread Farm inn and had the donabe black cod in-room dining menu on the beautiful rooftop area. It was a fabulous experience! The attention to detail was second to none. The food was incredibly creative and delicious. We had the best sashimi ever! The inn is beautiful in a very understated way. The breakfasts, served in our room, were incredible, very creative, especially the Japanese breakfast which we tried one morning. Michael, the concierge, was very helpful in recommending smaller boutique vineyards to visit, and we made appointments at two that we loved. We have eaten at Michelin 3 star restaurants all over the world, and can say that our meal at Single Thread was one of the most creative we have had. And the meal was not even their multi-course tasting menu! We look forward to returning to try the multi-course tasting menu. We love seeing a chef’s philosophy incorporated into his/ her cooking, and we definitely felt that at a Single Thread. We highly recommend both the inn and the food-a great experience!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,10,A pretentious place,"We closed the roof bar for a family celebration. We were a total of 20 people. It was a very disappointing experience. Waiters were unattentive, food was served without a sigle explanation of what was offered. Wines that we have previously selected were changed without a notice for lower category lables, although the place is cozy and mayby good for cocktails they should not offer full dining service since they are not prepared to do it properly. Price was really abusive. We will never return neither recommend it."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Wow........where do I begin????,"Wow........where do I begin???? The dinner was at the Kistler Vineyard Trenton Roadhouse and it seemed like the setting of a Hollywood romantic movie.  The host greets you and your escorted through the doors of this beautiful country home.  Once you cut across and reach the inside patio, the vision before you is glittering lights strung from one end to another, beautiful plants, trees and vegetation surrounding elegantly dressed tables (with the Covid-19 guidelines).    Every dish was delicately presented and explained. The combination of flavors and ingredients made this night complete. The food was superb!!    The service is on point with your whole experience.    We truly enjoyed this evening and it is one of those experiences that one will never forget."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Incredible food in a gorgeous setting,"SingleThread lives up to its lofty praise and then some. Due to Covid-19, SingleThread decided to move its sit-down dinners to Kistler Vineyards just a bit south of Healdsburg, CA. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous. We got to watch the sunset from their Big Oak tree, and stroll around the property before dinner. There's a beautiful pond just down the hill that you must check out. There's a flowering cactus plant right next to it that produces these brilliantly red fruit.    But enough about the setting (which was gorgeous), let's get to the meal itself. As soon as we rolled up, we were struck by how welcoming the everyone on the staff was. We felt right at home.    Our meal began with a series of amuse bouches served on the front lawn:  1) Fresh apple cider  2) Malted potato  3) Steamed egg custard served in its own egg shell  4) Norwegian king crab    We were then escorted to the back of the vineyard home, where an intimate dining area had been set up. The entire space was lit by lanterns hanging overhead. Beautiful.    Overall, the meal was incredible: a 3-Michelin star Japanese kaiseki dinner fused with California flavors and farm-to-table artistry.    Our meal continued on with a dish they called ""Late Summer in Sonoma"" - a massive spread of assorted sashimi presented on a stunning bed of freshly-picked flowers and moss:  5) Shiso panna cotta with caviar and lemon  6) Tempura nori with avocado  7) Big eye tuna with pepper relish  8) Shima aji with nasturtium and melon  9) Halibut with peach and golden sesame  10) Ebodai with ground cherries  11) Farm crudite with herb emulsion  12) Cod mousse with potatoes  13) Olive oil poached kohlrai  14) Shigoku oysters with pink peppercorn    From there, the dishes just kept coming and coming:  15) Wild kagoshima kanpachi with cucumber and pickled wasabi  16) Aka amadai with eggplant agedashi, negi, and myoga  17) Farm salanova with cured wild salmon, smoked roe, and chive bavarois  18) Summer squash with spot prawn, squash blossom, and prawn head broth  19) Duclair duck with calimyrna fig, turnip, and kanpyo  20) Waygu shortrib with picked ramps, maitake, and beef consomme  21) Albion strawberry with white chocolate, sake kasu, and shiso    The meal concluded with a desert tower containing small bites:  22) Melipona honey ""Yakgwa""  23) Japanese cheescake with umeboshi  24) Suiteki with apriocot  25) Miso custard with asian pear    The meal is paired with a delicious assortment of wines, featuring vintages from Kistler Vineyards (of course)."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Mystical Experience,Food was presented and prepared in and extraordinary manner. Was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food---considering it was a food tasting. My palate senses where pleased at the extreme tastes. INCREDIBLE. Staff was spot-on and very attentive.

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,40,3 star michelin take out,"During the covid stay in place order, single thread, a three star michelin restaurant, has offered daily take out meals on a limited basis. We chose to order a week or so ago- the menu for the evening was based on a homage to Santa Maria Tri-tip and included tossed green salad, garlic bread, pinto beans , tri-tip and strawberry cobbler, It also came with a bottle of Davis winery syrah.    The serving size was for four so the two of us had two evening meals from the package. Price with tip and taxes was about $200.    Food was excellent and ready to serve- they place it in your vehicle. You just need to reserve it, pick it up and take it home and enjoy it.    For those who don't know about Single Thread- check out their website. Normally reservations for in-house eating are tough to get, very pricey and entail a fixed menu you may not know the entrees until you arrive.    So this was our opportunity to say we ate three star michelin restaurant food at a reasonable price. It was also our anniversary!    Highly recommend you take advantage of this opportunity"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Great food! -take out during COVID quarantine.,"During the COVID lockdown we got to do the special take out at single thread. (This was perfect because it was cheaper than their normal prices and we can preview the food to know if we are willing to pay for the full experience). They post their menus a week ahead and you order for the next week. It was $94 for four of us. (Didn’t include the alcohol)  We got a duck hot pot for 4 with sake and wine to go with. It was delicious! It came with a duck salad, the soup and an amazingg little dessert cake, sort of like a spice cake, moist and flavorful!  All the flavors were excellent and it was great to support a local restaurant during these times. Highly recommend their take away during the quarantine time! And I’m sure the on dining experience is fantastic!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,"Excellent, great for gluten-free","Extremely well-run, beautiful food. Presentation was amazing. Only flaws for me were when we arrived we had to wait and there was no place to sit, we had to stand in the foyer - kind of awkward. They did serve us a welcoming tea while we waited. While the food was beautiful and very good, it was not my taste."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Impeccable Service and Honorable Staff,"After the terrible and unethical treatment I experienced with Hotel Healdsburg I was most grateful for the warm, wonderful and honest approach of the staff at the Single Thread Inn. I was traveling on a day that their restaurant was closed. Clearly dining at their world famous restaurant would have been the highlight of my trip. They went out of their way to accommodate me by even recommending other hotels to stay in Healdsburg. Michael was absolutely wonderful and clearly this is an indication of how dedicated they are to customer service. BRAVO SINGLE THREAD INN!!!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,40,Innovative But Not For Everyone!,"Don't try this unless you have great affinity for a Japanese approach to food. The food presentation was amazing and we looked forward to trying each dish - the eye does eat first after all. We (parents plus 2 adult children) were inspired by all dishes but the deserts ranked above for us in terms of ingredient combinations and overall impact. We felt 2 - 3 courses less would have been more but that is us. Service was perfect. Suggestions/downsides: don't take the last seating - eating until midnight is definitely not for everyone either, seating near the entrance in a draft shouldn't happen for the price of this meal so I suggest you ask for a table in the main dining area, no Pilsner on the list and the nearest to it was $ 60.00/bottle and both don't make any sense - I got one compliments of the house when I pointed it out. I'd love to see them pair some of the courses with beers below zero and ice cold sake. Although the wine list is extensive, I suggest you bring your own wines as corkage is reasonable for this level of restaurant. Enjoy!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,The most GORGEOUS meal.,"FLAWLESS.    Where to begin? Being a sucker for Asian influences, I was already swooned with the decor, which is heavily influenced by Japanese design. From the second you enter, the meal begins with a lovely cool tea. Now I have been to restaurants where the entry room is closed off from the main dining area, but in experiences past, it's been nothing more than creating some sort of ""dramatic entrance"". But SingleThread...there is a reason. Once you are escorted to your dining table, the diner is served an expansive array of bites. And I mean EXPANSIVE. A series of fish, oyster, meat and vegetarian bites (9 in all, if I recall correctly). And if the taste of each lovely bite doesn't get you, the presentation will - stunning, absolutely stunning. The first round alone is enough for me to be at ease with price we paid for the meal when we made the reservation.    The entire meal is innovative, yet so familiar and absolutely beautiful. What is most poignant is that courses that would just be viewed as a ""filler"" in other restaurants really are the stars of the menu (i.e., the heirloom tomatoes). And for my teetotaling foodie friends, the restaurant does have a non-alcoholic pairing, which I HIGHLY recommend. All of my drinks paired up perfectly with enhancing all the complex and fresh flavors of each dish. Pure genius.    The kitchen is open for diners to view into throughout the evening, which is always a plus in my book. We were very fortunate to be seated at the table for 4 directly in front, so thoroughly enjoyed watching Chef Connaughton and his team work their magic. So much serenity and calmness as they gracefully moved around each other, right in line with the the overall feel of the evening. The entire experience leaves you in a trance.    I realize that I didn't leave much detail on the food itself...all I can say to that is that the food should be a given at this level of dining. But what SingleThread does to raise the bar is what is worth mentioning. Worth every dollar and I love that I live close enough to experience it again (which I will). Congrats to the entire team for a most memorable meal - every accolade is highly deserved and I have no doubt there is much, much more to come."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,It's the Little Things,"This meal was so incredible, so complex and with so many brand new ingredients for us that it's difficult to know where to begin so I'll focus on details. And not one of them was underappreciated!  THE GARDEN - How appropriate to start the meal in a microcosm of where it all began ~ the farm. We began at sunset on the beautiful rooftop terrace wandering through a small sample of ingredients while enjoying a sip of champagne. FYI, they do not have a liquor licence so prepare to enjoy some fantastic wine!  SERVICE - especially Ricky Gervais and Agent Smith (you know who you are). The front house staff here work seamlessly and with such industry as to make it look effortless as they fulfill every expectation and then go on to surprise and delight. I didn't know that 3-Michelin Stars included guest experience professionals who could read body language (and maybe even lips) to interpret what you wanted before you even knew what that was.Peering for the ladies room? Here comes a chaperone. Drop your fork? Another one appears before you can pick it up.Left handed? Oh, my cutlery somehow ended up on the side I prefer. Unbelievable! Thank you for sharing your expertise and especially for your humour. If food is the blood of this place, you are the breath that gives it life. Some very privileged wine pairings didn't go amiss either!  FOOD - See the pictures to understand the effort, artistry and love that go into every dish. Here were our favourites:  His: 1) Heirloom tomatoes with akabana kanpachi, pickled wasabi and white gazpacho 2) Summer squash with black cod, tamo miso and squash blossoms 3) Saddle of lamb with edamame puree, green olive and garlic scape  Mine: Late Summer in Sonoma (particularly the butter lettuce salad with mock dirt and the panna cotta with caviar) 3) Aka Amadai aka Tilefish with myoga, chard and mandarin.  THE BATHROOMS - Not even sure how all the toilet functions work since I'm not from techland but it was impressive. Just go...even if you don't need to.  DIETARY RESTRICTIONS - No matter what sensitivities or preference you have, they will accommodate it without missing a beat. My dining companion and I have none. Out of curiosity, I asked how the kitchen would cope with an intricate and involved 11 course tasting menu if a large party had vegans, carnivores, gluten-free and lactose intolerant all at the same table. Without hesitation the response was 'No problem'. OMG how? They do like to do know upon booking but EVERYTHING is possible (except McHappy meals). Our server poked at my line of questioning and reluctantly, I admitted not being a huge fan of lamb. Without a request from me, both dishes containing lamb ingredients were substituted for fish ~ So unnecessary but very much appreciated AND one of them ended up being my favourite of the night:-)  PARTING GIFTS - A printed, individualized menu including the actual wines served with each course for EACH person with a handwritten note of thanks, packet of seeds from plants on the farm ribbon-wrapped and embellished with a freshly-picked herb bouquet. Gratitude to you right back.  The price is not for the faint of heart but we will talk about this dinner for the rest of our lives ~ Loved every minute!"

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,50,Beyond Amazing,"The best way to sum up Single Thread is - ""wow!"" Find an excuse to dine here. If you can't come up with one, go anyway. For us, it was our 20th wedding anniversary. My husband and I enjoy restaurants with tasting menus. At the level Single Thread is orbiting in, all such restaurants have amazing food and presentation. What set Single Thread apart for us was the service. From the moment we stepped in the door to the moment we walked back out again, we were met by friendly, gracious staff who seemed intent on delighting us, both in obvious and not so obvious ways. For example, they observed that I was left handed and without my noticing (until I noticed later) they shifted my place setting to a left-handed orientation. I won't spoil the many other ways in which we were ""delighted,"" as the surprise of it all was part of what made the experience so memorable. If you go, make sure to spend time on the rooftop bar, either before or after dinner."

SingleThread Farm Restaurant,30,we really hoped for much more,if you like raw fish ...this 3 star is for you ! i do not eat fish ....and told them so multiple times ....when we arrived at the after a champagne toast on the deck ...there was an outstanding arrangement of raw fish in front of my seat...  the meal was not worth the price ....sorry we will not be back

Per Se,30,Poor management,"I had a 5 o’clock table for four at the lounge. This is the second time this manager short abrupt Spanish person spoke to me, inappropriately abruptly and arrogantly, and I’ll tell you who it was it. It was not Stephen I don’t know the managers name, but this is the second time this gentleman is giving me a hard time, and I’ve been to a restaurant on many occasions, and he was well aware of that."

Per Se,20,"Amazingly average, echos what the NY Times Critique.","I paid over $2,000 for the “upgraded menu”. Yes you heard right, over $2k for my wife and I. I heard Per Se received a negative review, and Chef Keller took it seriously and personally coached all the staff. Yet my experience echos the recent criticism.    First, most courses are so salty, I'm surprised Per Se is not hosting its own oceanic ecosystem. It's like the chef accidentally sneezed while seasoning and mistook the salt for confetti.    Secondly, the flavor is average - I was eating and waiting for the “wow” moment that never came. I went to many Michelin starred restaurants. I vividly remember the amazing teas at Oriole, the Arctic Char and the Netflix show worthy dessert presentation from Alinea, and the astonishing Uni Egg with Caviar at Providence. Yet, it’s only been three months since I dined at Per Se and don’t recall any dishes, especially for a $2000 meal.    Third, the service isn’t Michelin star worthy. It's like the staff attended a seminar on 'How to Be Inoffensively Blah.' There was no smile from anyone, even as I smiled at them and tried to be as polite as I could. Maybe this is just a New Yorker thing, or maybe they don’t think I belong there by the way I dress. Either way, I think Warren Buffet would not have a good time there (because he certainly doesn’t drive a fancy car or wear Gucci).    Hey Michelin Guide, do us all a favor and please, please, please reevaluate the Stars this restaurant deserves."

Per Se,50,Astonishingly good,"The entire experience was absolutely divine. As someone that dines by themselves fairly often, and has had a handful of unpleasant dinners as a result, this was the exact opposite.    Everyone at the restaurant made me feel extremely welcome, because they know that someone dining alone really does appreciate food. And, in return, their attention to detail (both in terms of hospitality and the food itself) was appreciated.    Even the extra little dishes they provided that were not on the menu were exceptionally good. And the chocolates, despite being so simple, were the best chocolates I've ever had - they were almost worth the expense of the dinner by themselves!    The price means it's obviously not an everyday occasion, but I will definitely be going back when I get the chance."

Per Se,50,Wonderful,"We loved Per Se. We had the tasting menu and wanted the paired wines but knew we wouldn't be able to drink them all. The sommelier was nice enough to provide us a reduced set of wines for the price of just one normal pairing and we loved what we were served.    The food was a wonderland of tastes, beautifully prepared, creative but not weird, and absolutely delicious. If cost is an issue, that probably puts too much pressure on the meal and then people are super-critical. But we just loved it.    The staff were fun as well, with lots of personality. We really enjoyed them.    We also loved that the seating is such that no one has to look at a wall. Many an expensive dinner has been ruined elsewhere by looking at walls.    Next time we're in NYC we will do it again."

Per Se,30,Disappointing!!,"This restaurant is great for tourists. This restaurant is NOT good for someone who understands good food. I've eaten at 11 Madison, Piaza Duomo, BlueHill at Stone Barn, and Alinea. Per Se doesn't even come close !!!    SERVICE:  The servers are friendly but not trained well enough to serve in a fine establishment.  Even the plates didn't match for the same dish served to all the guests - did they not have enough marching plates?  Server's communication was not clear    FOOD:  No plate cleaners were offered between meals.  The fried dishes were very oily.  Nothing really memorable or very creative was served.    Overall- extremely disappointing- what a pitty.    Michelin - stop the madness!"

Per Se,10,Tragedy of American high-end restaurant gourmet food,"Had a birthday party there recently. The hors d’oeuvres were ok as far as hors d’oeuvres went, I would rate them to be average, or 3/5. They included Wagyu beef, etc., good materials but below average cooking method.    But the main dishes were absolutely horrible, not palatable at all. Here is a summary of the problems were:  1. All the main dishes, including Salmen, chicken & lam were cold. Those were all sous vide cooked many hours prior to serving. The staff did not even bother to heat them up. I was expecting some sauté dishes with Maillard reaction, but no, all served were cold and unpalatable dishes.    2. All food is absolutely bland. Except for some salt, there was no seasoning, spice, or aroma of any kind. The food simply gagged me.    3. I do not know the price our party host paid, but from reviews of similar prefix menu there, I know it would be in excess of $1,000 per person.    The wines served on the other hand were excellent, the best i had in a long while."

Per Se,50,Good,"Per Se is, without question, an incomparable culinary experience that lacks an equal. As you enter the sleek and classic dining room overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park, you feel like you're simultaneously transported to the classic supper clubs of the 40's, without losing the substance, complexity, and modernity of today's greatest bakers and chefs."

Per Se,40,Fine dining experience,"I booked Per Se, and then my flight and hotel. It was a fine dining experience. For a Michelin 3-Star restaurant, the food was very good but not exceptional. The only dish that impressed me the most was the green circle Amish chicken – very original, creative, and flavorful. The variety of desserts was unexpected – they were wonderful! In addition to the 9-course meal of $390 pp, they offered other dishes ranging from $40 to $130. The staff was attentive and friendly. We were lucky Chef Thomas Keller was on site. He came out to greet the guests, and we took a picture with him."

Per Se,50,Absolutely the best meal we've had all year! (Even for Celiac disease folks),"What can I say? Celiac heaven! The staff were so understanding for our 2 with Celiac (and very sensitive to contamination). We had the 9 course tasting menu and the 2 with Celiac had a slightly modified menu. We all LOVED it and no contamination! A beautiful night of absolutely delicious GF food. Absolutely worth the money!  Hint: If time allows, you can ask for a tour of the kitchen....a treat to see!"

Per Se,40,"Still worth the visit, in my opinion!","Per Se is an iconic New York restaurant by The French Laundry’s chef, Thomas Keller. It doesn’t disappoint: the appetizers, cheeses and desserts from the tasting menu are some of the best food we’ve ever had in New York. I’d highlight the impeccable oysters with caviar, the tomato and heart of palm salad, the cheese pastry with truffles, the chocolate chai pudding, and the cappuccino ice cream. The view from the tables is gorgeous. Service is also top notch and delightfully friendly (feels like you’re not on Manhattan - chuckles).    We just weren’t as impressed with the meat dishes - the crab pierogi was good, but not mouth-dropping; the chicken was the best of the three, but still not awe inspiring; and the lamb prime rib tasted blander and less tender than we hoped.    I’m giving 4/5 stars only because, when you pay this high a price for a meal, my expectations are that every step of it will be moving and memorable. This was the case with a good part of the menu, but far from all of it."

Per Se,30,Beauty & The Beast,"Without doubt, the best meal I have ever had (& I’ve been lucky to dine in some of the best restaurants in the world).    Brilliant ingredients, perfectly cooked, impeccably served by a wonderful front of house team.    It’s expensive but more than worth it if you can afford it.    But…as I was basking in the afterglow of the finest culinary experience I’ve ever had, I was brought back to earth with a bump when I turned my attention to the check.    So confused have I become by New York’s baffling array of new tipping protocols I called Per Se prior to attending to ensure I had correctly understood their concept of “Service included”. “Service is included” I was assured.    Yet, at the end of the meal - CLUNK!! There it was in black and white on the credit card slip, “Service included” it yelped, but then added a snarling, stage-whispered, “Optional Gratuity” prompt. It was all wrapped up in a leather wallet and handed to me by the delightful waitress who had charmed us throughout the meal.    What the heck is one supposed to do? I wasn’t alone in my dismay, the gentleman on the table beside us asked the waitress “what’s with this extra gratuity thing? I thought it was service included?”.    “We’re paid an hourly rate…” she started…but the deafening clunky clattering of an embarrassed, confused and bemused customer drowned out whatever she said next.    “It’s my new favourite restaurant” he said, “but…this is all a bit weird”.    I felt similarly. A place like this doesn’t need to humiliate its customers in this way.    Yes, most of their clientele will either be filthy rich enough to throw down a few hundred extra dollars without batting an eyelid or not give a fig about leaving nothing.    This gauche, grubby hand-held-out, last ditch effort to extract who knows how many hundreds of dollars more - should surely be below an establishment of this class. Yet it stoops that low, turning the cheapest of tricks.    The only people bothered by this revolting practise are those who can just about afford this brief foray into the world of luxury dining. They will either be shamefully bullied into leaving an extra one or two hundred dollars they can ill afford, or left feeling somewhat shabby and embarrassed by their decision not to.    I was aiming to make another visit next month when I’m back in New York, pushing the boat out again, but it’s clear that this restaurant would rather gorge itself on clientele with deeper pockets than mine.    It’s not gauche per se, yet it’s certainly on the cusp of being so when it comes to an unnecessarily (un)happy ending.    In spite of the fabulous food, I left with a bad taste in my mouth."

Per Se,50,"Fantastic dinner, perhaps my new favorite in NYC","Our dinner last Wed night at 3* Per Se was phenomenal. I’d always avoided dining here due to the ridiculous jacket requirement (that’s now only recommended) and after a good but otherwise unremarkable dinner at French Laundry many years ago.    To say this was a vast improvement is an understatement. Per Se hit it out of the park for me. Everything was stellar. The food was sublime. I even loved the signature oyster and pearls — even as I’m not fond of oysters. The foie gras add on was delish. The black truffle add on for the risotto must have been the most generous truffle servings I’ve ever seen anywhere; they returned for a second helping of truffles without being asked and dropped enough each time to make me literally salivate. Every course was incredible, and all of the wine pairings were inspired and outstanding.    Service was polished and formal — but definitely relaxed once I got them going. We joked around with the team and had a good time of it. That’s a big plus for me to avoid the stodgy atmosphere that too often can accompany more stars.    I’d return in a heartbeat."

Per Se,30,Most of the food was tasty,"though, a dish or two were too sweet. But, I have to say this, be prepared to be hungry when you get home. Their 'duck breast' entree on the menu was literally the width of a strip of bacon... I could have eaten it in one bite. Luckily, it was on a vendor's bill."

Per Se,50,Fantastic …,"Although I would still prefer the less New York style and vibe of the French Laundry in Napa, this place again creates an outstanding food experience very few in this world can create. Every dish of the pre-set menu is unique and another fantastic experience. A beautiful evening … supported by excellent staff … and of course great wines. Just SUPER."

Per Se,50,One of the best experiences,"Had a wonderful evening here with friends. It was simply amazing! The food, the atmosphere and the service were outstanding."

Per Se,50,Perfect,"Service and food were as great as we have ever experienced. So elegant. Staff did a fantastic job. We were given the couch in the lounge, which we thought was the best table in the house. Saw day turn into NYC evening. Will never forget it. My wife looked so beautiful."

Per Se,50,Top restaurant worldwide,"Per Se is my favourite restaurant in the world ex aequo with Carlo Cracco restaurant in Milan. Location is wonderful. Service excellent. Menu outstanding. Someone can think prices are too high for a dinner. This is a mistake. Prices are fair for such a menu of masterworks. At least once in the entire life, everyone should go for dinner at Per Se."

Per Se,20,"Great view, food not so great",Nothing was delicious. Nothing was bad. The taste of the food is not up to the standards of a gourmet restaurant. The wine paring serves predominantly well chosen sub $100 wines (some $30 bottles are served) with the exception of the champagne

Per Se,40,A Little Disappointed….,"Being a foodie, I have wanted to try Per Se for a long time. Had dinner there tonight and have to say I was a bit disappointed. The food was very good, but the service left a bit to be desired. For the number of staff running around, you should not have to ask for refills on water or for another cocktail. It happened more than once throughout the evening.    For being rated a Michelin 3, the expectation is high and Per Se missed the mark. It also felt a bit rushed. I’m glad I marked it off the list, but not sure I would go again."

Per Se,50,An evening never to forget,"Per Se has been on our bucket list for many years now.  Now was the time to try their Evolution Menu at 850 USD.  For that price it better be good.  Good was not the word ... fantastic is a better word.  Everything was just perfect.  Food, wine and service could not have been any better.  Looking forward to come back another time :-)"

Per Se,10,"Very disappointing experience, very average cuisine for a ridiculous price.","The food was fine but extremely overpriced, with zero special details, surprises or extra effort which is a must for a 3 michelin star restaurant. Very mediocre cuisine for 3000 usd for a table of 4persons. Extremely disappointing."

Per Se,50,Outstanding experience,"Food wise, Being Peruvian is hard to please and very hard ti impress.  We have been to French Laundry several times but I have to day that Mr Keller does a fantastic job here too. The restaurant us cozy and elegant with a beautifull view if Columbus circle. If you really want to treat yourself and enjoy do the dining room and not the salon (which feels more like a bar set up and not a real restaurant).  Everybody is very corteous and unlike past experiences at the French Laundry, very flexible with food. They make you feel really pampered. The food is really a culinary experience and even ingredients that are not your favorites turn up so pleasant and interesting.  All dishes were great but i will have to say that the bread (although fantastic) bus off being served in the middle if the meal. Also the pasing is a ""little slow"".  We were attended by the Maitre D"

Per Se,50,A dream culinary NYC experience,"A US/NYC culinary Michelin star establishment. Per Se is a superb 3 Michelin star restaurant. Jaw dropping views, brilliant thoughtful service, delicious food and first rate and surprisingly value for money wine list. Worth the splurge."

Per Se,50,Complete perfection,"My husband and I were celebrating his promotion and this was the perfect evening. The food was divine and service impeccable. We cannot fault it, from the moment we entered the restaurant to the moment we left. It is very clear why this place is rated so highly. If you ever get the chance to visit please take it."

Per Se,50,Great Food and Views,"There are few tables next to window, those are definitely the best tables with views of midtown. This is a fancy place so I would wear a jacket unless you want to stand out in a bad way. The service is quite formal and professional. The food is what you would expect in a 3-Michelin star tasting menu. It didn't really knock my socks off but I'm thinking because ingredients are harder to get after a pandemic. Supply chain issues, but that's my theory since most restaurants I used to like are just not as good now. The guy in charge is very down to earth which is a change of pace from the other formal servers. I'm not sure if I come back because it's too formal here and I like to dress down with hoody, cap, and Jordans."

Per Se,30,Not a 3-star experience,"Having done some 3* Michelin restaurants, this was the poorest experience: 30min before we got a drink, cold atmosphere no music, no amuses-bouche, no bread nor other.  8 courses, too small portions without taking any taste/flavor risk. The 3 first courses were very buttery/greasy. Could produce this at home. No explanation about wines nor food. Service was average but very far from a 3-star experience.  Not worth 1000$ for 2!"

Per Se,50,A delightfully orchestrated experience,"I could not wish for a better celebration of my birthday. The experience fully lived up to the expectation in smallest detail. From the food which was a divinely crafted composition, through wine pairing, that elevated the experience even further, to the service that was just perfect. I felt grateful to be alive and able to enjoy the moment I will truly never forget. Thank you"

Per Se,50,Superb experience,"What a setting to enjoy post-Covid lockdown! Classy decor, very professional and at the same time friendly service (funny sommelier!), unforgettable food services with researched ingredients, selection of wines to die for. Thanks to all the team for such wonderful evening!"

Per Se,50,Excellent Meal,"We dined here just before Thanksgiving 2021, and the meal was outstanding. We didn't mind the upselling at the beginning, and the white truffle was well worth it anyway. The staff was very attentive, and the food was excellent. There was even a brief kitchen tour at the end where we saw Chef Keller on CCTV from the French Laundry. We will definitely return and are considering turning it into an annual holiday tradition."

Per Se,50,Absolutely Wonderful,"Just an incredible experience. Décor is simply gorgeous, service is just the best. And the food is to die for. Beautifully presented, and a wonderful range of tastes. Great views of Central Park, and definitely worth the splurge."

Per Se,10,“Are we at Applebee’s or are we at Per Se?” Buyer Beware,"""Are we at Per Se or are we at Applebee's?"" This was the question on our minds as we ate dinner. Buyer beware - do not come to Per Se if you are expecting a refined and elegant dining experience. Per Se has no expected standards of attire and behavior being enforced confirmed by its own maitre d Alex Pimentel. This failure of the purported three Michelin star institution greatly reduced the quality and enjoyment of our experience and was far below what we have experienced in the past at Per Se or other three Michelin star restaurants.    One table in our direct view had two very old men with two teenaged-looking girls. One girl was wearing sweatpants, a crop top, and flip flops. The other girl was wearing a sweatshirt and sneakers. One of the old men had a little black puppy with him and Per Se allowed the puppy to run around the floor of the dining room throughout the dinner. Another table next to us was obnoxiously loud throughout the evening, taking over the space and taking away from everyone else's enjoyment.    It was clear from the circus around us that Per Se has no standards for guest attire or behavior and does not care about guest experience at all. When I wrote to the restaurant after our dinner to share our feedback, the maitre d Alex Pimentel asked me to call him to talk. After playing phone tag a couple times, we were finally able to connect. Alex began the phone conversation by flippantly stating ""I understand you had a problem with some guests who weren't dressed as nicely as you would have liked?"" Wow. This is the guy they put in charge of guest relations? What a great attitude for the job. Alex ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time by making up excuses for every single aspect of our underwhelming dining experience. According to Alex:    1) Per Se does not have a dress code for women, only for men. Women can apparently dine in a string bikini and flip flops. Alex says: ""Per Se gets people from all walks of life and unfortunately we really only enforce a dress code for men.""    2) Alex said the old men were hotel guests and that they were dining with their ""nieces or daughters."" I told him that we could not care less where the old men were lodging or the nature of their relationship with the teenaged girls, but that the young women should at the very least not be wearing sweatpants, crop tops, flip flops, sweatshirts, and sneakers. Alex once again reiterated that there is no dress code for women.    3) Alex could not come up with an excuse for the puppy running around.    4) Alex said that if we were disappointed at any point in the evening with our experience, the burden was on us to try to create the experience we want. Alex said we should have complained about the other guests (all seated within earshot) and we may have been reseated space permitting. So a three Michelin star restaurant is putting the onus on its guests to create a fine dining experience. Why would it be on guests to make sure Per Se enforces basic standards of attire and behavior of other guests? When Per Se allows a circus in its dining room, Per Se is not going after a three Michelin star experience. When the maitre d tells guests that it is actually their burden and responsibility to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience, there is something terribly wrong with the training and culture at Per Se.    5) Food: lobster was extremely chewy like bubblegum. The chicken was bland and a bit rubbery. Loved the crispy skin on the bass. Lamb was just lamb, but on the tougher side. The wagyu was unremarkable. Black truffle pasta was delicious with a generous shaving of truffles.    6) Service: star is for Maris who was fantastic and we appreciated her excellent service and professionalism. Maris seemed to be the only one we encountered at Per Se who was aware that the restaurant is supposed to provide a three Michelin star experience. The wine pairing was $350 and the sommelier was perfunctory and inattentive.    Alex concluded our phone conversation with an underwhelming, ""well in the future please reach out to me to coordinate your next visit to Per Se."" He didn't even offer a genuine apology without excuses or any gesture of good will from the restaurant.    Will we be coming back to Per Se after this experience and Alex's response to our feedback? As Randy Jackson once eloquently stated, ""Yeah that's gonna be a no from me, dawg."""

Les Amis,20,"What a disappointment. Incompetent service, boring menu, bland food.","Yes it was one of the ""original"" fine dining places in SG with a stellar reputation, but judging from my recent experience it is now a sad shadow of whatever its former glories were. Arrived, got a polite but somewhat standard/perfunctory welcome from the maitre d (who never interacted with us again for the whole evening). Servers were Ok but you could tell they were reciting a memorised script of a standard meet and greet. They were pleasant enough but not polished (eg neglecting to refill my water throughout, wrong utensil settings for the next course, etc). The young chap who was dressed as the sommelier did not offer me the wine list, even after I made eye contact with him whilst waiting for the course to start. I thought maybe he would come after the amuse bouche, but still no. My first proper course arrived and still no wine. I asked my waiter for the wine list. She got it (surely the sommelier should have stepped in at this point). I ordered a glass. She had no idea...rummaged around the wine fridge, couldn't sort it out. Went to ask for help. The ""sommelier"" finally got involved, found the bottle but it was empty or something, took ages to find another bottle and prep it. Finally came over, poured it, but no comment (let alone a polite ""sorry"") at all for the delay. After this debacle one would expect some better service - nope, no one came again to offer me a red for my meat course let alone dessert wines. As to the food, the menu choices were very standard (which is fine, if done well). However, many of the appetizers (both cold and warm ) were served with big dollops of caviar which to me is just a lazy way to mask the inherently unimaginative and boring cooking. The underlying ingredients themselves tasted bland, the sauces one dimensional. Same with the main courses - bland, boring, standard fare one could get in any big hotel formal restaurant. The Les Amis team might want to go to Zen or Odette (to name a few) and see how true fine dining should be done nowadays."

Les Amis,50,The degustian menu is excellent,We visit last week and during lunch time. The food was excellent . Everything is good and the service is top notch . Kudos to the team!

Les Amis,50,Absolutely impeccable and incredible,"An absolutely impeccable, dining experience! The service, the wine list, the cocktails reflect the best standard of hospitality.    The four course meal that we had embodied the pinnacle of perfection. Rarely am I taken by a Michelin three star restaurant here I was.    The meal also included several additional bites. Each one was divine!    I work in the food and beverage space and all I can say is you should visit this restaurant. Bravo!"

Les Amis,30,"Food’s good overall with some hits and misses, service could be better - an incomplete dining experience for the price","Some good dishes, particularly the soup and duck breast. Other dishes were just OK. Valet not there when we drove up and vanished by the time we finished. We’d left our cashcard at home and had to walk around Scott’s Rd getting a new one when a full service restaurant would have perhaps facilitated the parking coupon. Odd location with people walking by the main door and looking in, traffic noise. Have eaten at Joel Robuchon and other restaurants here and overseas and found the service is warmer, more polite and welcoming elsewhere. There is better food available for less and minus the attitude."

Les Amis,50,Perfect French Lunch in Singapore,"Many thanks to Leonel Patrick Esteves, ""Premier Maitre D'Hotel"" at this amazing location which transports you from the luxury shopping district in Singapore directly to France. Every item is perfect, every service is provided. I ordered the 3 course lunch, which is of course more like 5 courses...ingredients from France exquisitely explained and delivered. Though you shouldn't drive home after, the wine pairing was absolutely inspirational and many thanks to the master Sommelier, Herve Pennequin for that. Very thankful I chose this experience."

Les Amis,50,Absolutely perfect,"Tasting menu with wine pairing was exceptional. The staff was efficient, knowledgeable, and very kind. Food was perfect."

Les Amis,40,Standard Michelin Fine Diner,"As mentioned in the review for Zen Restaurant, we prefer the more contemporary restaurant that the World’s 50 Best tend to favour rather than the more traditional that Michelin like.    Les Amis is certainly more traditional, but there was a lot to like. It’s also quite apparent from the website and reviews that this is the experience you’ll get, so we went in eyes wide open.    Think pressed to within an inch of their life white tablecloths, hushed atmosphere, tables very spaced. Everything quite formal.    With that said we think the best part of the night was the service. All very lovely and quite fun. Cultivated, but with a twinkle in the eye. Serious, but not taking themselves seriously. It was fun.    We did the truffle degustation, which was good but indulged a pet gate of hours namely that the truffle is more an afterthought. Same dishes as rest of the menu, but with truffle shaved onto them rather than incorporate it more into the dish.    Quite a show made over the bread, cheese course, and ice cream! All very good and enjoyable piece of theatre.    Looked after right till the end with one of the members of service coming out and waiting with us for the taxi.    Lots to like, just not quite what we’re looking for in a fine diner but plenty of others will love."

Les Amis,50,Perfection,"We come here three or four times a year and the meal we had last week was in my opinion the best ever. Everything was perfect from start to finish, even the amuse bouches were incredible. The quality of wines and digestifs were also outstanding. How lucky we are to be able to dine here!"

Les Amis,50,Legit with a few small misses,"We’ve been here many times and another great dinner tonight. We had the classic menu and every dish was very good to great. Something missing from tonight though - chef didn’t say hi, the staff not too interactive, staff forgot to give drink list. Little things, but if done well, even better"

Les Amis,50,Spectacular lunch in Singapore!,Absolutely amazing lunch - food as beautiful as it was delicious! Impeccable service. Worth every Michellin star! A must do for every foodie!!

Les Amis,30,Unimaginative,"Came for birthday lunch. Nearly everything had an overdose of caviar which seemed like a lazy way of justifying prices. I had a dirty spoon come with my dessert and I scraped off the scum with my fingernail to show the waiter. Not fine dining behaviour for sure, but what’s the point of arranging food in delicate detail and serving it with a dirty spoon. It also took some time to get servers’ attention to get the spoon replaced. The gold foil and caviar can’t mask the lack of inspiration. Not reaching my expectation of a gastronomic experience."

Les Amis,50,Definitely Worth Making Trip For,"I came here via bus on a rainy Monday afternoon in early December 2022. The entire meal took a little longer than 2 hours because I asked for plenty of breaks as I was getting really full towards the end of the meal. It didn't help that whenever I was running low of anything, they'd offer me more of it to go with the rest of the dish (e.g., mini croissants for the caviar or more ice cream for the souffle). Needless to say, their service was impeccable, they were so attentive all the while providing a lot of privacy, which can be a difficult balance.    I had made my reservation four days beforehand for the afternoon because it was the only time I had free on my itinerary. I didn't feel like the time I had the meal took away from any of it. It was the best meal I had in Singapore and you can definitely see why this place has three Michelin Stars.    I got the four-course option and picked with dish I wanted to try from each of the four categories: cold appetizers; hot appetizers; main course; and dessert. I paid an extra $20 to include the Crab with Cavier for the cold appetizer. Everything they put in front of me was exquisite and flavorful.    At the end of the meal, they did not charge me for the hot tea but the bottle of water I had was $18. They even printed out a copy of the meal I ordered and gifted me the jelly candy they made. They recommended that the candies should be enjoyed within a couple of days. Definitely worth making a trip for."

Les Amis,40,Good yet something was missing,"Two of us had the degustation menu with some wine pairing with specific meals. Overall, the food was good and portions larger than I have had in any other 2-3 star restaurant. I can't argue that the cooking was excellent, and standouts were the duck. But it lacked magic that I have experienced at other 2 (and even 1) star establishments. The plating was presentable but not meticulous or in any way magical. Almost rustic. The service was generally good although clumsy at times and not faultless. I hate to say but compared to Zen, which carries you along on an amazing journey, Les Amis seems dated but without the kudos of being timeless. Cloud Street and JAAN were more impressive, not as costly and carried a better service. Zen remains the best 3* in Singapore by a country mile."

Les Amis,20,One totally overrated Restaurant,"We arrived 18:55. They let us wait outside until sharp 19:00 when they unlocked the door.  The bread variety was excellent, so was the starter. The seabass was overcooked, the Wagyu okay. Taste of vegetables below average.  Food and Staff never matched 3 Michelin stars.  Totally overpriced. Very disappointed."

Les Amis,50,Best French restaurant in Singapore,"I used to visit this restaurant every year when traveling to the beautiful city of Singapore. This time visit was four years after the Covid. Food and services are excellent as always. Good that I booked months ago for lunch, otherwise it is fully booked. Enjoying the drinks and food and desserts, will definitely return in my next visit."

Les Amis,40,Yes it was good,"Nice location and setting, the food was also good and the service. Everything was basically good and yet I somehow missed the ultimate experience that a 3 star Michelin restaurant ought to be. Good indeed"

Les Amis,50,"Excellent food, excellent service. By far our favorite restaurant on our 18 day trip!","My partner and I, along with another couple from Dallas, recently visited Singapore, Koh Samui and Bangkok in July 2022. During our trip, we were lucky to try some delicious food at some top rated restaurants, including (in order of dining) Labyrinth, ART, Les Amis, Chatterbox, Jahn at the Conrad Koh Samui, Le Du, Vertigo, Methavalai Sorndaeng, and the Front Room. We all agreed that Les Amis is by far our favorite from our recent trip!    The amazing service from this Michelin 3 star (and #23 on Asia's 50 Best Restaurant list) started months before we arrived! I reached out via email to ask some questions, and Natalie always responded quickly and professionally. I had inquired about bringing a bottle of our 2012 Cakebread Dancing Bear Ranch Cab, to see if it would pair well with the tasting menu. Natalie, recognizing that we enjoyed wines, offered our group the opportunity to dine in the newly renovated Magnum Room -- which was beautiful! It was very very nice to dine in the Magnum Room and we highly recommend it! In the end, the chief sommelier, Eric, contacted me and told me the Cakebread DBR would be too powerful for our meal, so we ended up bringing a bottle of 2014 Rhys Pinot Noir. Because we have a decent collection of wines at home, we really appreciated Les Amis's corkage policy. Since we ordered a bottle of champagne that was more than $200SD, the restaurant waived the $150SD corkage fee! Since we were bringing the Rhys Pinot Noir, Eric recommended a bottle of Champagne Pierre Gerbais ""L'Originale"", and because the restaurant had a limited supply, he made sure to hold one for us. Yes, all this before we even arrived!    The excellent / amazing service continued throughout our meal. The food (please see the pictures) was amazing! The standout to me was the duck!    Yes, it's quite a splurge, but totally worth it! The restaurant is worthy of it's ratings!"

Les Amis,50,Legendary Les Amis,"Been here many times and each time excellent and 3 michelin star worthy Each dish was exquisite and tasty. As expected, they go all out with the bread selection, amuse bouche, petit fours etc Service is down to earth and equally good"

Les Amis,50,Speechless,"Amazing meal at Les Amis, high level of 3 Michelin star.  Food was incredible, wild turbot perfectly cooked, wagyu beef served with a fantastic sauce. Dessert was sublime, well balanced between strawberry and sugar.  Large wine list and impeccable service.  Beautiful moment !"

Les Amis,50,Well Deserved Michelin,"Perfect 3 Star Michelin, fully well deserved  This restaurant has 3 type of course to choose from where the first course you can pick your own appetizer main course and dessert. This is perfect for people who knows what they would like to eat so they can choose their own preferences! Another two course is a fixed menu for people who doesnt like to choose    Crab caviar, sea urchin, duck is PERFECT  The bread selection is so soft, exactly like those in france! definitely try the little croissant  Signature lamb is must try as well! Dont miss it    To sum up, its a definite must try restaurant for fine dining lover!"

Les Amis,50,As good as it gets,"Haven’t been allowed out of Australia for a couple of years now and when released one of the first restaurants we went to was Les Amis. We have been several times and it remains one or our favourite restaurants in Singapore. Not only was the service perfect, the elder gentleman that served us showed genuine warmth and hospitality. Needless to say for a 3 star the food was impeccable, if I had to criticise anything the presentation of the crab looked a little like tinned tuna, and I would have enjoyed more than 2 amuse bouche, but we can’t all be El Celler! The ice cream service was a treat!"

Les Amis,50,Pricey but worthy of the experience,"We randomly picked this restaurant not realising that it is in fact a 3 Michelin stars restaurant, and of course we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, wine and service.    Instead of going for the degustation menu, we opted for la carte and tried the following:    - Warm lobster mousse wrapped in baby spinach served with classic fish bone sauce  - Roasted white asparagus from Provence with bitter spring shoots & Choron sauce  - Roasted Challans duck breast from Vendée accompanied by glazed spring turnips  - Roasted wild turbot from the port of Île d'Yeu with Printanière sauce  - Layers of Gariguette strawberries & meringue in a crisp sugar sphere  - Fine selection of farmhouse & artisanal french cheeses from Mons    While everything was delicious, the spinach wrapped lobster, and roasted white asparagus were beyond amazing, so was the strawberries meringue - these are must try.    Ambience-wise, despite being a fine-dining restaurant, it has a dining room setting which allows interaction between tables. If one is looking for a more private intimate setting, m upstairs seating might be better suited."

Les Amis,50,Our 8 th Wedding Anniversary unforgettable lunch,"We are a couple from Hong Kong and have chosen this restaurant for our event at this restaurant!  Perfect! The food, service and the atmosphere proved that we were absolutely right for our decision. The words on the plates and that big pearl surprised us! Thank everybody of Les Amis!"

Les Amis,30,Less said the better,Having visited many michelin restaurants in Europe and the America's I would rate the experience as very underwhelming. Both decor and food were matter of fact. The ingredients used were sure world class and excellent but somehow the final product did not match up. Service was to match and the price was way to much for the entire experience. Very disappointed.

Les Amis,30,Disappointing,"The Turbot that came with the set menu was smelling so bad it made my stomach churn. There were several dishes that tasted so ordinary. Of course I understand they are made from the finest ingredients. Some dishes like the asparagus and lamb were mind blowing to be honest.  The girl who served us had an attitude, luckily she left in the middle of the service. I believe you can never put a price on creativity. But there is simply no justification for the price charged. If you have dined in a Michelin 3 star in Europe, you will understand what I mean."

Les Amis,50,Best fine dining in SGP,"Since many years a great place, great food, excellent service and wounderful wine list - like the Renovated chef table room."

Les Amis,50,Great start to 2022,"Wanted to start off 2022 with a great review of Les Amis .  Celebrated my wife’s birthday and it was our first time visiting .  Everything from start to finish (2hrs) was awesome .  Staff and service great and knowledgeable  We had the 3 course lunch , and it was enough to keep us full and satisfied .  I will not reveal too much here but would like to recommend everyone to come here for memorable occasions!!"

Les Amis,50,Excellent Service and Delectable Food,"As a birthday celebration, we booked the Chef's Table at Les Amis. Having the view of the very clean kitchen and watching the chefs do their work was a joy to behold! You can see how each dish is carefully prepared, so much so that we started asking our waitress, Catherine, what they were doing. The head chef, Sebastien Lepinoy, even waved at us after he was done with his work in the kitchen. The service was excellent and each dish that was brought to us was presented and explained on what the dish is made off, where the ingredients came from, and how it was prepared.    We had chosen the Winter Menu, which was a 4-course meal. We were not rushed at all during the entire session, and that we spent 4 hours at Les Amis enjoying ourselves. Many would say that this restaurant is expensive, but when the bill arrived, I was glad to pay it. To me, the food and service definitely reflects the price you pay for. Our servers, Catherine and Patrick, were great hosts and entertained our every wish. They definitely exerted effort to ensure we had a great time, and I was even surprised to receive a birthday cake with birthday greetings meticulously written on the plate! We look forward to dining at Les Amis again!"

Les Amis,50,Amazing Experience,"Had lunch at Les Amis and it’s hands down one of the best experience. The dining, food and above all, the great service. Staff were friendly and went out of their way to pack the leftover bread and cheese for us. They even packed additional cake for us which is way beyond our expectations. ( BTW bread were amazing, they should open a bakery)    We have tried several Michelin star restaurants and this is hands down one of the best experiences. Thanks for the great meal and we will definitely be back!    10 Dec 2021"

Les Amis,50,ART meets FOOD!,"If you love French haute cuisine, this place can offer a holistic a true feast for your senses. One of my top 5 restaurants in Singapore. Thank you Chef Lepinoy!"

Les Amis,20,Maybe 1 Star in France,"One would think that 3 Michelin stars should mean the same all over the world. At least for French cuisine, that is not the case. I am not sure Les Amis would get 1 star in France.    The best part of the experience at Les Amis was the wines, which were fine though obviously pricey.    The food itself was a disappointment. Pretty much everything was bland and generally run-of-the-mill, without the kind of creativity and visual appeal you get from top (or ambitious) chefs in France.    For example, theme of the month was apparently tomatoes. I love tomatoes, but the ones we got, in three different varieties, were all bland. As for visual appeal, I refer to the pictures posted by other reviewers, then invite comparison with pictures reviewers post for three-star restaurants in Paris.    The white peach dessert was probably the best course we had, but you had to try very hard to taste peach—it could have been any other fruit, it would not have made a difference (not least because the verbena was a bit more powerful than probably intended). It looked nice enough, but so do many of the cakes at Singapore's better cakeries.    Service felt awkward, down to the explanation how to read and order from the menu.    I will not return."

Les Amis,50,Fine dining at its absolute best — This is how it’s done people!,"As part of my solo staycation, I decided to splurge the big bucks and dine at Les Amis — one of only three restaurants in Singapore to hold the revered 3 Michelin Stars rating.    The restaurant’s location itself is unassuming, located along the sidewalk of Shaw Centre, which itself is situated in Singapore’s premier shopping district Orchard Road.    Upon arriving, I was shown to my table and presented the menu. I was also given the choice of either still or sparkling water, of which I chose the latter.    THE MENU    Les Amis offers both a la carte and tasting menu for dinner — with two types of tasting menu available. There’s the S$375 “Le Menu D’Automne Classique” four-course menu and for those looking for the full experience, the S$510 six-course “Le Menu D’Automne Degustation”. I selected the Degustation menu — with the sole caveat being that I was a bit sensitive to cheese and requested to replace the “Alba white truffle presented finely on a silky cheese soufflé” dish with something else. Upon consulting with the chef, the waitress serving me informed me that they’d be able to replace that dish with a cold appetiser of “capellini pasta with Kristal caviar and freshly shaved white alba truffle”. Yes please!    THE FOOD    Dinner began with a selection of freshly baked bread that I was free to choose from the bread cart — served table side. I was also given a couple of “finger food” and amuse bouche to whet my appetite, including a roasted chicken dish served with a fruit based curry dip, an onion tart, and a cold soup. All of these before we kicked off the items on the menu.    The first course was the aforementioned, specially made “capellini pasta with Kristal caviar and freshly shaved white alba truffle”, which was simple yet decadent. The delightful mix of the fragrant white truffle and the ocean water-like caviar cannot be understated and the dish tasted every bit as good as it looked.    Next up was the appetiser of “Kegani crab served with Oscietra caviar (S$40 supplement), balanced with autumn apples for subtle acidity”. Caviar and crab have long been best friends and this dish did not disappoint.    The next course was arguably my favourite from the menu. The “slow roasted scallop from the coast of Erquy with autumn herbs & seaweed sauce”. The scallop itself was possibly the largest scallop I’ve ever had. Erquy in Northern France is considered the scallop capital, and with great reason too! According to the waitress, Erquy scallops are only allowed to be caught twice weekly, due to the town’s sustainability efforts to prevent the clams from being overfished. They are required to be of a certain size before being caught, which explains its soft, supple and sweet flavour. This is a must-have dish!    From the heights of the scallop, this was followed by a more muted dish consisting of “wild salmon from Isigny cooked in its own skin & served with civet sauce”. For me, this was perhaps the weakest dish on the menu, as I found the salmon skin to be a tad bitter. The civet sauce is meant to complement the salmon’s highly distinctive taste, but I do not think it was strong enough to actually do so.    On with the main course, and I had the choice of either duck or beef — once again, I chose the latter choice — “beef tenderloin with aromatics, natural jus, celeriac and green herb salad”. The beef itself was a succulent piece of Australian wagyu sourced from Blackmore, one of the country’s premier beef farms. Cooked a perfect medium rare, it was presented simply and was nicely complemented by the flavoursome celeriac.    A palette cleanser course followed, which consisted of home-made ice cream. A total of six flavours were available but I chose just two — vanilla and honey. The vanilla ice cream is made from the vanilla pod, ensuring a nice intensity of flavour that vanilla extract could never deliver. Meanwhile, the honey ice cream was made from 4-5 different types of honey, which gave it its fantastic honey comb type flavour. Move over store bought honey/syrup — this is the real deal!    The final course of the night was a refreshing dessert of “silky caramel custard flan in Saint-Honore style with Tahiti vanilla chantilly cream”. The caramel custard was sweet without being sinfully so, and worked beautifully with the wonderfully light vanilla cream.    THE SERVICE    Les Amis gets top marks for its service, which was attentive without being intrusive. Throughout the entire dinner experience, I was always addressed by name, and this is something I’ve never experienced before… even in other 3 Michelin Star establishments.    The waiting staff were clearly well trained. From satisfying the foodie in me by providing plenty of information about each individual dish, or seemingly taking pity of me dining on my lonesome by giving me a copy of Epicure magazine to read between courses (nice touch there guys), to perfecting the art of a quenelle when scooping the ice cream — these little things just helped elevate the dining experience into something truly magical!    THE VERDICT    Don’t ever skimp on the opportunity to dine at Les Amis. The restaurant’s every bit as good as one might expect, and then some! Whether you’re going on for a romantic date for two, hanging out with friends, or like me —- curing a bad case of cabin fever by having a solo meal, Les Amis delivers in spades."

Les Amis,50,Beyond exceptional service,"NEEDLESS TO SAY, FOOD WAS EXCEPTIONAL… ordered, blue lobster, duck, ox tongue among many other plates… Service is beyond exceptional… after spending almost 3 hours, we rushed and forgot that I’ve ordered a cake, until a gentleman called me asking whether we were still around to collect the cake. We had already left and I asked if home delivery could be arranged. Immediate reaction was “we’ll communicate via WhatsApp “. Shortly after, i had the decent gentleman who was serving us all the restaurant, coming to my place to hand me, not only the cake but also a nice cheese selection (that I actually tasted at the restaurant and was clear that I loved it!). I was asking how to pay for the cake at least, but he insisted nothing to be paid and was apologizing about the miss of the cake earlier… Forgot to also mention, that the same gentleman had offered us few brioches to go as he noticed we were enjoying it… it’s those little gestures that set apart legendary sense of hospitality from just conventional great service… simply - THANK YOU!!"

Les Amis,50,Worthy of 3-star Michelin,"We wanted a restaurant with a cheese trolley and so booked Les Amis. We were greeted by a bread trolley (yay!) and a cheese trolley which is amazing during Covid times.    Our lunch was fabulous -- the staff was very attentive and noticed my partner was left-handed. One staff (Indian- sorry, didn't get his name), was especially good. He explained all the food (origins & preparation) and was patient when I asked a lot of questions about the menu.    We had wines by the glass --- they don't do an offiical wine pairing and their wines by the bottle tend to be brand-name wines. The sommelier did a good job of matching the wine available by the glasses with each course, explaining what to look for in the wine pairing.    They have a seasonal menu. What especially impressed us was the sea urchin souffle and the use of celeriac. And the breads and cheese were fantastic, which is exactly what we're looking for at a French restaurant.    We used to go to Robuchon and Vianney Massot before they closed down, so it's great to find a French restaurant in Singapore that does it right."

Les Amis,50,An exceptional experience!,"We had a exceptional dinner at Les Amis, just before lockdown! From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, to the moment we left, we were always greeted with warm smiles and amazing service all throughout.    To be more specific, Shaun (Head Waiter), Catherine and Pei Wen (Head Waitress) took amazing care of us in our private room! They were attentive, yet giving us our privacy, professional yet warm (not aloof/standoffish). They were very genuine and sincere, which made us feel very welcome. Understanding that this was the last night before the restaurant closed for Phase 2 (HA), a few dishes were not available, and poor Shaun kept on apologising about it, even though we kept telling him we understood. He was really genuine and nice, he really made our night!    The food, of course, was stunning as usual. Every dish was executed perfectly in terms of taste and presentation, and we really enjoyed it.    We really had a great time there and we can't wait to be back!"

Les Amis,50,"Memorable Birthday lunch, thanks to Shaun !","We went to Les Amis for lunch to celebrate my birthday. The service was top notch! Shaun was very attentive and efficient, he noticed I was left handed after first course.. and from then on, all knives were set on my left. He was also very candid and shared his knowledge of the origin of the produces used and the preparation put into the dishes patiently. I enjoyed his sharing very much. His great hospitality and humbled nature certainly enhanced my dinning experience tremendously.  The food were very delicate and well presented, truly pleasing to the eyes.. and we enjoyed the taste and freshness of the French produces too.  We admired the skills and efforts in preparing these exquisite dishes by the chefs. It was a very memorable lunch indeed. Thank you to the impeccable team @ Les Amis !"

Les Amis,50,Impeccable service and exquisite meal,"The waiters are extremely attentive and friendly, and pays great attention to details. The food is exquisite, full of well-balanced flavour; we especially like the salmon tartare, the cheese platter is also impressive. Very enjoyable lunch experience."

Les Amis,20,Very disappointed for a 3 stars,"It was our first 3-stars in Singapore after diners in 1 or 2-stars. Being in a 3-stars is not just a diner. It’s an experience, a trip. Unfortunately this one didn’t meet our expectations.    Nevermind that the setting is not as fancy and modern as it is generally in such places. The decoration is not what we eat.    In the plate if the products are the best of the best from France, the transformation by the Chef is not what we can expect from a 3-stars. And the tone is given by the amuse-bouche. Extremely simple and not generous (a gougère and a piece of comté rolled into a dry meat slice) compared with what is done in other high level restaurants. I ordered the chevreuil as main course. Once again the meat was excellent but the presentation was very simple (some pieces of meat in the plate) with a sort of chutney in the middle. Too simple for a 3-stars. Where is the transformation by the Chef in order to sublimate the products? Let’s add that the dessert, a clementine, was truly excellent.    The service is really good, attentive and careful. The smiles of the team are very generous. Just a word on the wine menu which is amazing. Nevertheless the sommelier should not just say that everything is good (we can assume having regards to the wine menu). We would have appreciated to have advices and a discussion with the expert he is supposed to be.    Definitely not as high as it should be."

Les Amis,40,Traditional French,This cosy Michelin star restaurant is perfect for satisfying one’s craving for traditional French meal with fine wines and an amazing selection of cheeses.

Les Amis,50,"Great food, great experience","One of the best fine dining experience which we ever had in Singapore. There is a reason why they are still here after all these years. The meal was delicious. The service was fantastic. It is a bit pricey, but basically you get what you paid for. A great choice for celebrations and special occasions."

Les Amis,50,Surprisingly Impressed,"I had high expectations going into this dinner. I'm not a big believer in the erratic and seemingly bias Michelin star system but had heard enough strong reviews to give it a try. I was willing to spend the cash for a luxury culinary experience (end bill was $1.2k+/2p) but expected a lot. Les Amis delivered on service, food quality/taste and ambience.    This is not an easy task during the height of the COVID 19 pandemic. So kudos to Les Amis for such deft handling.    We had the smaller (4 course) degustation menu. It was enough food - the additional amuse bouche dishes and the richness of the food ensured that. The food quality, presentation and taste were high - I think I said ""Wow"" for almost every dish.    Again, this is a special occasion venue (unless the company is paying!!). Otherwise hard to justify spending over a grand for a meal for 2p.    NB: I ate at the old CePage in HK (years ago when it was still open) and that place was terrible and a rip off."

Les Amis,20,mediocre experience at exorbitant price,"was prepared to spend at this not-cheap establishment so 5-course menu price didn’t surprise me to begin with.    the mezzanine where we’re seated were quite stuffy as warm air gushes in every time the door was opened. (so try avoiding mezz if possible). food was ok throughout but nothing really stands out, with a 3 star michelin rating one’s expectation would be high however that seems rather mediocre.    service wise was really below average. both servers & sommelier seems rather transactional and wasn’t engaged despite briefly introducing the dishes. one lovely offering was the huge chunk of 125g butter created large to retain moisture and taste, but 120g unconsumed butter just went into food wastage unfortunately.    they say ‘clothes make the man’ & in terms of fine dining i would suggest ‘experience completes the dinner’. unfortunately the experience was very flat and forgettable.    for a 4-digit spend one can easily find a better experience at fraction of the price.    Les Amis team surely you guys can do better and i look forward to return one day!"

Les Amis,50,The places will never disappointed you,This is the Best restaurants I ever had.  This is the one and only one restaurant that never and ever will disappoint you

Les Amis,40,An very good French restaurant with an extrodinary price tag.,"My wife and I enjoyed our dinner at Les Amis. The food, the service and the wine list were all very good. The two younger couples sitting across from us could have kept their shoes on during dinner, but that's about it in term of negative feedback.  Les Amis is an old school French restaurant in Singapore. And there lies the rub. If you live in a French city, like we do, Les Amis is good, even very good. But wildly overpriced."

Odette's Restaurant,50,Simply Delicious,This was our third visit and it didn’t disappoint. The staff were polite and made us feel welcome. The food was delicious and excellently presented. We will re-visit again.

Odette's Restaurant,40,"Nice food, good value!","Friendly staff, nice decor, interesting menu, tasty food, good price. Perfect lunch in Primrose Hill."

Odette's Restaurant,30,Not on my list for a return visit!,"My son booked Odette’s for Saturday evening dinner. Food I cannot fault. It was flavoursome, well presented and each of us enjoyed our choices. However, I have to agree with several other reviewers who comment on staff attitude towards some diners. Snooty! Best describes the welcome we received. The table next to our was fussed over, cleaned of crumbs, little witticisms shared and constant checking in. We were basically ignored until food was ready to serve. At the end of the evening I tip for service received and to add 13.5% to a bill which was already over £300 for 4 people who have had 2 courses and a shared pudding, 1 bottle of average white wine and some sparkling water, where service was below expectations is insulting. We will not be back nor will we recommend."

Odette's Restaurant,50,"Odette’s: great experience, again!","We’ve returned to Odette’s, and again, it was a superb experience. My wife and I asked pork for the starter. As mains, halibut for her and lamb for me: delicious. Perfect dessert: strawberry and meringue (please see picture)."

Odette's Restaurant,50,A memorable evening,"Everything was fantastic. I don’t need 100 characters! We had a wonderful experience, excellent food, fantastic service, great attention and a memorable evening."

Odette's Restaurant,20,Second Class Citizen?,"It would not be fair to comment on the quality of the food at Odette's as sadly we were not allowed in this restaurant but I certainly can comment on the attitude. On a day out in Primrose Hill we were hoping to enjoy lunch at one of its numerous restaurants. Admittedly it was very busy and a couple of places could not accommodate us but, having read good reviews about Odette's, I thought I would try to ask if there was any availability. I walked in and asked a gentleman if there was a free table, who replied it depended on how many people; so far not a problem. I then pointed out to my elderly mother and husband who were waiting outside and he immediately said that sorry there was no room. Now I may be over sensitive but I had the distinct impression that he did not think we were the right type of clientele for his establishment. Maybe we were not dressed up enough to fit the image they want to give but we were not in drags either. Personally I keep the dressing up for dining out, not for a relaxed Sunday lunch. And the ""Desole"" (sorry in French) was also totally unnecessary and came across as fairly snotty. Sadly I have come across too many so called French restaurants over the last 37 years I have lived in this country which think that they are superior because they have a French name and serve French cuisine. I have been lucky enough to go to a few Michelin restaurants in my time both here and in my home country of France and have rarely been treated in such manner. Maybe it is time some of those places realize that true class does not come with this type of attitude. But in the end I should thank the management at Odette's; because of them turning us away we discovered another place in primrose Hill off the beaten track called Fume and had one of the best meals we have had in a long time; refined Italian cooking, marvelous dishes and friendly attitude from the staff; and there were not too proud to take our business!"

Odette's Restaurant,50,Excellent precision cooking and tasty food,"We were three couples. Everyone loved the food. We thought all the food was very special. The service and ambiance was also excellent. We enjoyed the homemade soda bread with lovely butter [no extra charge]. We had 6 starters, 6 main courses plus 4 sides. We shared 3 desserts which were souffle and the Jaffa cake. Both were just great. We drank one bottle of red and one of white at £28 each. Service was 13.50%. The bill came to £470 i.e. £157 per couple. For the high standards of precision cooking we thought that a fair price. Especially with the increase in restaurant prices post covid. We left very happy."

Odette's Restaurant,20,Permafrost on Primrose Hill?,"I ordered a main, whilst my friend, she ordered 3 courses, deciding to share her starter and pudding all from the Sunday Lunch menu.    My main was the roast beef and my friend catch of the day. Herein was the nub of the problem as her fish was served with mussels of which my friend has a specifis allergy to. We alerted the waiter to this and we enquired why we hadn't been asked about allergies. He said we should have notified the booking site of this in effect blaming the matter entirely on us ie. victim blaming. There was no expression of concern by the waiter/ maitre de and if anything , by his manner and body language - just inconvenience.    I noticed that the other diners in the restaurant, ordering the same dishes as us appeared to have bigger prtions than us. Perhaps they were regular customers and/ or they were spending more than us.    I certainly regret paying the full discretionary service charge on account of the maitre de and his frosty behaviour, which was as inhospitable as the freezing cold wind blowing outside. I noted the continuence of his demeanour as we left, when his female colleague bade us a ""Good Afternoon"" he chose omertà.    Whilst the beef was cooked well and the food especially the bread was good, it was difficult see anything ""value added"" about the experience and was poor value for money."

Odette's Restaurant,20,Disappointing tasting menu lunch,"Disappointing tasting menu lunch. We went for the tasting menu lunch to celebrate my sister’s recent marriage. One of our diners, my wife, is a coeliac. I informed the restaurant ahead of time. Instead of replacing food that my wife couldn’t eat they simply removed it. This left her the odd one out - and also less well-fed. Courses were generally well executed but unimaginative. Service was slow to the point of being non-existent. Would not recommend."

Odette's Restaurant,50,Lazy Sunday Afternoon,"We have been several times for Sunday lunch before, but opted for the chicken and the classic fish and shrimp dishes instead of the roast beef this time. 3 courses of this quality in such a cosy environment with fabulous service is exceptional value for money. Really can’t recommend it highly enough.    We didn’t want to leave but eventually tore ourselves away and had a lovely chat with the charming chef/proprietor on the way out. He always seems happy to have a chat even though he’s somewhat of a celebrity chef."

Odette's Restaurant,50,"Delicious, reasonably priced food and great wine selection in a really lovely environment","It’s difficult to balance clinical professionalism and first class quality of fantastic food with a relaxed, warm and friendly environment delivered by great service - but this is how I would describe our lunch at l’autre. The emphasis on excellent ingredients and imagination going into the hard work of preparing the essential components of each course was immediately obvious. Presentation was fantastic but didn’t detract from the delivery of a meal which was delivered in perfect portion sizes whilst also displaying the delicious food to best effect.    Whatever you do, don’t miss the Welsh beef or the Gigondas!    Recommended 100%"

Noma,40,Almost there,"Would rate my visit a 8 out of 10. Nice presentation of all dishes and warm and welcoming atmosphere. Most of the dishes tasted really good but some of them felt “rushed”. For the hype and price point I expect nothing else than perfection and it didn’t live up to that. Still, a really nice experience and well composed dishes.    I really really enjoyed the Georgian wine 😊"

Noma,50,Perfection,"Perfection. Food couldn't be better, same for design and service. Each dish is carefully thought of, both in culinary and design terms. The service is kind, attentive and friendly. Must go"

Noma,30,Well past its apex,"noma has been on my bucket list for a few years, but it has eluded me due to the sheer impossibility of getting a table. Courtesy of a dear someone who seems to be a reservation ninja, I was able to eat at a shared table. The place is gorgeous and the setting quaint. Service is friendly and attentive, i.e., 3 star worthy. The food, however, was a huge letdown. The vegetable menu was just not enough to satiate a child. The main was a single mushroom (!). Some of the flavors were plain odd. Mind you, I know my food. Just look at all my other reviews. The wine pairing was exotic. But exotic does not mean good either. Some drops were good, others tasted like cat p*ss. I feel arrogance has creeped into the experience. The chef resting on his laurels has decided to make a mockery of diners it seems. While I do appreciate the art of making amazing food, it also has to be good. And this, unfortunately was a bit of a hit and miss. Go ahead noma, close down sooner than later. Make space for more passionate chefs who actually want to wow their diners with flavors and not ""concepts."""

Noma,50,Best Restaurant in the world!,"I’ve been fortunate to have dined 5 times at noma in the past 7 years, and all of my meals have been AMAZING! The cuisine is delicious and creative! The hospitality and service is the BEST! The staff is the most welcoming and attentive. I feel as if I’m dining with good friends. The decor is lovely."

Noma,50,Unique Nordic experience,"Food: Vegetarian season. Quite an experience. Some of the dishes were quite outstanding but I’m not blown away, sadly. Still worthy of 5 stars for creativity, presentation and for those 5-6 mindblowing dishes.  Wine: Bottle of Domaine de Chassorney - Saint Romain. On point. BdB champagne to start with. Excellent. Glass of top Chenin to round off the night. Suggested by the Sommelier. Really happy that they did not push the wine menu although some of the wines on the menu on offer seemed quite interesting.  Service: Relaxed. Too relaxed for my taste but friendly, polite and welcoming.  Experience: beautiful location, amazing entrance, original interior, good development in the menu. You feel like you’re visiting an institution without feeling alienated. Very unique. I see this as a once in a lifetime experience. Happy to have tried Noma but not eager to go back."

Noma,50,A super-nature joyride,"Aware of Nomas reputation, but intentionally avoided reading up in advance, I was ready for the complete surprise.    A true multisensory experience - from the greenhouses set in nature, to the light filled wooden architecture, to the open interaction between the kitchen and the diners    Unexpected was the natural, genuine humour and honesty of the waiting staff, of whom we met many throughout the courses    If this vegetable season menu needed any more superlatives than have already been written, it was a super-natural-fresh, sensory comfort zone expanding joyride - all presented on humble, impeccably crafted plates, bowls and cutlery    All was bookended with a welcoming tour of the kitchen and labs, greeted by the teams who have given their life to this place - may hundreds of careers be launched post-Noma"

Noma,10,Worst restaurant ever,"Worst restaurant I have ever been. See food from grill was full of oil, no taste. Original sea foot plate were noodles with 2 crevets. No possibility to pay by card"

Noma,50,Unique experience,"It is tough to Noma to exceed your expectations but Noma was successful in doing it. The fully vegetarian summer menu is amazing, light and has an excellent bio wine pairing"

Noma,40,Forget Me Not,"Experimental, for sure. The menu reads as if designed to be as impactful & memorable. From reindeer's heart, brains and penis, it is certainly a meal to write home about. Whilst it delivered on presentation and conception, it fell short on flavour and texture (except reindeer’s heart which was masterful in preparation). Service is perplexing but not offensive - steely cold vibe mixed in with some informal humour. The wine pairing is underwhelming. I would be back if I didn’t have to jump thru hoops and someone shouting dinner."

Noma,50,Best food experience I have had,"It was amazing. Expectations was high, and they delivered. On atmosphere, on service, on wine, and definitely on the food. Worth every penny? Depends on how many pennies you have. Best food experience I have had? Yes."

Noma,50,Worth the hype,"I had high expectations for the world's best restaurant (for several years) and it exceeded them. The whole experience right from when you are greeted at the door, to the story, presentation of the food, the service and decor and of course, the food, is world class.  We had the forest and game season which had pretty much used all the edible parts of the deer, plus bear fat, and duck. The wine pairing was the best I've ever tasted.  Worth the anticipation, worth the price. We are hoping to get a spot at their Tokyo pop up."

Noma,50,6 hours experience for foodies,"6 hours experience for foodies, I was skeptical as this is a 3 star restaurant so the expectations where at the highest possible level and I must admit they delivered on all stars and more.  There was always personal attention on the costumers, if you just dine or have been at the rest room, you will be seated and waited all time, the chefs present the food themself and the waiters has so much control and understanding of all aspects of the environment, food, drinks and what we have.  Will definitive come back again some time."

Noma,50,"A wild, wonderful culinary ride",Noma is not easy to describe. It’s FANTASTIC and it’s bold as well as pleasant. It’s one of the great culinary places of the world and deserves its reputation. But it’s not for every diner: this is where you go when you crazy flavors and experimental food preparations. Not for unadventurous eaters. I LOVED it.    I can also recommend trying the shared table option as a solo traveler. I met three super-interesting people from around the world.

Noma,50,"Noma 2,0 - Ocean season","We took a daytrip from Stockholm for lunch. From the moment of arrival to leaving a superb experience. Perfect wine pairing with all the courses. They took good care of us and explained all the courses perfect, together with the wine."

Noma,50,On a different level,There is a reason that Noma has been named the best restaurant in the world and has 3 Michelin Stars. Absolutely amazing from start to finish.

Noma,40,"High expectations, some disappointments","We have heard about Noma 10 years ago and so we were thrilled to finally get a table there.  We have done multiples 3 star Michelin restaurants in Paris, New York, Vegas and recently the Mirazure in Menton.    The cuisine Noma serves is experimental and the flavors of each dish is unique. Our menu had 15 courses each tasty whether salty of sweet. We loved it but found it a bit hard to start with reindeer’s heart, followed by its brain and the penis. And we are used to such type of cuisine. Maybe they should mention that some dish may contain the animals insides.    we also chose the wine pairing with it but were not “transported” by it. While some wines come from very small vineyards, they were often cheap wine. We had a “green” wine from Tours which was hard to drink. Another one was quite strong compared to the dish which was fairly delicate. We appreciated some of the unusual wines nonetheless but found that 200 euros was way overpriced, even for a 3 star restaurant.    The service was excellent, casual but perfect.    All in all, for 3000 euros for 4 persons you expect perfection. And while we had a wonderful experience this was not perfection and in all honesty we will not come back, at least not on this menu."

Noma,50,Worth the 5 year wait!,"The most amazingly theatrical, sensory and delicious evening ever! From the minute you arrive and every one of the 20 to 30 chefs says ‘Good Evening’ to you until you leave 15 sensational courses later, it is an absolute feast! 8 wine pairings too which are unique and diverse, every single one is a perfect match to the food. Was it worth the 5 year wait it took for me to get a reservation in Vegetable Season - absolutely. Hope it won’t be 5 years before we can return!"

Noma,40,Pretentious but quite an experience,15 courses of vegetables all exquisitely prepared with a wine paring of mostly wines you will never have heard of or tasted before. Arrived at 6pm and left at 11.45 longest meal I ever had. Would I go again - no but probably would advise a friend to go just for the experience. Be careful mindbogglingly expensive if you have to ask you can't afford it. Service was exemplary probably more staff than diners.

Noma,40,Fantastic experience albeit heavily on the experimental side,"If ever given the chance to eat at Noma, one should not hesitate for a second but be sure to keep a very open mind. To start with being a meat lover in the middle of the vegetarian season is probably not the best combo but to be fair, several dishes are barbecued in a way to resemble meat such as the mushroom main dish which even looks like a piece of steak. The staff is as expected outstanding and each dish is served by a different staff member so guests kind of get to know all of them.  The wine list also requires the same open mind unless someone is truly a fan of organic and natural wines. If not, then it’s probably best to choose a wine you know and like from the wine list, although one would be mistaken to think that most well known wine brands would be available here. Noma is all about experimenting on all levels, food and drinks but an open mind will make it an enjoyable experience."

Noma,50,Perfection,We’ve been waiting to get here for a long time now….. but finally the opportunity arose (wife’s birthday celebration) and all of us were completely bowled over by the whole dining experience…near perfection on everything…from the meet and greet ( by all staff) … the incredibly friendly service … to the absolutely delicious food …we left very contented…and would highly recommend a visit

Noma,50,A bucket list must,I’ve tried more tasting menus than I care to mention and it takes a lot for an top rated one to live up to the hype. But this was well and truly a culinary journey like no other. I will remember the dishes and the effect they have on all five senses for years to come. It was worth the wait and I feel very lucky my colleagues in Denmark decided on this place for our annual event.

Noma,40,Not superlative,"A recurrent winner of “World’s Best Restaurant” which it recently lost to Geranium, also in Copenhagen.    Now a Michelin 3* destination, we obtained reservations for 1245 lunch seating on my birthday with my husband and friends who flew in from USA to meet us.    My girlfriend is a big fan of detailed meal preparation and has Rene Redzepi's book on Fermentation.    We were greeted at the curb and escorted through the dreamy farm setting through the garden with a table at the entrance showing the ingredients for the vegetable season, an opening Tart comprised of Potatoes plus Nasturtium exceedingly delicate prior to a Summer Salad featuring Berries, smoked Sauce and Fava Beans.    (the list of the food courses here I took from a prior review, which did a great job of summarizing them, and added my comments)    The next dish was an amazingly wrought, grilled Pepper stuffed with unripe Strawberry and Seeds garnished by squeezable Rhubarb followed by a “Pea and White Currant Dumpling” encased in translucent White Currant “leather.”    Next wowing with a Dolma of Cucumber Skin filled with Barley Koji, somehow more complex than those stuffed with Lamb, assertive Elderflower-Black Currant Juice provides great balance to Young Onion Gel with Cream and a high-effort Radish Pie.    Designed to suggest a Nordic village, natural décor throughout an airy space flooded with light, “Scoby Steak” proves to be one of noma’s more conceptual dishes in its use of thick Kombucha Skin topped by Marigold Chili Oil while the Flowers find themselves Tempura-battered in follow up and ready to be dragged through Whiskey-fortified Egg Yolk.    I thought both of these dishes were barely edible, not pleasing or delightful to the palate at all. Scoby is the layer that forms on fermented food and they decided to serve it with a delicious sauce. I thought maybe they were laughing to see how many people would actually eat it.    I believe the tempura flower was a geranium which is ironic in that their preparation of it was tasteless and the Copenhagen restaurant Geranium is celebrating being named best restaurant in July 2022.    Continuing with Rhubarb and Pine Shoots, a gooey Egg colored by Beets preceding Potatoes packed in Sea Lettuce with Gooseberry, “entrees” consisted of a grilled Artichoke taken whole from the Stem with Chives before a roasted Lion’s Mane Mushroom with sides of Sauce and Salad said to represent a “Steak Dinner.”    The preparation and service of these dishes was sublime.    They finished with “palate cleanser” Salads of France with one including Chocolate and Herbs, more successful than it sounds, fragrant Tea lends perfectly to “A Dessert of Oatmeal and Honey” as well as its honey “chew and spit” chaser which again ironically left wax on your teeth exactly like the child's candy with sweetened wax teeth.    The staff was of course personable and attentive. My friend's book got signed by some present.    As we were escorted out with a perfunctory tour to the curb, I asked if Rene Redzepi was there and was told ""no, he has no need!"" Probably meant to encourage us to understand how well his staff is trained. I asked if he comes in for lunch or dinner and was told, ""sometimes.""    That spoke volumes to me. I do think the noma experience and presentation is amazing, landmark, and experiential. I do think Rene's presence and involvement with an audience who travels literally from across the globe to have lunch with him would be beneficial."

Noma,50,Great Evening - Menu A Bit On The Safe Side,"As expected a great evening, the setting, the building, the amount of work that has gone into every dish.  We truly enjoyed the meal, even if the vegetarian menu was a bit on the dull side and maybe a bit too safe, there was nothing that took you outside your comfort zone, and isn't it party for this that one goes to a place like Noma?  I was missing a greater variety in produce, something one is not used to eating, the Danish fauna has more to offer than Raspberry on every third dish.  Also the sommeliers recommended wines were in general not to our liking.  Still a great meal though, and well done by the Noma team!"

Noma,50,Unlike anything I have eaten before - in a good way!,"Our experience at Noma was very special. The location is very unassuming, we would never have known the restaurant was there if we hadn't been going there. There is nothing 'show offy' about the location at all with little if any signage. There was a lovely welcome which made us feel very special. The food was glorious and unlike anything we had eaten before. It was all delicious and supremely innovative. It looked spectacular and some dishes were so pretty that it was difficult to believe that it was edible. We are not vegetarians but we booked during the Vegetarian Season and we can honestly say that we didn't miss meat or fish, the menu was inventive and delicious.The attention to detail in both presentation, flavour and texture was amazing. The wine and non alcoholic options were very good and well priced given the quality. The staff were attentive and engaging without being overpowering. The restaurant itself was stylish and comfortable. We felt very comfortable during our meal and unlike some restaurants that serve food of similar quality, we didn't feel out of place or 'judged' by staff or other diners. I would recommend Noma to anyone who wants a special dining experience to share with friends or family. It really is a great experience."

Noma,50,Best restaurant in the world!,"We have been at Noma three times the last year and it has been absolutely wonderful every single time. Amazing innovative food, friendly staff, terrific ambiance and nice surroundings. We were, I must admit, a little skeptical before our latest visit in July this year when we were informed that the menu was entirely vegetarian, but after eating all dishes we did not a single time miss meat, fish or shellfish."

Noma,40,Most certainly a destination,"A recurrent winner of “World’s Best Restaurant” in its original format and again capturing the top prize in 2021 noma needs no introduction, Chef René Redzepi’s creation of New Nordic Cuisine having shifted the landscape of fine dining over a decade before the Restaurant shuttered only to reopen in 2018 on the grounds of former wasteland.    Now a Michelin 3* destination, the shift towards three yearly menus with extensive R&D and an entirely custom-built space elevating the experience even further, a visit to noma begins with obtaining a hotly-contested reservation at the cost of DKK 3,000 plus another 1,000 for Juice – roughly $550USD all-in.    The flag-bearer of foraging and fermentation, ideas pioneered by the likes of Veyrat and throughout Japan brought front-and-center by Redzepi, Summer sees noma serving a wholly-Vegetarian menu where guests begin in a self-adjusting greenhouse with Tea before entering an expansive space featuring three dining areas, open kitchen, live-tanks plus room for experimentation and storage.    Employing a staff of over one-hundred including four full-time gardeners to feed just 42 diners a day, though this concept will again change soon, it is once seated that gracious servers deliver a seamless experience across four-hours, an opening Tart comprised of Potatoes plus Nasturtium exceedingly delicate prior to a Summer Salad featuring Berries, smoked Sauce and Fava Beans.    Undoubtedly putting a lot of thought into the pairings, Natural Wines versus Juice and Tea, herbaceous Cucumber Juice signaled the arrival of a grilled Pepper stuffed with unripe Strawberry and Seeds garnished by squeezable Rhubarb followed by a “Pea and White Currant Dumpling” encased in translucent White Currant “leather.”    Next wowing with a Dolma of Cucumber Skin filled with Barley Koji, somehow more complex than those stuffed with Lamb, assertive Elderflower-Black Currant Juice provides great balance to Young Onion Gel with Cream and a high-effort Radish Pie.    Designed to suggest a Nordic village, natural décor throughout an airy space flooded with light, “Scoby Steak” proves to be one of noma’s more conceptual dishes in its use of thick Kombucha Skin topped by Marigold Chili Oil while the Flowers find themselves Tempura-battered in follow up and ready to be dragged through Whiskey-fortified Egg Yolk.    Continuing with Rhubarb and Pine Shoots, a gooey Egg colored by Beets preceding Potatoes packed in Sea Lettuce with Gooseberry, “entrees” consisted of a grilled Artichoke taken whole from the Stem with Chives before a roasted Lion’s Mane Mushroom with sides of Sauce and Salad said to represent a “Steak Dinner.”    Rethinking the “palate cleanser” Salads of France with one including Chocolate and Herbs, more successful than it sounds, fragrant Tea lends perfectly to “A Dessert of Oatmeal and Honey” as well as its “chew and spit” chaser before a fond farewell and comprehensive look at everything that goes into being the ""best,"" whether one agrees with the term and assessment or not."

Noma,50,Unique dining experience,A welcoming atmosphere in a pastoral setting. The tasting menu in the summer season (vegetarian) was of cutting edge originality with a most esthetic presentation. The wine and juice pairing (possible also to mix) was spot on and eclectic. A unique and inspiring dining experience.

Noma,50,Hard to describe how good it is,"From the moment you arrive you’re treated like friends by the very welcoming staff. The food as you’d expect was something special and hard to describe other than to say unique. We had the seafood menu and it was amazing from start to finish. If you get to go, the expense is worth the overall experience"

Noma,50,Exceptional Eden-esque Experience,"Went in with zero expectations. From entering the grounds through a field of flowers, to being welcomed by a ton of staff, to the utmost attention to detail in decor and food and wine and juice— this was exceptional. We loved our wait staff. They were beyond warm and knowledgeable and respectfully attentive. I don’t know how to go up from here."

Noma,40,Made a better impression before it became famous,"The dishes are still outstanding, but there is more emphasis on theater.  I have a problem with wine pairings which include natural wines, orange wine, cider and sake, Mercifully no mead was offered.  The wine list succeeds in filling scores of pages with producers unknown even to someone who for 50 years has had wine daily.  I feel the wine list and pairing was selected for effect, not to complement the food.  They have gone quite sustainable to the extent of not replacing even a quite soiled napkin.  Noma was once my absolute favorite, but with the experience of four 3-star restaurants in just the last month I do not like the direction Noma has taken even if the food is still great."

Noma,30,World's Best? Rather Underwhelming,"The food was as expected for this kind of restaurant and some of the dishes certainly split the crowd. Some skilful creations prepared with great care using the finest seasonal ingredients.    Tea in the greenhouse wasn't exactly the best start that any of us had experienced at a high end dinner. Also, being led to the restaurant from the greenhouse rather than being shown to a path and told to ""Follow the path to a wooden door."" (avoiding the copious amounts of duck doo doo) would have been more appropriate.    Having had poor wine pairing experiences in the past our party decided to go with bottles of wine from the list. The list appeared to list producers rather than varietals which made it slightly difficult to select a wine. The sommelier stepped in here. I requested an Albariño, preferably from Galicia, as this has paired well with similar seafood taster menus in the past. None were available, but I was recommended a Verdejo from a producer in Castilla y Leon, whom I had not previously encountered, but which worked with most courses. On the bill the bottles of wine were simply listed as ""White wine"", so impossible to check out the producer.    First course of crab broth inside a crabs head and drunk through the mouth opening unfortunately left me with a rather pungent smell which lingered with me for the majority or the service. Simply providing a drinking straw may have prevented this. A waiter commenting that the blanched scallop may twitch as some of the nerves may still be ""alive"" was possibly not the best advice to give, particularly if a member of the party is sensitive to comments such as these.  I personally enjoyed most courses. Others has a different opinion.    We were presented with a copy of the menu at the end of the meal. May have been a better idea to be given a copy at the beginning in order to track the progress of the experience.    Staff were all friendly enough, every member of staff greeting you as you are shown to your table. All waiting staff had good knowledge of the courses and ingredients.    The attention to detail which is expected at a high end restaurant was a bit of a let down; serving the next course when one member of the party was not at the table, clearing plates when not all diners had finished, leaning across diners to serve others, the inability to serve an Americano, instead of an espresso or filter coffee, lack of petit fours (the finale), the poor quality if wine glasses (rolled rims). Not really what you'd expect of a 3 Star Michelin restaurant, especially one which has so recently achieved that accolade. These points may seem slightly picky but................. ""Best Restaurant in the World"", 3 Stars.    I can understand what the restaurant is trying to present, but it just doesn't do it with 3 star refinement."

Noma,50,Lived up to the hype,"When you've been named ""best restaurant in the world"" 4 times, and when it takes years to make a dinner reservation, there is a certain level of expectation on a place.    I have to say that Noma lived up to this level of expectation, which when you think about it is really saying something.    Everything about the place was enjoyable, interesting, tasty and above all it was personable. I've been lucky enough to eat at many wonderful restaurants around the world and at some places there is a certain arrogance. Not so at Noma.    It all starts with the short walk from taxi drop off through an unmanicured field by a fairly ordinary lake flanked by greenhouses. You're met at the door and escorted past the completley open kitchen which is almost part of the restaurant piece itself. There's no menu (until after), but the waiting staff all discuss every course with you in as much detail (or not) as you'd like. We mentioned that we didn't want the full wine pairing as we don't drink enough to be able to manage it - no problem, they created a mixed wine/juice pairing for us and charged us very reasonably. Having said that, some of the wine was phenomenal and one of the best true ""pairings"" I've had. The food? Well the food speaks for itself...    If you're lucky enough to get a table just go."

Noma,50,There's only one original,"Noma revolutionized the global restaurant scene several years ago. Countless places around the world tried to copy its Nordic fine dining concept or were at least inspired by it. The global fame it has earned makes everyone - our group of diners included - come here for nothing less than an unforgettable experience. And Noma delivers. René Redzepi's approach is still similar at core to when he started Noma: creating a stripped-down fine dining experience, with a strictly local, seasonal menu. The new location allows an even more uncompromising execution. What makes the evening at Noma unique is not primarily the taste of the dishes - I actually have had more exciting experiences in this regard than the mostly subtle tastes of Noma's summer menu. It is the cuisine's astounding creativity, the dedication and determination with which the kitchen pursues its own vision of a perfect dining experience. It is something you will not get anywhere else. Although copied hundreds of times: the original still is the best."

Noma,20,A really bad experience!,"Food was average, boring at best. The wine pairing was completely unacceptable, a selection of cheap wine charged at top, burgundy prices. Very disappointing experience.👎"

Noma,50,An experience for life,"Despite having visited quite a number of great restaurants and ***Michelin, this is really something g special. A fantastic evening worth every Danish krone, a long show of fantastic creations. We were there at game and forest season which was superb - hope to get a chance to the other two seasons as well"

Noma,50,One Of the best - always!,"Same group Of friends as back in summer 2021. Another menu but still the greatest experience ever.    What really stands out is the ambiance and the feeling Of being at a cozy neighbourhood-place. I mean - the food is amazing, the service is perfect - but what is hard to create is the feeling you Get.    If you are able to Get a table it is so worth it. Expensive yes - but worth it."

Noma,50,No words needed,"Going to Noma is an unforgettable experience that you’ll remember for a long time. In each bite, something new. The staff is caring and out of the box. Amazing!"

Noma,50,Det er jo verdens bedste restaurant,Noma leaves you speachless- everything is just so perfect and above every expectation. It’s absolutely every penny worth. 👌

Noma,50,Tour de force,My third time at Noma - but my first at the new location. What is there to say? Rene continues to delight (and shock at times) and is firmly the god father of Nordic cuisine.  The new digs are spectacular- beautiful and serene - evoking a wood cabin in the woods with so much warmth and beauty. I just loved it.    The food is the epitome of creativity no question - cutting edge and challenging at times but absolutely delicious and balanced. Service as usual exemplary. What a treat to be able to come here again!

Noma,30,Came up short,"When you are named the best restaurant in the world it does create a whole new level of expectation.  The restaurant is certainly unique and is housed in the most stunning surroundings.  It’s like going back to nature. It was a fantastic experience overall which I felt was slightly let down by the food and wine.  Don’t get me wrong, there were 2 or 3 very good dishes. Very clever cooking. However, if I compare the food for example to Core in London (3 stars) I think it comes up a little short.  There were also one or two hiccups such a serving truffle to my wife after going to the trouble of asking if there were any things to avoid. Rectified the problem immediately without fuss though.  Biggest issue actually was knowing how to eat the dishes. For example 3 of us ate a massive lump of sumac which was on a skewer in a broth. It was only there for display. It ruined the dish and the next two that followed.    It all felt like a little bit of an experiment. Bit too clever maybe?"

Noma,50,Wrong expectations,"I was so convinced that this was not going to be something for me as I truly like French haute cuisine… but this was just great. Fantastic surroundings, truly amazing staff and food that keeps on surprising. Not always the best taste but playful and balanced and mostly outstanding. Best duck ever. The wine list is religiously biodynamic which is not my thing but it is true to the nature of the restaurant. Ask for a tour of the kitchen afterwards, never seen anything like it."

Noma,50,Simply Noma,It’s Noma. Simply. Whole place designed around food with the greatest detail. The staff shine with energy and enthusiasm. Out of 20+ courses I considered only a single one not to be an exceptionally tasty. It’s the highest level gastronomy focused on locally sourced best of the best ingredients and a well deserved place among the best restaurants in the world.

Noma,50,Brilliant and cozy,"Absolutely brilliant, super-nice facilities, excellent food and the service was top notch. Especially loved our fantastic French “guide” Marie that let us through the evening.    If you never been before, brace yourself for ants and other insects. It probably is the food of the future, but right here and now some may not like it… (And if you don’t they arrange alternatives)"

Noma,50,A dream come true,"I had been trying to get a table at Noma for a few years and this July my dream of visiting this famed restaurant came true.    Expectations were high as I had read/heard so much about the experimental cuisine and the experience. I was not disappointed.    Everything from the walk through the garden to reach the restaurant, the welcome by all the chefs, the service and if course the cuisine was memorable."

Noma,50,Best experience ever!,More than 2 years since last visit. This time a group of 7 and we had THE perfect experience. Hottest summerday in Copenhagen and it felt walking into an oasis. The venu is gorgeous and stunning. The food was amazing BUT most of all - the people working there manage to create an atmosphere that is just #perfection. Althoug a high-end place and expensive we felt among family/friends and had the best evening    Some of these restaurants might be: ‘been there done that’ - NOT NOMA. This is for sure a place to come back to - and I hope and believe we will and can!

Koka,30,"Had a nice dinner with tasty food, but was just average for level of fine dining","Food was alright, not the most unique dishes and taste was good but not amazing.    The environment felt quite basic and boring, nothing special about it. The staff did not really interact much with us, it was quite stale. They did however get along very well with other customers.    Would honestly not visit again, mostly because there are much better restaurants out there in the same price class."

Koka,50,Very well done!,"We had a wonderful evening at Koka! The food was excellent, perfect wine pairings (out of the ordinary, and well thought out), and efficient service made for an excellent night. The langoustine dish and chanterelle dish were both memorable. Well done, Koka."

Koka,50,Amazing vegan tasting menu,"Plant-based is the restaurant’s starting point so the vegan version of the tasting menu was well balanced and full of flavour. Although a lot of work had clearly gone into the exquisitely prepared dishes, the taste of the main ingredients remained distinct and fresh and the wine pairing perfectly enhanced the flavours. The friendly, attentive but not intrusive service completed this memorable experience. We cannot remember ever having had a better or more enjoyable meal and look forward to returning to Göteborg and Koka in the future."

Koka,50,Wonderful flavour combinations,"We were intrigued by the tasting menu, which sounds unusual, and didn’t contain any meat, just fish and vegetables. It was a wonderful experience, with flavours perfectly matched and everything cooked to perfection. Also portion sizes were perfect for the 7 courses we enjoyed: just enough to feel satisfied without being over-full. The matching wines were a great addition, and service was excellent throughout. Highly recommended."

Koka,50,Excellent tasting menu with friendly and efficient service,"Although dining alone I was made to feel extremely welcome with attentive, knowledgable and friendly service from all the staff.    I had the full tasting menu with wine pairing and all the food was beautifully presented and absolutely en pointe.    Hard to pick out a favourite course: the shrimp and langoustine dishes were brilliant. As was the cod.    Really pleasant evening with exquisite food: very highly recommended."

Koka,50,A tasting menu that delivers,"An experience starts with the first greeting. The team at Koka made me feel welcome from the start. Serene space with natural wood tones sets the mood. I had the 5 course meal which was plenty of food  The onion soup snack was an explosion of flavor to kick off the meal and the courses all surprised simple preparation with wonderful flavor surprises. The buckwheat with the cod, the slight spicy element if the shrimp dish and the umami explosion from the grilled cabbage and mushrooms    Highly recommend the wine pairing ."

Koka,50,A balanced experience,"After my disappointing dinner at another fine dining restaurant in Gothenburg Inhad very low expectations on KOKA. I was pleasantly prooven wrong. The meals were very balanced and there was a lot of care put in to the produce. Only one dish was not up to par (the kale) but kale is very hard to execute as it in its nature is very difficult to make malleable. The meal wasn’t revolutionary in any way, but it didn’t try to be. The restaurant steps away from the pretentious and focuses on the balance of the flavours and to create good memories for your pallet, not your Instagram. I applaud them for that!"

Koka,50,"Local, seasonal food, great wine, great service","Great food, seasonal, local, fresh and well made. Variety in ingredients was great, portion sizes were fitting, staff was pleasant but casual, wine was excellent."

Koka,50,Worth the hype,Totally worth it. The food was amazing and the wines lovely. The price is pretty darn low compared to other Michelin starred restaurants.

Koka,10,How can this be Michelin star worthy?,"Plant based menu: great  Wine parings: mediocre, apperitiv (spanish brut we chose) great, following white wine pairings OK at best  Courses: amuses great, first course of farmers menu good, second and third lacked flavour to be honest. Red beetroot and celeriac that followed (course 4 and 5 very good).    BUT. I had plastic in my 3rd course. A quite large piece from a packaging box (how?). I politely attended them. Response: NOTHING.    Sorry what? Nothing.    I’m a food enthousiast and wine lover. I’ve been in restaurants all over europe, US and Scandinavia, but never have been ignored if something was wrong. Sorry but this is a fatal flaw in your performance. There is nothing that says hospitality like showing you acknowledge your (un intended) error. Ignoring it…. I should have refused to pay to be honest. This is not worth a Michelin star appreciation. It is far below it’s hospitality standards in my opinion."

Koka,50,A top ten meal of our lifetime,"We have been fortunate to dine in some really fantastic restaurants, but none with a Michelin star. We were blown away by the flavors, atmosphere,"

Koka,50,Enjoyed Thoroughly,"Decor and ambiance was typically Swedish, stylish but simplistic. Food was really innovative and delicious. It was tasting menu and everything was just delicious right from starter to dessert. Wine pairing was too good."

Koka,50,Fine Dining in Laid Back Atmosphere,"It was our second visit at Koka, and we will definitely come back. The food was fantastic, the wine pairing matched perfectly, and the service was swift and attentive. And all this for a reasonable price for a Michelin star restaurant. All in all, 5 points, the maximum. Keep it up!"

Koka,30,Cool & good but not yum & wow,Like others who have given a 3 star... This place is nice but not wow... Neither the presentations nor the flavour. Its not the Michelin place you desperately want to come back to or forcefully recommend to your friends.    The host and staff were extremely good.  The baked portobello mushroom was the best dish for us and the two desserts kind of helped complete the evening on an overall good note.

Koka,50,Fine Dining with local attitude,"We took the seven-course menu and were not disappointed: Local dishes, each course an experience of its own. Nice wine selection possible, which we did not choose. Good service worth our tip.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with wooden interiour which generates a warm attitute. Strong recommendation, although not a real snip."

Koka,50,One Michelin star,"We tried the tonight’s menu and the taste was excellent, only the desert decor could be better. Wine pairing menu was good but not outstanding. The atmosphere was very friendly and also very flexible service. They did customize the menu for my son"

Koka,50,A must for gastro-explorers,"Very good food, varied and elegant tastes, using a surprising array of unfashionable ingredients in fantastic ways. Add great ambience, discreet and friendly service, plus very reasonable prices - and you will not hesitate to come back soon."

Koka,50,A superlative dining experience!,"For a gourmet experience you will not forget in a hurry, this restaurant is the perfect place.  We ordered the set dinner menu with the accompanying wine menu, and each dish was complimented perfectly by the, at times (it seemed to us) unusual selection of wines.  The waiting staff have found that rare and perfect balance between being attentive but not intrusive, and their knowledge of and passion for the food is both interesting and entertaining.  I cannot recommend this marvellous small restaurant highly enough."

Koka,40,Update wine list,We are a fan of food here. But same can not be said about wine list. Service is top quality.nice place.

Koka,50,Great food and good wine suggestions,Great food and good wine suggestions - fairly priced. We were a group of friends from Copenhagen. Very impressed with his mission in Starr restaurant and dairy prices great service and good atmosphere.

Operakallaren,50,Wonderful food with professional attention to detail,"This restaurant takes you to a bygone age.Service here led by William is beyond exceptional  On arrival there were warm smiles and I was escorted to the conservatory where Alexander offered a champagne trolley  They have everything from Dom to more tiny vineyards  I plumped for rose bubbles in a chilled glass.Utterly sumptuous.  All dietaries were noted and fully observed.  The canapes were exquisite.Without ruining the surprise the pea tart and foie gras spring roll were truly exceptional  I was ushered into the dining room which has the feel of a oak panelled library.  The crisp white table cloths and the glistening chandeliers give a feeling of grandeur and opulence.  A menu was brought by Lorenzo and it is divided into 3  A degustation menu,a smaller gourmet menu or a 3 course a la carte.  I cheated and made the 3 course 4 as I was tempted by the flambé Pineapple served with duck Foie Gras pistachio and a ginger and herb sauce.  Before this was a luscious egg served in.its shell with roe, anchovies and cream as the final canape!The breads were unbelievable with chicken skin and normal butter  The pike perch was my sneaky extra course which they gave me complementary a generous touch.  The main was melt in the mouth roe  served with morish celeriac,topped with fruit yummy!This was washed down with a silky smooth US cabernet.  Dessert was a pear and currant which only tells half the story again I will not spoil the surprise.  The bill came with some chocolate petit fours which were so delicious  The thing that elevates this to a higher level is the pulling out of every chair after a bathroom visit.The friendly and engaging service.  Yes it comes with a hefty price tag,but it is truly worth it when you have a seamless faultless evening  Greta , Amelia and Alessandra were just so empathetic and happy to see empty plates  An evening to remember which takes away any stress  I am so lucky to be able to have such a treat  Thank you to you all"

Operakallaren,50,An excellent fine dining experience at Stockholm,"We booked for dinner at this historic fine dining restaurant, minutes from our hotel,the Grand Hotel and next to the Opera house.    As you arrive you are ushered to the Veradah with a view of the Baltic and other famous sites of Stockholm and served exotic snacks with your drinks.    You are then ushered to the main dining room adorned in wooden  panels,chandeliers and steeped in history.    The dining options are explained. The food is exquisite and elegantly served very graciously and in style.    An experience well worth it!"

Operakallaren,50,Classic fine dining,Classic fine dining at its best. Excellent Dodd and service in a beautiful restaurant. Excellent wine pairing. Impressive wine list.

Operakallaren,50,Evening of classic elegance,"Classic French cuisine beautifully prepared is elegantly served in the 19th century space with tapestries, wood wainscoting, and a plethora of silver service trolleys. When one arrives one is shown to a table in the veranda with the Baltic in front, The Grand hotel to one side and the parliament on the other. Here is served several rounds of amouse which can be consumed with champagne, a cocktail, or soft drink. The one enters the gorgeous dining room. We took the ala carte menu which included roasted whole foie gras, lamb, delicious salmon. For dessert I opted for the cheese trolley with 15 Scandinavian choices; my companion had a perfectly made soufflé. For wine I chose a reasonably priced Ch Talbot 2016. A wonderful evening of classic elegance."

Operakallaren,50,Stockholm Opera cafe,"Outdoor cafe at entrance to Opera building. Pricey but food was delicious. Limited menu. The foyer of the opera house is worth a visit too. Painted ceilings, costumes for sale, grand entrance."

Operakallaren,50,Just perfect!,"From the moment that we arrived until we left after 4 hours, everything was just perfect. Lovely tasty beautiful food, great wine parings, fabulous friendly service. A really great experience!"

Operakallaren,50,Exquisite food with true fine dining service,"My visit to this restaurant was on the same night as a royal dinner given for the King and Queen of the Netherlands. I was interested to learn that the restaurant is the royal caterer--given the stunning presentation of the dishes as well as their creativity and flavor, I am not surprised. The service was impeccable. The dining room itself has beautiful woodwork and is the perfect location for a special dinner. My dinner here was a true highlight of my trip to Stockholm."

Operakallaren,50,Fantastic,"We had dinner here and the experience was truly magical. Needless to say, the food was exceptional. I was very happy to see how vegetarian friendly this place is. They have a very impressive wine list. The service was top notch, the staff was very efficient and yet warm. We made beautiful memories here. Thank you."

Operakallaren,50,"Outstanding, in every way","It was a wonderful evening, from start to finish. It ticked every box, so if you are looking for outstanding food, served in a grand dining room, with the best of “old world” service, this is your place!"

Operakallaren,50,Emblematic fine dining in Stockholm,"This is certainly one of the most beautiful dining rooms in the world!  From fin du siecle-days and still (mainly) preserverd in its full glory from 1898.  Top Swedish chefs has ruled this dining temple through the years: Tore Wretman and Werner Vögeli (both also the Swedish King's personal chefs) amongst others.    So, is the food under the present commander Viktor Westerlind up to par with the environment?  The simple answer is: YES!  Keeping the long entangled traditions, chef Viktor maneuvers through the clever menus with both a sense of the old and the new with responsive ingenuity.    An evening at Operakällaren starts on the indoor terrass with canapées and something to drink while you can study the menu options.    You are taken to your table in the magnificent room and the show begins...    Our five course degustation turned out to be 10-11 servings all in all, with three amuses to start with (and the canapées, the middle mini-intermezzo and mignardises to round it up).    What really impressed us was the ""build up"". How many times has one experienced great starters, but ended up with a small downfall at the main dish?  Not so here: flavours are builded up and are escalating. Intensity in taste and flavour goes up all the way through the dinner.  Great experience!    Having one the largest and most prestigious wine cellars in Scandinavia (and could probably be so in the whole of EU), choices for wines in the more moderate price segment are also available for us with limited budgets.  We had some bottles of excellent wine in more moderate price levels paired with the help of the sommelier.    Staff is kind, attentive (see below) and well informed. The general feeling is: fine dining, but relaxed. It's how it should be.    I give full five TA-points, no question about it (and I seldom do...).  However, some small remarks, being somewhat picky, but not really affecting the general ""verdict"" is:    • I got a dirty spoon. And had to ask for it to be replaced.  • The ""wine level observation"" of the guest's glasses could be better. Often we had to ask for a refill. Actually stupid, since the opposite would sell more wine...  • Napkins are removed when a guest leaves the table. But not replaced in several instances. Had to ask for new napkins.  • The lovely menu could very well have been printed on a ""mini menu"" available on the table during the meal. It's easy to forget what you really have been ordering...  • Asked for an Amaretto as an avec. Not available...    I would say the price level is more than fair. 155 EUR for an (in total) ten-eleven course meal on highest standard level must be considered as excellent.  The wide options of wine choices adds to this: no need to get ruined if you don't want to, so to speak.    Superb and very highly recommended!"

Operakallaren,50,Fantastic,"The experience begins as soon as you enter the room, one of the most impressive dining rooms I've visited. Two tasting menus and an la carte are available. Everything was perfectly cooked and well presented. Very enjoyable evening."

Operakallaren,50,The best restaurant experience ever.,"If you are looking for excellence, look no further, they got all you ever need, absolutely world-class."

Operakallaren,50,Classic fine dining at its best,"I visited Operakällaren for the second time last week, and I was amazed. If you want classic fine dining in a beautiful environment this is your best pick in Stockholm. To be fair, the food is far from the trendy innovative modern cuisine currently so popular in fine dining, but that does not matter when the food and wine is this delicious."

Operakallaren,50,Top class,We enjoy wonderful food in restaurants around the Sweden . This restaurant is top restaurant of its class.will be back again soon! Everyone in our group loved the food!

Operakallaren,50,Wonderful,this what i saw here never seen before in my whole life i thanks so much to know the kind of food even though was hard to me to eat.

Operakallaren,40,Operakällarens outdoor terrace,"What a rare pleasant surprise when the Brasserie next door chose to keep it closed.  A quick-footed example of trying something new when everything is different.We think it worked brilliantly when the historic Operakällaren lightens the style a bit and has an informal but oh so handsome outdoor seating.Beautiful linen on the table, nice glasses and cutlery and the kitchen is the same.But now autumn is here and it's time to crawl indoors. OP has no problem at all with distance between the tables, it's just normal furniture."

Operakallaren,50,Everything is top-top-notch,"It was my first visit to Operakällaren, but it certainly won't be my last! I've probably never eaten such an expensive meal before, but then again I've probably never eaten such amazing food before either. Each course was perfectly done and a real treat to the taste buds. The service was outstanding to say the least, I felt seen and pampered. Our waiter chose the perect wine for each meal. Eating at Operakällaren was so much more than a meal out, it was a whole wonderful experience."

Operakallaren,50,Great Service in a Unique Setting,"Great Service in a Unique Setting, the wood and and the decoration is beautiful. Great Wine list and Choice of Menus."

Operakallaren,50,Excellence and tradition with a friendly touch,"If you can accept the cost there is not much to complain about here. The home and cradle of fine dining in Sweden. Heavy with tradition but with great culinary competence and the most extensive and prestigious wine cellar in the country. The Christmas buffe is extensive, partly tasting menu, partly buffe. Excellent quality. Drink pairing available but is rather complicated for a buffe dinner why better select your own drinks. Outstanding service. Expensive but good value."

Operakallaren,50,Best Christmas Smörgåsbord in the World,"Always a great restaurant, beautiful inside and great views, but especially so at Christmas. The staff is the most professional and kind you can find!Tiny soup- lobster- bleak roe- heerings-different salmon-many warm dishes and a magnificent buffet with puddings. Make reservations! Look at the pictures!"

Operakallaren,50,Stockholm’s finest.,"Steffano Catenacci with staff has done it again. As the Stockholm restaurant scene is vastly improving - perhaps by the minute - thanks to innovative chefs who really make a great job in advancing the culinary art in the Swedish capital. Operakällaren is up there; leading and setting the pace in terms of customer care, outstanding food and decor.    There are many chefs who get more attention than Catenacci and the classic Operakällaren. Yes, there are many restaurants who make a great job with the overall experience. But no, Operakällaren is in my view the best in town when it comes to the overall experience.    There is no doubt that the food is outstanding, clearly worth a detour. Innovative, fantastic combinations, flavours and presentation - the best ingredients and produce. Does the quality hold the same high level day-after-day? I can’t tell, as I have only been twice in the last ten years, but there should be no reason to doubt, rather on the contrary as Catenacci has been a leading name in Swedish cooking for a good 20 years.    It is also highly appreciated that Steffano works the floor together with his highly professional staff - a true pleasure to watch the troops working the floor in a highly coordinated manner with meticulous attention to all details. From entering the restaurant to all 11 servings of different fantastic dishes and 9 servings of wine - all great matches.    Special mention to Christoffer, Sara and the staff working Friday Nov. 8. Attentive, interested, helpful and knowledgeable - totally outstanding throughout the entire five-hour experience we had during our dinner.    When in Stockholm and you want the best - your budget not being an issue - Operakällaren is the place to go. Bon appétit!"

Operakallaren,50,Amazing dinner,"What a wonderful surprise this evening was. We were expecting good food in a beautiful dining room but did not have overly high expectations. What was delivered to us was a fantastic journey of delicious courses accompanied by an amazing wine pairing.  We chose the 7 course menu and every course was packed with amazing flavors, not one felt short. Sensationally delicious and creative dishes that were accompanied by perfectly matched wines.  The chef was present throughout the evening, greeting guests and even serving certain dishes himself.  A very memorable evening and to me after Frantzén the best restaurant in Stockholm.  On our must-repeat list."

Operakallaren,50,An amazing thoroughly enjoyable evening.,"We have been fortunate enough to enjoy wonderful food in restaurants around the world. This restaurant has to be close to the top restaurant of its class. While our expectations were high, they were more than matched by the beautiful room, the extremely skilled and politely helpful staff and, of course the extraordinary food & matching wines served by people who obviously cared about the outcome of the experience for their guests.  I suggest that it is simply not possible to visit this restaurant and leave disappointed.  We would love to return and do it all again."

Operakallaren,50,Fine dining in style,"This is the place for dining if you want an exceptional treat in a historic setting:from the personal reception, allocation of table, waiters' perfect attention, innovative dishes like small pieces of art, accompanied by fact-full explanations of origin, cooking and name, to the escort from the table afterwards.. It was a symphony of tastes--some ten dishes I think--composed by the talented Chef du Cuisine,including some effect-full surprises between the main courses. The ambiance is exceptional."

Operakallaren,40,Beautiful restaurant with a long history,"This is a beautiful restaurant in the middle of the city with a long history. Highly recommended for a special occasion.  Greeted in the best way, all the way from the wardrobe to the table. A big selection of champagne by the glass, with good explanations from the sommelier. After this you will get some time to look at the menu.  We selected the Menu du Chef with wine pairing. A 5 course dinner, with several amuse bouches and pre-starters. A few were Iberico ham off the bone, thin bread with salmon and a canapé with truffle filling, Oyster with foam and cucumber pickle, Poached egg with cod roe.  The starter from the menu was seared scallops with cauliflower cream, pickled turnip and browned butter with a nice glass of Riesling.  Next course is Blackened turbot with miso, cream of beans, pickled black radish and a lemon beurre blanc served with Chardonnay.  Main is Fried fillet of lamb with baked celeriac, chanterelles, lamb sweetbread and lamb sauce with lavender. This was served with a glass of wonderful deep coloured red wine with a fantastic depth.  After some downtime, that was really needed, we continued with selection of cheese from the trolley, and here we got a small tasting menu of different wines to match the cheeses we chose. Menu ended with the dessert of blackberry semifreddo with almond cake, blackberry cream, ice cream and caramelised white chocolate, and served with a Tokaji wine. Between the courses we got some small palate cleansers.  The dinner will take some time so don’t be in a hurry if you come here, it is a full evening event. The service is very “correct”, just like in the old days, as expected from this type of restaurant."

Operakallaren,50,Awesome,We had the tasting me u with wine pairing. Outstanding food and service. Would highly recommend!!!!!

Operakallaren,50,Deserving of six starts: Flawless,"Without doubt, Operakallaren is simply the best restaurant I've had the pleasure of visiting in my life. I've been lucky enough to visit several Michelin-starred places on three continents, but this place was something else. The first highlight is the location - set in a 1787-era room that is all sumptuous wood panelling, frescoes and gilding, you feel that you're stepping back in time to another period. The food is simply incredible. Despite ordering a three course a la carte dinner, it actually turned into 8 courses, with the amazing amuse bouche and appetisers that accompany each course! The experience started with an appetiser of Iberico ham off the bone carved at the table with a canape of Vasterbotten cheese and truffle, with pickled mushroom, and another of yoghurt with salmon. This was followed by another appetiser; this time a lightly poached Normandy oyster with a foam, served in the shell. Followed by more delights from the kitchen; a hen's egg very lightly poached with crisp potato vermicelli on top and cod roe. Next was bread - the offering included an amazing potato flour bap with cheese. Gorgeous. All this before we even had entree! We both chose the scallop - which was a Norwegian variety, huge compared to scallops from elsewhere and beautifully prepared. My main was the lamb, which was carved by chef at table and was to die for, accompanied by celeriac puree. My wife had the pike perch and pronounced it excellent. Following the mains was a palate cleanser of meringue topped with lemon and raspberry sorbet and pickled lingonberries with cream. I chose the chocolate cream for dessert. This was followed by a further two dishes; some mini marshmallows in coffee and strawberry flavour - with a tiny flame to toast them over! Finally finishing with petit fours.  The whole experience occurred over almost three hours; this is not just a meal, it's an experience that you'll remember for a long time. There is not only cuisine, but theatre as well - in short, Operakallaren deserves more than five Tripadvisor starts and it sure as hell deserves more than one Michelin star."

Operakallaren,50,Always Amazing,Operakallaren has been around for a long time. And deservedly so. The setting is majestic. The service is flawless. The food is divine. The staff is friendly but professional. I had the most wonderful foie gras appetizer. More impressive was the rhubarb semifreddo for dessert. Don't miss this fine dining experience.

Operakallaren,30,Not as good as expected,The food was good but not excellent. The service around the food was excellent but for the wine quite disappointing. We also had to wait a very long time for the bill which also was with errors.

Operakallaren,50,Delicious food and perfect wine pairings!,"Lovely evening with incredible food, attentive but not intrusive service, impeccable wine list and opulent period interior. We had the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing and we weren't disappointed. The staff is extremely knowledgeable. We were treated with a few bonus courses which were also delicious. This restaurant is worth its Michelin star. We will return!"

Operakallaren,50,Faultless,Highly recommend. Absolutely faultless. Food was beautiful and paired with incredible wine! Staff were extremely friendly and chef was very refreshingly engaging!! One of my top 5!

Operakallaren,20,Disappointing after all the good write ups,"Operakallaren features in a lot of restaurant lists for Stockholm, but we found it a big disappointment. An authentic but a bit outlived interior, traditional but very basic dishes, fish soup not served warm, etc Not worth the good reviews we saw, not worth the visit. Would confirm you in your believe if you had a bad, basic idea about the Swedish cuisine (which I don't). Much better restaurants in the neighbourhood."

Operakallaren,50,One if our top favorites in Stockholm,Each visit to Stockholm this little gem is a must for us Always a warm welcome Always good food and wine The guys here know their wines so we always leave them to choose for us and to take us on new journeys and this time we were given top tips for other restos to visit during our stay One which was SMAK which we tried on our last nite in Stockholm What a perfect end to a perfect holiday Looking foward to our next visit :):):)

Operakallaren,50,Delivers every time🙌🏼,"I really enjoy dining at Operakällaren.    The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive!    The food is always impeccable and the wine list is amazing!    Ask the personnel for a tour of the wine cellar which is fantastic!    Even if you choose to only have a three course meal you end up having close to 10servings which adds to the experience. This however means it is quite time consuming, so make sure not to be in a rush.    The champagne selection they offer by the glass is amongst the largest in Sweden.    The ambiance is very nice!    I warmly recommend if you’re ever in stockholm and want to enjoy a great Michelin star experience!"

Operakallaren,50,Heavenly,Fantastic old world ambiance with attentive service and a lovely pace to the meal. The fish is superb and well crafted and of course the mashed potatoes are a specialty. Deserts particulary woth a mention too

Operakallaren,50,Beautiful experience!,"The restaurant is beautiful, the location, the ambiance, the interior decor of the building, all around amazing.    The food also, ordering the tasting menu but getting all the in between dishes, making the experience a feast for eyes, mouth and stomach! Ordering champagne from the cart and then them filling it up when they see your glasses are low, and just keeping you continuously at ease and happy throughout your full meal.    You can see that they team working here really love cuisine, food and the art of cooking and entertaining their guests.    Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to go out for a special occasion meal, experience and/or enjoy great food!"

Operakallaren,50,"Sexy, posh & expensive restaurant","My husband and I were invited here by one of his clients, so the atmosphere was business-like at the same time, pleasant. The location of this restaurant is very good. One notes immediately at these people aim for excellence and to please. The service was efficient. The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean. The food was great,,3 course meal created by Stefano Catenacci, and selected wines complimented the dinner perfectly. One of the best views in Stockholm while you eat. Thank you!"

Operakallaren,50,Perfection,"We have never had a better restaurant experience anywhere in the world. First the restaurant is in a beautiful space. The tables, the staff, the food has the formality that you want in a great meal but without stiffness.We had the 3 course dinner but we actually we given 12 small offerings...5 chefs treats before dinner served beautifully, a pre-dessert before dessert, and 3 rounds of treats after dessert. There was one special cream puff only served on shrove Tuesday ,the day we were there. The food was delightfully complex with intense flavors and beautiful presentation ,some with fire. All were small but satisfying. The staff could not have been more accommodating and responsive. Best experience in Stockholm. Wonderful."

Operakallaren,50,This restaurant has by far the most beautiful dining room in Stockholm,"This restaurant is situated at the nice park” Kungsträdgården” and is a part of the Stockholm Opera building as you can tell from their name. Traditionally it was the most famous restaurant in Stockholm. It has had its ups and downs, but now it is again a good one-star restaurant. Then you arrive you is always welcomed by very nice young people in the cloakroom.  Then you are directed to you table you can hope to be placed in the extremely beautiful dining room and not what was once outside the wall. The last place is quite OK, but nothing compared to the dining-room. The dining room has a very high ceiling and very nice wood carvings both on the walls and in the celling. However, it is the many beautiful paintings that makes you really marvel. It is just one thing that irritates, some interior decorator has placed some very big mirrors on the floor, I cannot imagine why. It is a large and quite room which is a real advantage these days.  Then menu consist of different combinations of dishes, from a traditional three course dinner and up. You also got several small taste bits, both a couple of pre-starters, an oyster and a pre-dessert desert, all of them very nice. We picked a three-course dinner. My wife started with scallops and I with a ravioli with foie grass and truffles. They were both very tiny, beautifully served and delicious. We had the same main dish, dear. The meat was just perfect, but the vegetables was more of a decoration then a complement. We had preferred twice as much, which would hade been more propionate. Our desert, the blue berry parfait was perfect and contained a lot of chocolate. We also got some march mellows to roast and nice chocolate pralines before we left. In total a very nice dinner that made you satisfied but not over satisfied.  The wine list is probably best in Stockholm, it is a clear advantage to having been in business well over a hundred years. The alternative by glass was also much larger than normal.  The staff was polite and correct, but not that personal or talkative. They had a very clear masculine dominance as well as the guests.  I can really recommend this restaurant especially for those who want to eat and talk and have very nice things to look at."

Operakallaren,50,Traditional but Very Good,Operakallaren is an institution that’s made a marvelous comeback. Amazing environment and food really tops the nouveau Swedish kitchen. Spend the money and enjoy!

Operakallaren,50,Best meatball,Went here as it had good reviews and we were looking for best authentic meatballs. And it didn’t disappoint me at all. It was the best meatball I ever tried. Will go back just for the meatball itself. The location is perfect. We sat outside and the ambience was great and the server were very efficient. We have to wait a while to get seated but was worth it.

Operakallaren,50,Amazing!,"Sophisticated French inspired restaurant with a remarkable menu. Very good food and outstanding environment, or let us put it this way, it is magnificent! High level service as well. Definitely worth a visit if you are In Stockholm and looking for a gourmet experience in town."

Operakallaren,50,Supreme experience in the most classical gastronomic restaurant,"We had the chance to book a table. It was in my intention to visit this place for the last 20 years since I discovered them when they were doing the Julbord in Brussels.    The dinner was just at the top of classical gastronomy. Service attentive and with all the classical attribute of kindness, attention to details, and ""decoupage"" of duck, wine serving...    Wine, even tough expensive in Sweden where of a great variety (took degustation menu with wines) and at profusion.    A great moment, No regrets but be prepared to pay 200+ euros per person.    Visit this place, you will not regret."

Operakallaren,50,Really good Restaurant!,"The environment Here is really good and the service was excellent! Having the food you can, you just enjoy it!"

Operakallaren,50,FANTASTIC Christmas Buffet,This place serves incredible christmas buffe! I love the atmosphere of this place and the staff is nice and very nice!

Geranium,50,Genius,"Having been slightly disappointed in Noma a couple of years ago I was eager to see what this restaurant was all about. Well it’s definitely unique. Based on the 8th floor of a complex which houses the national football stadium for a start.  Once you get out of the lift though you enter a very light and well considered room. Everything very, well, Skandi.  Calmness prevails but there is also a warmness about the place which is carried throughout by the excellent waiting staff.  So the menu itself is about twenty something small bite sized dishes. Obviously if you have an allergy or don’t like an ingredient they just substitute it. Very importantly it is a meat free menu. Now I must admit I hadn’t realised that and it may have impacted on whether I came.    I have to say the lack of meat didn’t reduce my enjoyment one bit. In fact I came away feeling nicely full and very satisfied.  That’s all down to the quality and innovation of the dishes.  Everything was just so immaculate, well constructed and beautifully presented.  It worked so well as a collective.  Now we had the basic wine pairing but there are 4 options as well as just by the glass/bottle.  Some excellent and interesting wines. I was a bit concerned when a Pinot noir appeared given no meat but it worked very well with the turbot.  Obviously it’s not for the faint hearted as far as emptying the wallet goes but it’s a wonderful and special experience.    I think at Noma we felt like part of somebody else’s experiment where as here we felt the experiment was done especially for us."

Geranium,50,YOLO Dining,"What is there to say about Geranium that hasn’t been said? If you’re on the fence about going, get off the fence and go. We had a marvelous experience all around.    The food is interesting, with things you wouldn’t think to eat combined in a way you wouldn’t expect. It is elevated but not inaccessible, especially once the dishes are explained. The service is warm and friendly. We never felt out of place or like we shouldn’t be there.    It was very cool to tour the wine cellar and kitchens between the savory and dessert courses. The energy in the front and back kitchens was collegial. It’s definitely a place that could feel competitive or high pressure. Instead, it felt like everyone genuinely wanted to be there and enjoyed it —not something to you get in every workplace.    Overall, if you’re into once in a lifetime experiences in a global city with outstanding cuisine, this should be your stop."

Geranium,50,Still wonderful,"Geranium is a beautiful restaurant with an incredible wine list, and a pleasant atmosphere that allows for an enjoyable conversation. The service is spotless. Geranium is one of the best restaurants in Denmark. I had the pleasure to dine at Geranium few years ago and it seems as if it didn't change much. Unlike most restaurants, I find Geranium unique in that it is suitable for different purposes, family gathering, friends get together or business dinner (as long as you don't mind a long dinner)."

Geranium,50,The perfect restaurant,When planning my trip to Denmark I decided to book in advance a table here after researching a few options in Copenhagen  Michelin Guide. The place didn't disappoint! Food was pretty laid back but extremely tasty - the chefs manage to give a special and unique touch to every single dish .

Geranium,50,Amazing!,"We were so lucky that our hotel managed to get us a reservation at this restaurant the week before we visited Copenhagen. It lived up to its reputation in terms of presentation, textures and flavours all with no meat which was a refreshing change for us. The service was fantastic by coincidence the Sommelier came from a neighbouring village in Oxfordshire. An unforgettable experience, although the cost is eye watering."

Geranium,50,Truly exceptional dinner with a few suggestions to make your experience even better,"This is a truly amazing experience. The food, the presentations and the people. Special big thanks to Jackie the wine expert who was not only a true expert but also a great, genuine and friendly person.  Although i did give 5 stars because the restaurant deserves it, here are a few points for improvement :  1. The espresso was truly undrinkable. Sorry. They make a whole fuss of it with hand-held machines at your table but the espresso is so sour that it is really undrinkable. Guys- for such an amazing place, do something about your coffee !  2. Be prepared for this exceptional dinner, it is not for everyone : ALL dishes are miniature size that you finish in two bites. This is not a problem with amount of food (-you will not get out hungry, there are enough ""bites"") but you will not be able to ""linger' on a main course or something more substantial. We did not mind so much but be aware.  3. The price is exceptionally high. Around 500 Euro's without drinks. I understand that this kind of dinner is expensive to make (not to mention the exceptional service and personnel) but judge for yourself if this worths the expense. Especially annoying is the pricing of their wines which is on the high side even comparing to other restaurants in Copenhagen. Be aware. Their non-alcoholic arrangement of exceptional juices is also extremely expensive at 250 Euro per person. Again- i am not saying it is overpriced because the amount of labor invested in it is amazing, but still- a lot of money..."

Geranium,50,Best Sommelier ever,"Fabulous restaurant, deserves all their accolades. Food was amazing but what made it a truly unique experience was the phenomenal wine list and the people who created and served it. Soren is of course the best but also - and especially- Jackie, who was incredibly knowledgeable and so generous. Jackie made our dinner so very special - thank you!!    (And to anyone who plans going there - don’t skimp on the wine, either do their pairings or try individual selections guided by the team)."

Geranium,50,Amazing Experience at the World’s Best Restaurant,"We had an unforgettable experience at Geranium, which fully deserves its title as the number one restaurant in the world. We planned our visit to Copenhagen three months in advance to secure a table, and we were not disappointed. The dishes served were not only beautiful and delicately prepared but tasted unique and delicious. The only dish that fell short of our expectations was the white piece Dark chocolate and Jerusalem artichoke dessert. However, all the other dishes exceeded our expectations in terms of flavor and texture. We also opted for the non-alcoholic package, which was outstanding. The juice flavors were delicious and perfectly complemented the meals. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, describing each meal in detail and making the experience even more enjoyable. As native Spanish speakers, it was great to have a Spanish chef explain some of the dishes and show us around the restaurant. Overall, our experience at Geranium was wonderful indeed, and we would love to revisit this place when they have a new menu."

Geranium,50,Each bite is an edible piece of art,"First, the (not so easy) logistics: Geranium is among the highest in-demand places in Copenhagen (along with Alchemist), and deservedly so... Booking a table here takes some perseverance, patience, and skill. The slots for a specific date open 3 months in advance, and you can reserve a table through their website.    Assuming you've managed to secure a spot, you will be rewarded. Every bite showing up on the table throughout the evening was art in an edible form, and the flavors were simply unmatched. The Geranium team somehow managed to amplify the natural beauty of each ingredient in a stunning presentation. So I am not at all surprised that they retained their 3 stars in the 2023 Michelin guide.    The team is super friendly and welcoming. At the same time, the service to me felt a little less polished compared to a few other places (the already mentioned Alchemist being my personal golden standard for a perfectly choreographed meal). Outside of that, it was a perfect night.    All in all, definitely worth it. This place would be a great choice for a special event, celebration, or a(n elevated) date night."

Geranium,50,I need 6 stars,"I got a plane a Friday morning for a business meeting up at Copenhagen. Geranium was the restaurant where we had the meeting while enjoying such a delightful, joyful menu. Flavours are reconstructed in a way that once you close your mouth, a cumulus of sensations start building what I call ""the miracle"".  If you have the opportunity to book, do not hesitate."

Geranium,40,Perfect delicious food,"So... why not 5/5? Because for a 3 Michelin restaurant I would have expected that the attention to detail towards food and service would also carry over to the staff's uniforms. Call me a stickler, but for a 3-star restaurant I would expect the uniforms to be impeccable. This was not so: One pair of pants was visibly worn around the buckle, one female staff member's outfit was dirty (clearly she sat down on something), one male staff member's jacket was dirty around the chest pocket, and one female staff member's outfit was poorly cut to a point where I wish the restaurant would accommodate folks from all backgrounds, genders and sizes. Having had my rant, now to the good part of the evening...    Food and wine were amazing. Every bite served (except for one that felt bland – see photos) was delicious. The attention to detail was astounding and the seasoning absolutely perfect. Most notable was the squid dish, although again, the meal was truly perfect. Wines were excellent, but of course came with the corresponding price point. Service was impeccable and the space simple, yet modern.    Overall it was a wonderful night. I wish I had had the chance to briefly meet the staff to thank them for the great experience. Will be back."

Geranium,50,Number 1 for a reason,"We went just before it became the number one restaurant in the world. It is beyond spectacular. The ingredients, the taste and textures, the flavours. Just incredible and totally worth the cost. It is an experience that you will not forget"

Geranium,50,Pure art and class,"After going the day before at Alchemist, it was time for a dive in pure artistic gastronomy and classy atmosphere. Each dish was a masterpiece, both in presentation and in terms of taste experience. Everything was perfect and the service is outstanding. A must go once in a lifetime for every gastronomic fan. It's worth doing the pairing with alcohol and non-alcohol at the same time, different and enjoyable experience"

Geranium,50,Very delicate works of art on your plate.,"Best ranked restaurant in the World at the moment. I don’t know if that is true, but for sure it is the Best Restaurant I attended in years (and we really are used to eat in toprestaurants). The dishes were not only exceptionally tasty, they also looked beautiful. Very delicate works of art on your plate. Surprising flavor combinations where each ingredient has its added value and where you distinguish all the flavours. In any of the 17 dishes you recognize delicate craftsmanship and pure flavors. We went for the newer wines and were pleasantly surprised time and again by a very good selection. The adjusted non-alcoholic package was also completely matched and delicious. The staff noticed everything, were always available, but most of all were also conversational and brought serenity. Almost 5 hours at the table and not bored for a second. Fantastic also that we got a tour behind the scenes: every staff member had a smile on their face. And that wasn't forced. Both in dining room, and kitchen, you just see passionate people who go the extra mile to give you the time of your life. Is it expensive? Yes sure it is. But worth every penny."

Geranium,40,Inventive Cuisine Experience with Some Ups and Downs,"Geranium is a restaurant in Copenhagen that is well known for its inventive cuisine and has three Michelin stars. My experience at the restaurant was mixed.    The appetizers and savoury dishes were impressive and outstanding, but unfortunately, the desserts were a bit disappointing. Among the savoury dishes, the ""Abstract of king crab"" and ""Tuber Melanosporum with cauliflower"" stood out. However, the Monkfish did not seem to fit in with the rest of the menu.    The sweet dishes were nice, but not as impressive as the savoury ones. The mignardises, in particular, were a bit of a letdown. Additionally, the amount of food served was on the lighter side.    The staff was not as welcoming as other Michelin-starred restaurants I've been to, such as Frantzen, Zen, or Jordnaer.    The wine cellar is impressive, but the prices are steep. So, if you're on a budget, it's best to be careful about the wine selection.    In summary, Geranium is a very good restaurant, but it did not live up to my expectations entirely. If you're in Copenhagen and looking for an innovative and inventive cuisine experience, it's worth trying to get a table Geranium. However, it may not be the best choice for those who are looking for a more welcoming and traditional Michelin-starred dining experience."

Geranium,50,Absolute splendour,"Wow! The most magnificent dining experience for my sons 21st birthday. The food was exceptional, wine list impeccable, service outstanding! The entire evening was splendid & they treated us like the only ones in the room. The 18 courses (caviar extra) of fish & vegetables were beautiful, delicious, inventive & perfect. The attention to detail was breathtaking. It was art on a plate & an incredible theatre. The whole team were welcoming, friendly and extremely professional. There’s a reason it’s the best restaurant in the world, it deserves its reputation & every one of its stars. Honoured to have been there. Cannot praise, recommend or thank them enough. A night we will never forget."

Geranium,50,"Excellent food, Excellent service","There's a reason this restaurant is currently ranked as Best in the World. The food is excellent, the service is impeccable, and the entire evening was truly an experience. I have a food allergy, and the restaurant graciously accommodated me. We opted against the wine pairing in favor of wine by the bottle, and the excellent sommelier was able to provide great advice when selecting from the 200+ page wine menu. I'm so glad to have had this once-in-a-lifetime experience!"

Geranium,50,Excellent Experience,"My wife and I had lunch here on a Friday. It’s expensive but its reputation is well-deserved.    I placed the reservation very early. It looked like lunches were easier to book than dinners and Friday lunches were easier to book than Saturday. Tables for two were harder to get than tables for four.    Food was very innovative and almost too pretty to eat. Attention to detail regarding presentation is second to none. There was one dish we thought was average. Everything else was excellent to perfect.    Service was friendly and professional. The sommelier/Red Sox fan was very helpful. The meal was well paced and lasted about three hours.    Prior to the dessert courses you can take a tour of the wine cellar and the facilities. It was very interesting and a nice break between courses.    We purchased a bottle of wine and some individual drinks. We ordered sherry for our last round and were surprised that they only carried one brand. I was expecting a list of 5-10 by the glass. Sherry must not be popular in Copenhagen but I still find it odd for a restaurant that has a wine list the size of a dictionary,    Not sure if it’s the best restaurant in the world but they make a compelling argument."

Geranium,50,5* service,"We visited Geranium in April 2022 in what was a delayed trip for my partner's 'big' birthday. We were scheduled for February but had to re-arrange due to Covid. The restaurant is set in a bright, airy space attached to the national football stadium. The view overlooks a park and is a serene, relaxing environment. The Spring Universe Menu was a delight from start to finish, local produce with interesting flavour combinations, perfectly balanced and served at a perfect pace. We were lucky to get an extra course in the form of some cake for the birthday boy and to sample our first Danish wine. Part way through lunch the food stopped for a tour of the restaurant which was a nice touch. The wine cellar was amazing and the staff kitchen and dining area as nice as the restaurant! Service was impeccable from the talented and friendly bunch of international staff. It truly was a special experience and we were delighted to see them awarded best restaurant in the world just a couple of months later."

Geranium,20,"Geranium, not up to 3-stars","Easygoing friendly service. A little too busy dining area with the preparatory kitchen in it. Obviously great dishes, but too skimpy. Leaving Geranium, having spent €1200 per couple we were hungry. Not ok having had lunch at what is supposed to be the #1 3-star restaurant in the world. There was no sequence of dishes amounting to a summit, and the balance between appetizers, salty courses and deserts were unbalanced with too much emphasis on deserts. Arriving there, we were still hungry, and we are not big eaters. Hope the chefs rise to ghe challenge and offer a sequence not only beautiful and interesting but actually worth the quite extortionate price Geranium cost."

Geranium,50,One of World’s Best Restaurants,"Geranium provides an excellent dining experience. We dined here on prior visits to Copenhagen and twice during our July 2022 stay. The food is the best anywhere, the service excellent and the wine list second to none. Thank you to everybody at Geranium for these wonderful dining experiences!"

Geranium,50,Simply PERFECT,"We had lunch for a birthday celebration and the menu was called the Summer Universe with 19 courses.  We did not take the wine tasting but followed the recommendation of the sommelier and ordered different bottles of wine.  Everything was perfect from the place, the staff, the wines and of course the menu. Every dishes were unique, intriguing, surprising. Every details were thought through from the choice of ingredients to the presentation in the plate. And all that in a very friendly atmosphere.    The pros  The food!!!!! Exceptionally creative and some unique taste never experienced before.  The wines recommended by our Australian sommelier. Each bottle was not only exceptional (especially the white wines) but also at decent prices (and the wine list had crazy expensive bottles),  The staff, very friendly and professional, from all nationality speaking English, french, Spanish.  The place, with large windows, view on the plating area.    The cons  The disappointment of not being able to thank the Chef Rasmus Kofoed directly as he was gone when we finished our lunch."

Geranium,50,The premier table in Copenhagen,"On the list of 50 best restaurants Geranium and Noma should change places.  Geranium has the immediacy (umiddelbarthed) and friendliness of its relaxed staff that Noma had in the early days, which greatly increases the enjoyment of the meal.  Every dish was 3-star quality.  During the meal we were brought a revised 99 page wine list since one item had been sold out. Four wine pairing alternatives with excellent choices and no oddities.  We still chose a bottle of champagne and one bottle of white based on excellent advice by our sommelier, the assistant restaurant manager. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."

Geranium,50,Nordic dream,"Nordic in every fiber, it makes me proud to taste the extensions of our age-old heritage, in these culinary fireworks for my tongue"

Geranium,50,Truly (and expensive) amazing experience,"Well deserved 3 Michelin Stars and world’s best 2nd position.  Honest and sophisticated cuisine, although meat has been completely removed, and fish is minimal, so vegetarian and vegans delight.  Despite not being vegetarian the whole experience was a top one. Be prepared to pay minimum of Euro 600 with wines, but worth the experience.  Nastasia the sommelier was great with us, and all staff very attentive."

Geranium,40,Fading Memories,"I can't say we didn't enjoy the food, and we definitely had professional and friendly service (although this was also the case in other restaurants in Copenhagen). When we left the restaurant after the meal, we felt satisfied. After all, we'd eaten in what's currently the second best restaurant in the world, and since winners are no longer included in the list, it's perhaps not unlikely that Geranium will top the San Pellegrino 50 Best in 2022. In any case, the experience was pleasant. But the very next day, I began to have doubts. What struck me was that most of the dishes turned out to be quite forgettable and the whole experience didn't leave any longer lasting impressions. I've had the opportunity to dine in some famous restaurants, such as Osteria Francescana, El Celler de Can Rocca and many others of similar quality. Compared to those restaurants (as well as some that were never in the top 3 to my knowledge), the food here wasn't so spectacular. This may be due to the new menu, which is limited to vegetables and seafood, but the very idea of serving 21 small courses (even the part of the tasting menu corresponding to main courses was mostly bite-sized) has its drawbacks. It's hard to focus on such a sequence of dishes and appreciate the better ones when they're gone after 2 bites. Usually at these top restaurants, even if you don't love the whole tasting menu, there are courses that are so great, delicious or clever that you have them as a reference point for future experiences (even at a restaurant like Eleven Madison Park, which I did not love, one or two courses would qualify). None of the dishes we ate at Geranium are in the same league as, say, the 5 ages of parmesan at Osteria. It seems as if the restaurant considers, for example, the ""flower"" dish with yellow beetroot as a signature dish of this menu, but in fact the vegetable cut as a flower isn't original, and even if the dish teaches you that you can do a lot with beetroot, that doesn't necessarily mean that it was the tastiest thing in the world. If you think about the entire menu, you suddenly notice that almost all (if not all) dishes were served cold or at room temperature. When we did the usual tour of the kitchen, no cooking seemed to be taking place. So there were no temperature contrasts or other signs of great cooking technique. This must've made life a lot easier for the chefs, but is that what 3-star cooking is all about? Then there's the presentation - yes, most of the dishes look good, but if you think about why, it's because of 2-3 repeated tricks. The first, as you might expect, is the use of flowers arranged with tweezers, the second the cutting of vegetables to resemble petals, and the third a kind of 'lattice' pattern baked in intricate shapes and placed on top of the main ingredients. All are attractive at first glance, but ultimately quite ordinary and easy to achieve. Although for me the food is above all other factors, I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the location and the decor. Again, neither is bad, but the offices of the FC Copenhagen football stadium and the area in which they're located aren't the most breathtaking and the interior, although bright and comfortable (the tables are large, the spacing between tables is excellent), is less impressive than in many other places. At a price approaching Parisian 3-star territory (but at least there portions are larger and many luxury ingredients are used), you shouldn't even talk about value for money. I chose the standard wine pairing, which was again OK, but not spectacular. At Celler de Can Rocca, I had the impression that the wines must've been made specifically for the courses served (or vice versa). Here, such a communion between wine and food wasn't even remotely in sight. Do I regret going? No, because I like fine dining and want to be able to form my own opinion. Would I recommend it to someone who's not interested in the latest foodie awards, lists, etc., but just wants to have a phenomenal meal, no matter what the cost? No, I'm afraid I wouldn't."

Geranium,50,Absolutely amazing,"Absolutely amazing! From the greeting in the front door, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the design, the outstanding service till the toilets- the whole package was so perfectly made. If you ever get the chance to experience this restaurant, go for it."

Geranium,50,Top Restaurant,Outstanding service and food. We went for the full autumn menu with heart and soil wine pairing. Generous glasses of wine. Nicely matched. Marbled Hake was something very special.

Geranium,50,Perfectly executed,A pleasure to visit Geranium and experience what can only be defined as perfection. It’s perfect raw materials executed perfectly with a light touch. Simply beautiful to look at the plates and delicious to eat. Unlike some of his contemporaries in Copenhagen- there is nothing that will shock or challenge you- it’s a very gentle and elegant place to eat - I keep using the word perfect as it’s the only one I think sums the experience up. The wine list is phenomenal and my advice would be to go for your own bottles as opposed to the wine pairing as truly there is sooooo much to choose from. The space is serene and calm - yet very casual in its vibe which is great. The service just impeccable….  What a lovely lunch we had - look forward to returning!

Geranium,50,Should have been #1,"From the reception at the base of the football stadion to the little farewell gift the service is immaculate, young, diverse and international. There is little more to say about the food, clean, fresh, surprising and beautifully presented with passion. The wine list is spectacular and they offer 4 options for paired wines. For the first time ever was I tempted to take one of those but in the end a Riesling from Klaus Peter Keller and a bottle of chateau rayas were more tempting. Difficult to compare with other great three stars in the world because the food is so unique and different. Maybe Central in Lima is the closest because that is differently unique. Comes at 3 star pricing but that is a given."

Geranium,50,Fabulous Dining Experience!,"Geranium has three Michelin stars. Dining there was a wonderful culinary experience: the atmosphere, food and service were each deserving of three stars. The food was spectacular and Alex, our waiter, was pleasant and always helpful. The wine list, too, was excellent. We will return to Copenhagen to dine at Geranium."

Geranium,50,Unique experience,Three michelin stars for a reason . An absolutely great dinner. Very expensive but deserve every single euro . Great service great view

Geranium,50,The perfect experience,"This was our first visit to a Michelin restaurant and I had no idea what to expect - I was even nervous a bit because I am pregnant and therefore somewhat restricted in my diet. I am not sure there are words to describe the experience !  From arrival to the end the service was superb. All staff members were excellent and what really impressed me was the communication between them. Everyone seemed to know all about us, our choices and our evening. Wow !  The food itself was marvellous and quite filling ! You can clearly see the amount of passion that goes into every dish.  While my partner went for the wine pairing, I chose their non-alcoholic juice pairing and I think that was the best part of the night for both of us. The spectacle of making my drinks and then their taste was amazing. I had no idea juice can be this fancy !!!  We loved it and we are considering going back. Two days later and I am still under the spell of the experience. Really well done everyone in the team !"

Ta Vie,50,Depends on how you expect,"Excellent for the food, but the point is that it seems that Italian and Japanese rather than French & Japanese especially what the pasta shows. On the other, their English level is enough to offer the service and help consumers solving any kind of issues, but I hope that next time when I come they can show that they have already improved their English. However, good for anything and will go there again as a customer rather than a teacher."

Ta Vie,10,Horrible & Greedy,"The place is just a joke, when I make the reservation we have told the table would available on either at 6pm or 8 pm, that means we have left our table after an hour and half?  Their standard 8 course menu is HK$2,980 + 10% services charges = not less $3,300 per head i.e. something around GBP350.  Not sure how a mitchelin 3 star restaurant would offer such a rush & greedy dining experience.     Whether or not we would ever go with this less than 2 hours 8 course £350 Michelin restaurant? Well… there has a lot of excellent restaurants would allow reasonable timing for the customers, and I would consider them first. "

Ta Vie,30,A night to remember or not,"It has been a long time since I have done any reviews because of Covid and I honestly got lazy.  But now that life has been restored to normality I thought I owe it to myself and everyone to write a review.  I hope I am not making anyone angry by giving Ta Vie a rating of 3. I would actually have given it a 3.8 if I could, but I did not want to round it up to 4 for reasons I shall explain.  First kudos to where it deserves, the communication from the moment of booking till the date of the meal was great.  The bread served was fantastic. The actual courses served was also good but not exceptional.  However, given the price point of this restaurant I was expecting the server / maitre d' to ask us how the food was given that my guest had left a good portion of the main course untouched. I just wanted to share my views with the maitre d' or server about why the food was not finished, but I was never given the chance.  In most restaurants (in particular in restaurants of this caliber) I would get asked about how the food was or why it was not finished either at the time when the plates are cleared or at the end of the meal when I ask for the bill. But this did not happen.  I was just presented with the bill and a very polite good bye given.  Some might argue that I should just share my views non the less at the end when asking for the bill despite not being asked, but I did not want to do this in front of my guest.  My experience even in much lesser restaurants with a far far lower price point I would be asked how my food was when the plates are cleared, let alone uneaten. But no such enquiry was made by the staff.  Some might question me as nit picking...perhaps I am, but when the meal cost over HKD3000 per person (dinner menu) a bit more scrutiny is applied.  I cannot say I am not satisfied with the food, but was I wowed? Was it worth the HKD 3000 per head? I leave this as an open question for others to answer."

Ta Vie,40,Overprice for the whole experience,"We booked a dinner to celebrate my birthday here at Ta Vie. It is a two stars restaurant.  The first starter is Aburi lightly torched Aori squid, grilled avocado with French Oscietra caviar. I and my daughter think this is a disaster as the avocado overpowered caviar and three items together do not have any connection elements.  The second starter is much better and I give it a perfect score which is Lobster and Japanese turnip warm salad , turnip leaf oil, Stilton sauce, fresh apple, the lobster is perfectly cook and match perfectly with turnip leaf oil.  Next corse is House made pasta with Aonori seaweed sauce topped with Hokkaido fresh Uni, this course is perfectly cook but not extraordinary in term of taste.  The first main course is charcoal grilled Kinmedai with crispy scales. This one is extraordinary and heavenly.  The second main course is charcoal grilled wagyu beef ribeyes smoked with Hoba leaf arima pepper sauce. The wagu beef is a bit chewy and the steak knife is not sharp enough. The desert is Pistachio tart which is not ok. The taste of pistachio not balancing good enough with mandarin. The final desert is much better which name winter forest with chocolate, whisky, dates, pu'er tea which is well balance.  To end the dining experience, u can chose tea, herbal tea and coffee, i recommend coffee or tea instead of herbal tea. All of this come with little treats like chocolate mousse with coffee, Pina cotta with herbal tea etc. This is a perfect ending.  Overall the dinning experience is like riding roller coaster. From soso to excellent and then good to soso and very good again.  With the high price tag 330USD+10%. I am expecting a perfect dinning experience with only 10% fail room. Therfore I can only give it a four stars.    Service is extraordinary, unfortunately the setting of restaurants is not up to date. It need renovation due to current HK situation. Dinner always move to lunch time. This is unacceptable to charge this price with this dated setting."

Ta Vie,50,Well deserve its 2-star status...,"This French restaurant is managed by chef Hideaki Sato and has been awarded Michelin 2-star status. Located in The Pottinger Hong Kong, we came on the Boxing Day for lunch, as the dinner service is not available with the government's current restriction measures on social gathering.    Greeted warmly, we were shown to our table. The décor is very comfortable and relaxing, cleverly using live plants and details on the decoration and setting to create a cozy ambience. I like how the dated texture of the wooden floorboards and cabinet giving me a feel of visiting a place with history.    We ordered the special Winter Festive Season Menu ($2,180 each), with me also going for the wine pairing ($1,280). The restaurant also offers a wide range of wine, as well as sake too. Even the bottled natural water Azumino ($88) is special, coming from Nagano in Japan.    The first course is 'Crab House Sandwich'. Very interesting on the presentation, the crispy buckwheat crepe has a crab shape, and underneath is Hokkaido kegani (horsehair) crab salad. The crab meat is very delicious, and together with avocado, tomato, thin radish slices and a nice dressing which blends all the flavors together, with a perfect acidity to make this a wonderful starter of the meal. The wine paired is Paul Bara Reserve Brut Champagne NV with the crisp acidity refreshing and complimentary.    The second course is Duck Consommé. The delicate yet intense soup is certainly mind-blowingly delicious, and there are also house-made ravioli contained duck meat, as well as a poached oyster from Hokkaido Akkeshi of silky texture. The flavors are further enriched by the black truffle strips on top. The wine paired is Famille Plageoles Vin de Voile 2008, with the oxidative aromas and taste matching well with the consommé.    The third course is Deep-fried Lung Guang Chicken Wing. A signature of the restaurant, the chicken wing has the bone removed and then stuffed with Jpanaese burdock and white truffle rice, before deep-fried to give a crispy skin. Underneath are some pea sprout which is right in season, and added with an intense Shaoxing wine sauce. With a few shaves of truffle on top, this is another great dish which is a must-try in my opinion. The wine paired is Domaine de Montille Beaune 1er Cru Greves 2015. The earthy notes are a good match with sauce.    The fourth course is Pan Seared Langoustine. Another of my favorites, the langoustine is wrapped with a thin puff pastry to reminiscent of a crispy edible shell. The langoustine itself is very good, fresh and very tasty, great in both appearance and flavors. There are also the seasonal parsnips which added a different texture to the dish. The wine paired is a wine from Yamanashi, Adega d'Arvga Bosque 2017 made from local variety Koshu with good mineral notes to match with the langoustine.    The fifth course is Wagyu Beef 'Rossini', with a piece of nice Nozaki Wagyu beef as well as a piece of foie gras wrapped in a brioche, paired with red wine sauce and some black truffle. Both of us always are shy of the fatty meat, but I found it amazing that both the beef and foie gras did not show any oiliness, simply perfect on how they are cooked. Wonderfully done, the wine paired is also beautiful, with the 1995 Clos du Marquis offering a nice savory development to the dish.    Before transitioning to dessert, we are given a cup of home-made hibiscus beverage, which helps to cleanse the palate. It is very refreshing and I wonder whether the chef can share the recipe as I want to make this at home as it is so good.    The sixth course is Fresh Japanaese Pear 'Le Lectier', with a sponge cake soaked with pear liqueur on the bottom, with the fresh and juicy pear on top, on top with a fresh cheese ice-cream and beautiful garnish. A piece of art, it also delivers on the flavors, with the pear liqueur strong but balanced with the sweetness from the ice-cream, and the delicate of the pear is not suppressed interestingly. The wine paired is spirit from Capovilla Distillati, using Decio di Belfiore apples.    With an Indonesia Coffee (dripped by French press) to wrap up, the restaurant also provided a chocolate mousse dessert to pair which is highly complementary. A very good meal, and the portion size is also appropriate, making us full but not overly so, enabling us to really savor all the dishes to the complete extent.    The service is very good, with the staff attentive to our needs without asking and able to remain 'invisible' most of the times to allow a good privacy on the conversations. Chef Hideaki Sato also came to introduce a couple of dishes himself, and both of us were amazed by his young and handsome look. Definitely the quality of a celebrity chef.    The bill was $6,301 which is a bit expensive but considering the quality of the food, the choice of wines, and the overall dining experience, I would say it is worth the price tag. As chef Hideaki Sato personally written on the menu, his motto is 'pure, simple, seasonal' and I truly can relate to that through his dishes. It is one of the most pleasant meals I had for a while and for that, I wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant."

Ta Vie,50,Fantastic French cuisine,"Sampled Ta Vie’s four course lunch. It is not surprising that every course was prepared to well perfection. Surprisingly, their home made bread, butter and cheese were so nice that we couldn’t control ourselves to finish them all albeit fatty concern. Ta Vie’s Michelin star rating is well derserved."

Ta Vie,40,An Ordinary 2-Star Michelin Restaurant,"My friend and I grabbed the chance to try out Ta Vie’s lunch menu during restaurant week. The dining experience was very ordinary, which didn’t quite match up with its 2 Michelin stars.    My friend and I are huge bread lovers. These warm house bread got our heart with their crispy crust and fluffy bread. Second round of sourdough was great too.    I chose this Foie gras and dried figs terrine as appetizer. The foie gras was great, not too stuffy nor heavy, probably because of the refreshing figs sauce layers in between. The peanut butter on figs was a nice surprise that went well with the foie gras and figs.    Second dish was this House made pasta with “Aonori” topped with Hokkaido “Bafun” uni. The sea urchi was so fresh and sweet, very delightful. The seaweed was so refreshing. A delicious dish indeed.    Main course was Roasted French milk fed veal from Burgundy. The seasoned turnip and potato pieces were actually more attractive than the veal itself. The veal was really ordinary…    The overall dining experience was okay, and the food was great, but not up to our expectations of a Michelin 2-star restaurant. Luckily we got a deal from restaurant week to try out this lunch menu without feeling really ripped off."

Ta Vie,30,Business lunch,Set menu with 4 courses for lunch. The food is barely impressive but the service is definitely unprofessional. The waitresses are interrupting and presenting the dishes or the bread and the cutlery from both sides. The dishes are explained in an annoying and not appetizing manner.

Ta Vie,30,Desserts were good,"I was invited to a birthday dinner at Ta Vie. Due to some prior engagements, I only joined for desserts, cakes and drinks.    All my friends had the tasting menu which included 2 desserts. Both of them, especially mont blanc with Pu’er tea ice-cream, were good. The melon birthday cake looked really nice and was delicious too."

Ta Vie,50,Love it,"I went there for my birthday celebration and due to some personal problems, I had to change my booking a few times and thanks to Ms Takano San, who had been very accommodating and patient with our email communication.    It was a tasty meal with a price tag on the high side. However, after taking into account the exquisiteness and seasonality of the ingredients used and the detailed and meticulous cooking, I think the money was well spent.    IMHO, the food tasted more on the Japanese side i.e. the flavour was more pure and simple to pay homage to the ingredients and was less complicated or as strong as the French cuisine. Both my son and I appreciated such subtlety.    Service was impeccable with genuine hospitality. To my pleasant surprise, Chef Sato served two of the eight courses to the table personally.    The dining experience was delightful and it's an enjoyable evening. Don't expect anything gimmicky. It's just about savoring the natural and original taste of the food.    I will definitely return as it doesn't hurt once in a while to splurge on a special occasion."

Ta Vie,50,Special Occasion Meal,"Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday....walked out feeling very satisfied.    Highlights: Caesar salad topped with Hotaru squid, grilled Hokki clam with Taiwanese bamboo shoot, and roasted Aveyron lamb.    We did the wine pairing and thought it was good (wheat bear, sweet sake, sherry)....but probably not worth the price tag."

Ta Vie,50,Fantastic experience,"Awesome restaurant, French cuisine from Japanese Chef, very attentive service and delicous food. Beautiful desserts."

Ta Vie,40,Let’s start the journey,"Being ranked #16 on Asia’s top 50 with 2 Michelin stars, Chef Sato did not disappoint. We had the Winter Special menu and it was a delightful culinary journey. Every course was delicately plated and the taste was good. His signature dish “Braised abalone covered with abalone shell” was indeed memorable. We could see the Chef’s great attention to details in everything. Even the water they served was one of a kind from Japan. After the delicious champagne, we also tried a bottle of lovely Japanese white wine made with Japanese grapes. Service was friendly and attentive. The intimate dining room was very cozy. Chef Sato came to say goodbye when we left and it was a very nice touch.    I only wish there were no truffle and caviar. These two expensive ingredients are so overly used by Michelin star chefs nowadays in their dishes, I found these ingredients with such a strong character only made something special less special."

Ta Vie,50,Extraordinary Meal,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at Ta Vie. We enjoyed it immensely. Everything from the food to the ambience to the service to the attitude. All hit the right spots. First, we sat down - they stagger arrivals so that even with just two or so wait staff, no one feels unattended. The pacing and quality of the food is extraordinary. Every dish flows from the next - innovative without being gimmicky. I cannot recommend this highly enough to anyone seeking a romantic evening"

Ta Vie,50,Great place to dine,1 Michelin star French – Japanese fine dining. Is now one of my favorite fine dining restaurants. The food is excellent – the right balance of traditional and creative. Dishes are inspiring / unexpected but are executed well. Every dish from amuse bouche to desserts were fantastic. Strongly recommend.    Service was very welcoming.

Ta Vie,50,Expensive but quality food and very friendly setvide,"Went there for our anniversary after going there for business lunches and dinner and the missus felt left out!    The service was warm and very good for Hong Kong. The food was excellent - if you like fresh ingredients cooked in a way that squeezes out the natural flavours in a subtle and non-overpowering way then this is for you!    We had the crab starter - one of the best I’ve had in Hong Kong where the meat was fresh and very sweet. The avocado was delicious too. The soup was earthy and paired well with the onsen egg. And their signature dish the pasta uni in a seaweed sauce was as expected - tasting the sea!    The aubergine showed off the freshness and quality of the ingredients but one of the highlights for me was the fish and especially the crispy skin which was off the charts! For those of you who like abalone, this fish was extremely flavourful with the abalone liver sauce and an edible ‘shell’. I found the wagyu beef average not because it wasn’t well cooked or melt in your mouth, but more because the other dishes were so special!    Another highlight was the first dessert of lotus, jasmine and banana. Just when you thought the banana was too overpowering, the taste of the lotus kicks and then it ends with the banana coming through again. Very subtle and fresh and interesting! The last fish was pure fusion - ice cream with crunchy goji berries and salted egg yolk!    The bill came to $3,500 each which is expensive but we did go for the wine pairing option and ordered extra white truffles. Not cheap but definitely one of the better restaurants in Hong Kong if the quality of the food and subtlety of the cooking is top priority!"

Ta Vie,30,Exquisite ingredients with a steep price tag,"Expect dishes with exquisite ingredients that you would not easily get anywhere else (see attached menu and dish photos), and the service was good Japanese standard - polite, but not overly warm.    However, come equipped with a thick wallet. All in all, we felt that we overpaid despite the expensive ingredients and that you can get a better deal at other fine dining places. The bill came to ~HK$ 5500 for two persons for the tasting menu (you can't choose, it's set), two aperitifs and our own bottle of wine (corkage fee HK$ 500).    We were happy with most dishes, the ones that stood out positively were the refreshing crab and the wagyu beef which was melt-on-your-tongue tender. We were disappointed with the pasta and uni as it was overcooked, which you clearly wouldn't expect at such an exquisite place. The signature dish, abalone, was well presented but I didn't perceive it as excellent as its praise. The rest of the dishes met expectations."

Ta Vie,40,"excellent Japanese fusion, but a bit too pricey","We went for dinner spontaneously and without much expectations. The menu was predefined, so nothing to decide - just sit down and enjoy.  The atmosphere was nice and relaxed and the service good. Each course was explained well. The only thing that took me by surprise was that the first course came more or less with the apéritif.  The food was exquisite. The crab-jelly (first course) and the beef (last main course) were outstanding. The only thing I would change would be to swap the abalone with something else, as I find abalone in general quite uninteresting and chewy. I realise though that this is just personal preference - the dish was prepared well.  All in all, a very nice experience, however on the pricey side, even for fine dining."

Ta Vie,50,"Pure, Simple and Seasonal!","Visited Ta Vie, leaving me a pleasant French-Japanese fine dining experience. 2 stars!  Caesar salad, refresh your palate with crispy lettuce and the Hotaru squid add texture and umami flavour to the dish. It gave a good start to the meal.  Clam chowder, creamy soup. There was a sweetness from the peas that against the salty clam. Wonderful!  Chef special: Sea urchin pasta with seaweed. Strong umami flavour when combined with seaweed. A taste of sea!  Burrata cheese, rich and creamy dish. White strawberry, beetroot and tomato (sweet and sour) are to cut the heaviness from the cheese.  Abalone, it cooked to perfection, top mark for the presentation. Abalone shell I thoughts just a normal shell for decoration but actually is a cookie (eatable). Amazing!  Langoustine, light and simple dish. It just slightly cooked, remain texture in the middle. The broth bring more flavour to the langoustine.  Beef tongue stew, strong earthy flavour from the morel, made the dish full and rich. The beef tongue was so tender.  Both dessert are really good, especially the Almond ice cream covered candy glass (Really appealing). Overall meet my expectation! The taste of the food really impress me."

Ta Vie,50,Ta vie is all class; an exquisite and memorable dining experience.,"Ta vie has a leased space on the second floor of The Pottinger Hotel; it is not difficult to locate if you use the hotel as your guide. The moment you enter the restaurant it exudes class, elegance and serenity. The staff (of many nationalities) efficiently and quietly usher you to your table (booking is essential); quickly take your water order and present menus even though we were experiencing a 9 course set degustation menu; it is always nice to know what you are eating even if it is not patently obvious. Each dish was a work of art, unusual and often quite complicated but all were very tasty. Our menu was based on seafood and we enjoyed scallop, sea urchin, snow crab, fish, abalone and lobster. The wine list was excellent and it was easy to find wines to match the food. Little add ins like the iced Oolong tea to cleanse the palate and the sea urchin dish added to the experience; even the bread and butter were made in house and were excellent. Although the dishes were small and quite exquisite we had plenty to eat. It was quite expensive but you got what you paid for. Being quite a complicated meal the staff were often at the table changing cutlery etc.; they were most unobtrusive. It was a memorable meal."

Ta Vie,50,French with a Japanese twist,"I have been a fan of Chef Hideaki Sato at his previous place. So I thought I have to try his own establishment after I heard about it.    This time, it's no longer traditional Japanese, but rather modern French with some influence from Japanese cuisine. The food was amazing, we all enjoyed very much and the service was superb. Although some could argue that a bit more creativity or character would make the dishes more outstanding.    Other than the wine pairing, there is tea pairing which seems very interesting and great for people who doesn't drink.    Overall I think it's a great place, slightly pricy but justifiable with the ingredients used."

Ta Vie,50,Very delicate dishes,"We went there as a group of five and had a great dinner. The dishes were delicate and good taste. We ordered a bottle of wine with about HKD2500 per head in the end, which I feel a bit on the high side but I would love to bring my wife here for anniversary type of special occasion."

Ta Vie,40,"Good services and good food, can use less expensive ingredient for a different menu selection","I went with my friend to celebrate her special occasion. It is a fixed menu priced at 1,888, a price above average fine dining so I was really looking forward to it. It came with no disappointment. The chef, has fused Japanese ingredients in his French cooking. Taste are carefully planned throughout and we have an enjoyable meal after all. For example, the burrata cheese with fresh tomato is superb; the beef tongue is absoluteIy tender and melt into your mouth! I can also understand why it is priced that way, the ingredients are expensive, including lobster and abalone (one of the chef's signature dish), both are ridiculous expensive nowadays. When thinking about it, inexpensive ingredients can also cook extremely well, there is really no need to consume the more expensive one unless necessary, and the restaurant can design a lower priced course for average consumers. Honestly, if it wasn't a special occasion with my friend we may think twice looking at the price tag. With wine the whole meal cost over 4,500, not something average consumer could afford. Last but not the least, must try the dinner roll, it is so nice that the chef has a half page write up about it ""Yeast meet west""!"

Ta Vie,50,Well worth a try,"Located on the 2nd floor of Pottinger Hotel in Central, it is by far the best choice among the three restaurants the hotel offers. It is staffed with Japanese chef and Japanese waitresses. We had Tasting Menu. In fact, I believe this is the only choice for every guest. Bottled water is from Nagano, Japan. All dishes were meticulously prepared. The chef used fresh, seasonal ingredients which were flavourful. Our dinner experience was very pleasant and enjoyable."

Ta Vie,40,Genius Japanese Chef in Hong Kong,"Ta Vie is definitely one of my finest food experience in the past few months. This time I was here for Valentine's day. The menu indeed is quite pricey but given the quality of the food I don't think I can complain. The menu has been nicely decorated and presented.     First dish: squid tartare with caviar, uni and avocado. The squid itself is a little fishy but mixing everything together you won't notice the fishiness.     Second dish was an oyster with duck consomme and black truffles. This is pretty good and the duck consomme was really tasty.     Third dish: mussels with artichoke salad. The beauty of this dish is that the shell of the mustard is actually made my potato (that black thing) which is quite creative and interesting. Appreciate the effort!    Fourth: a Japanese crab meat risotto. Quite tasty and it's done just right, not too rich.     Fifth: their signature abalone dish. Similar to the mussel dish, the ""shell"" is kind of a handmade pastry. The sauce is quite rich and buttery. Quite good.     Sixth: Blue lobster, very nicely done. The lobster meat is actually quite soft in the middle. The dressing is quite refreshing too!    Seventh: the wagyu smoked with leaf. Wagyu can never go wrong. If you screw up wagyu you're a terrible cook. Certainly not going to happen here.     Dessert was a rose, raspberry and red dragon fruit mix with vanilla sorbet. Very tasty and certainly very Valentine!     Overall a very good experience and the staff were indeed quite detailed while most of them were actually Japanese. Nevertheless I suggest them to work on the interval between different courses as it can be a little inconsistent which caused to wait for some of the courses too be exceptionally long. One could argue it's over priced, and it probably is, but I personally would still come again as most ""artistic"" fine dinning places looks good but doesn't taste good, this place actually has both."

Ta Vie,50,Consistently excellent,"From music and decor to service, everything to enjoy. Food, of course, is the star. Dishes in the 8 course meal are delicate, creative and delicious, mostly seafood and vegetables: very hard to find a favorite. And they are served at a perfect rythm. You can certainly find similar gems elsewhere at a lower price, but for Hong Kong is a very good value."

Ta Vie,50,Excellent choice & Exceptional experience!,"OMG, what an exceptional way of celebrating Christmas' Eve in Ta Vie! Excellent food quality and high standard of service... ambience is awesome too, I love every dish I have, particularly the cheese and beetroot /white strawberry, I wanted to make the reservation for next year already... in fact I should take my parents here for a tasting menu😊... The chef is very young, talented and very friendly, Highly recommended!!"

Ta Vie,50,Really amazing dining experience,Went to this amazing tasting menu with my wife which is located in the Central district. The dishes I really loved here was the Sweet Corn Mousse served with Botan Shrimp.

Ta Vie,30,Average,"I have heard about this restaurant from my friend and eventually I have a try their lunch with my girlfriend, she had regular set lunch and I went for tasting lunch menu, menu price is reasonable but I would like expected more both service and food from a 2 starred Michelin restaurant, it was not a busy lunch service but I have to raise up my hands twice to have my wine refilled, food was average.  I hope they will improve it as I will have a business dinner meeting next month there."

Ta Vie,50,"There are many very good restaurants in Hong Kong, but only one Ta Vie","Ta Vie offers everything you want to for an exceptional dining experience; superb food, superb service and a superb wine list; with very well chosen wines to complement Chef Hideaki Sato beautifully prepared dishes. Ta Vie offers a 8 course fixed menu and occasionally adds another course, if the chef see's something he would like customers to experience that day, The quality of service and the knowledge of the staff is what you would expect from restaurants of the highest quality, as is the interior design of the restaurant itself. One the the very best evenings we have ever had, anywhere in the world; Its not cheap, but then again quality of the highest level seldom is.  Cheers"

Ta Vie,50,Excellent food and service!,"Came here for our wedding anniversary. Service was excellent and staff made my night a memorable one. Set menu was excellent, unique and modern style of cooking and with high quality ingredients. Even Chef Sato came out and wished us happy anniversary!"

Ta Vie,50,Excellent restaurant. One of the best in HK,Amazing food. Each dish is unique with excellent ingredients. The staff is friendly and helpful. Chef Sato even came out at the end of the meal and talked to me. One of the best meals that I had in Hong Kong.

Ta Vie,50,Fine dining and an absolute pleasure,"Modern, stylish, elegant. Service is formal, but not at all austere. You feel welcome, but very special. Chef is highly skilled. Menu is about subtle innovation with the balance of flavours and textures, the best ingredients and attention to detail. Amongst the elite of HK."

Ta Vie,40,Fine tasting for a stylish night out,"This was the second time I've visited this restaurant of chef Hideaki Sato.... and in my opinion he's a genius! This high quality mix of east and west is just.... marvellous!!!    There is only one menu to choose from, but it's all in balance, so no heavy 7 courses....    If you are in HK, visit this gem, and if you have the budget to spare.    It can be chilly inside, so take a coat or sweater, one remark though; on the booking the hostess requested if we had any allergies, and to be fair, I told her I'm very sensitive for lactose; I'm not going to die .... but still...,    Her response was, we can't take that in account, this is the menu.....    I have to say, it's Michelin star restaurant and it was a week in advance....    But I decided to go anyway and I took medicine in advance.... so all worked out, but it is a bit disappointing.....    Enjoy this experience!    DVE"

Ta Vie,50,Perfect match of the East and the West,"My first tea pairing experience starts from here! It is certainly a great pleasure to taste premium tea in wine glasses and have it paired with creative French cuisine prepared with best ingredients from Japan.    Everything is so tasty here! Apart from using very high quality seafood, meat and fruit from Japan, the chef uses different cooking techniques from French, Italian and Chinese kitchen to make the perfect blend of the East and the West. Each dish is an artwork in itself. This is a must-try restaurant."

Ta Vie,50,"Great Produce, Great Flavours and Great Presentation","Nicely appointed restaurant featuring dark colors and wooden features.    Welcoming and pleasant staff attended to all needs and happy to discuss the dishes and food and wine in general.    Some excellent produce was used to create flavorful dishes that were presented nicely, although some were more than nice!    Only 1 dish did not work for me but apart from that everything was good.    The menu changes seasonally so I would be happy to go back and see what's new!"

Ta Vie,50,Birthday Dinner,"Ta Vie is one of the best service restaurant that I have experienced. Though the restaurant is not really big but the environment and atmosphere is nice and comfort. Their home made bread and butter is so nice and fresh, their recommended wine is amazing, follow by the cold soup feels like swimming in the sea, refreshing and relaxing, the main dish is perfect, what surprised us is the birthday cake, is a season melon with the cake inside, you can tell that the Chef have put so much effort on the food, the staffs are gorgeous, thx for their excellent service and food 👍"

Ta Vie,10,Unexpectedly appalling experience,"It was my first time visiting Ta Vie and I was so looking forward to it given its reputation and its michelin-2 stars rating. My parents are also regulars there.    When I first sat down, I have specified and stressed to the servers there that I cannot consume any raw food due to my health concerns. The waitress was very helpful explaining how the food can be served in a well-cooked way after checking with the chef. However, it was a complete shock to me when the following incidents happened:    1. I was told all the dishes/ food can be served well-cooked. However, mid-way while I was eating the Caesar salad, the texture of the dressing reminded me that it might have raw egg in it. I quickly inquired with the waitress and was completely shocked to find out that she had to ask the chef again and THERE WAS RAW EGG IN THE DRESSING. This is certainly not what I expected from a Michelin-2 star rated restaurant where chefs and servers are not well communicated on what kind of ingredients are being used in the dishes and food being served. This incident can cause detrimental effect to my health and this is absolutely unacceptable coming from such a highly rated restaurant with staff having no concerns at all to their patrons. There were no sincere apology and compensation either.    2. We have requested another round of round white bread rolls but the waiter has served us another kind of sliced rye square bread. When we asked the waiter why it was not the round bread rolls which we had earlier, he explained that it was the same type of bread roll but just cut differently. Without mentioning the texture of the bread, anyone with proper eye sight can tell even the colors of the 2 breads are different. It is truly unbelievable that a staff from a Micheline 2 star rated restaurant is such poorly trained even with such basic bread knowledge (note that bread is even served before the first dish and this already gave us such a bad impression from the beginning of our dining experience), which left us all in complete shock and huge disappointment.    I don't think I need to stress again how appaling this whole dining experience was and there is definitely no coming-back, no referrals and only unpleasant comments from me on this restaurant."

Ta Vie,10,Bad attitude from the Japanese waitress and bad food,"the oyster was tasting awful, I couldn't sleep after the dinner, my friend is vegetarian and asks for vege option, they don't have, but give that face I don't care. When I call for refund or apology after I paid the dinner. they still don't care, and never said sorry. and said go ahead, after being to all top restuarants in HK in last 10 years, this is most aweful place I have ever been."

Ta Vie,50,Japanese french,"Location is Pottinger hotel, not Stone street hotel    Western style setting, with japanese/french fusion food cooked by japanese chef    Only 1 degustation menu and no a la carte    The homemade bread and butter were very good    The sweet corn ""soup"" is ok, but smells a trifle too fishy for me due to the shrimp. The oyster with wagyu was so somewhat underwhelming. The clam chowder was smart by adding sweet and snow peas. Then the chef suddenly appeared and served a dish not on the menu - uni pasta. It was delicious. The burata cheese salad and abalone dishes were very good too. The main of pigeon is good and a little too undercooked for my liking. The dessert ""tart"" is actually deconstructed , and with a meringue shaped like a butterfly with esquisite details. Best dish of the night and hard act to folllow. And indeed, 2nd dessert of caramelised banana therefore was just ok    The matcha served at the end in a bowl was super traditional and thick    Service seemed patchy. The japanese maitre'd knows what she's doing. The junior staff less so. And they don't clear the bread crumbs off the table till much later    Not a big fan of overeating, a la carte option would have been nice    Overall excellent, but a little expensive at HK2,244 including bottled water and a glass of sake"

Ta Vie,50,"Clever and artful, yet simple and true","My wife and I have been thinking of dining at Ta Vie for some time now. It finally came to fruition when we decided to celebrate her birthday there recently.    The restaurant is tucked away in the second floor of a boutique hotel, The Pottinger. Ta Vie is understated yet elegant in its furnishings. More importantly, unlike most restaurants in Hong Kong, there is ample room between tables to allow one to sit back and focus on the dining experience.    Michelin starred Chef Hideaki Sato’s culinary philosophy was clearly expressed in three words in his own handwriting on the evening’s menu: Pure, Simple, Seasonal. No doubt, the Eight-Course Tasting Menu featuring Asian products personified this mindset. Since we were in a celebratory mood, we also went for the drink pairing.    As the evening unfolded, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we were to enjoy four of Chef Sato’s signature dishes: sweet corn puffed mousse with Aburi Botan Shrip in shrimp consommé jelly (cleverly presented as a sunny side up egg) paired with a Japanese white wine, Aruga Bosque Koshyu 2014 (fragrant, bright, and dry – just what one needs to get the palate primed for the dinner); a poached oyster wrapped with Wagyu beef with grated celeriac jelly (entitled, “Surrealism” – clearly an unexpected juxtaposition of cooked shellfish with raw Wagyu, but it worked!) with a bold, crisp sake, Hakurakusei Jyunmai Ginjo; a surprise additional course of premium Hokkaido uni sitting atop house made pasta with a fresh (not dried, mind you!) Ao Nori seaweed sauce to be enjoyed with a Japanese craft beer, Kawaba Snow Weizen (subtle, could have been stronger and fuller-bodied); and a braised abalone covered with an edible shell (as it turns out, it was a biscuit) helped down with a refreshing chilled fresh Pu’erh tea, from China.    In addition, Chef Sato offered a crafty portrayal of “Clam Chowder” with whelk Matsubu twist clam and peas presented with broth poured out of whelk shells at the table accompanied by a Chinese chardonnay, Tasya’s Reserve 2011 (somewhat pungent, earthy tones that slowly grows on you); a Physalis, apricot and tomato salad tossed with Thai basil dressing on Burrata cheese supported by a Pouilly Fume Indigene 2014; and the penultimate dish (before the two desserts) charcoal grilled pigeon with rosemary smoke and sesame oil (beautiful presentation with the ceremonial lifting of the glass cover to unleash the smoke) paired with a Chinese red wine, the Summit 2014 / Silver HIgts (supposedly one of the better wines from China but in my opinion not quite ready for the main stage; it tried to suggest a Bourdeaux profile, but came up short like a young Rioja; a French pairing would have been better).    Not to be forgotten are the housemade Nakazuke-inspired sourdough bread and day-fresh cultured butter. We were asked if we cared for more, and we each quickly responded in the affirmative, resulting in prompt replenishments – three times each.    For dessert, we were served two: an artfully presented “Tarte au citron” with a butterfly meringue, lemon cream, and fruit tarte, quickly followed by caramelized baby banana with passion fruit crepe and black truffle sauce. The caramelized banana was paired with a white rum from Chalong Bay, Phuket, Thailand but, unfortunately, it overpowered the dessert with its pungent and spicy profile; I was hoping for the classic rum flavors: sweet, fruity, perhaps floral, to complement the caramel.    A couple more observations: Ta Vie’s excellent service – from the email correspondence to initiate and confirm the reservation, the warm welcome, the careful introductions in English to each dish, and the attentiveness - replenishing a drink to offering more bread and butter; and the unassuming Chef Sato, himself – throughout the evening, he would come out occasionally to check on the dishes as they were being presented to the patrons and he made it a point to meet and thank personally each departing guest (even indulging them for an autograph or photo).    The above 5-rating was for the excellent cuisine; the drink pairing, however, has some ways to go."

Ta Vie,50,Sublime culinary experience,"Attended a set gourmet dinner in which Chef Hideako Sato ( 2 Michelin stars) had invited his Spanish colleague Josean Alija of Nerua ( In Bilbao and 1 Michelin star), and both proposed a very interesting and well balanced menu, full of each Chef´s flavours and inspiration.    The service and knowledge of the staff was impecable down to the last detail, as could be expected in a restaurant of this category, as was the quality of the food and the presentation.    What I found that definitely for me stood out in an evening in which my high expectations had been matched food wise, was the most unusual but certainly very very interesting and revealing wine pairing.    Each dish was accompanied by a wine, from champagne, to white wines and reds. The Japanese Albariño was a revelation, as was the chardonnay. The Chinese red wine was fully embodied, albeit with a very discrete 13.5% alcohol volume. All the others, mostly from Japan, were completely unknown to me ( my fault), but perfectly balanced with the food and ambiance.    It is an excellent dining experience, one of the best one can have at this level in Hong Kong, where there is certainly no shortage of possibilities for fine dining."

Ta Vie,50,Japanese fusion star restaurant,"Had the most wonderful dinner.    Ambience: small place, only a few tables. They had a private party a separate room, but they were quite noisy so we moved the other side of the corner of the room    Wine list: features unsual choices from China, as well as traditional famous sake    Food: EXCELLENT! Being Japanese fusion food, means that even with 9 courses you don't feel too sick after eating ( as oppose to eating too much cheese in western food..) They choose seasonal ingredients from Japan. The menu changes more frequently in spring, but less so in winter and autumn. For example, our menu today features strawberries from Japan ( in season) and Shirako ( cod milt: not every one's cup of tea, but it was a cooked and seasoned version which was really good) and small squids. The chef really put a lot of thought into the menu as a whole, making sure you have different tastes and texture    Cost: not cheap, but that is what is to be expected of fine dining. Set menu each night, require credit card guarantee when booking. Worlth a visit for special occasions!"

Ta Vie,50,Destined to be a Michelin 3 star,"It's just a matter of time.    As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we felt the elegance. And yet, the decor was detailed, welcoming and very comfortable.    The service, right from the start, was world-class. We were confident that we would be well taken care of. Indeed, we were not disappointed. While the attention we received was professional and thorough, there was not a hint of intrusiveness. They are there all the time, but they are not there (for you to notice).    We were here as a family get-together. But if you were to bring business associates/clients, you might have sealed the deal before the first dish arrives.    The ingredients were of extremely high quality and fresh. The choices of ingredients were innovative with the perfect balance of taste and texture. The attention to details was captivating and refined. We had to take our time to explore and savour. Each dish had its own unique way of bringing on a new experience. Each dish also challenged us to wanting more and guess what would be the next to come.    While we will continue to talk about our experience in this restaurant, we look forward to seeing the M-3 star, and to brag: ""we told you so""."

Ta Vie,50,Under-rated Japanese French Fusion Restaurant in Central HK,"It was my surprise birthday dinner arranged by my boyfriend. He asked me if I like French food, and I told him I actually prefer something lighter, maybe Japanese.    He did his research and saw some good reviews of Ta Vie, so he booked a week in advance as there were only about 20 seatings in total.    I have to say this is the best fusion meal I had, in an elegant restaurant setting, and fine Japanese hospitality.    I was impressed by the creativity of the food in terms of taste and presentations. It is not overly fancy (some over-rated restaurants only focus on the presentation and neglect the taste), and the chef has done a very great job in balancing between his Japanese root and his trainings learnt from the 3 Michelin star French master.    Very authentic creativity, even telling us a story about the chef's childhood of Karamura snow domes in Japan with his beautiful dessert.    Highly recommend! (Book a week ahead and check their menu. I have requested to skip beef, and they have replaced it with a special scallop dish which is great)."

Caprice (Central),50,Perfect lunch,"I hadn’t been to Caprice for about a year and almost forgot how good it’s.    Since I was on my own and had plenty of time, I opted for a 5-course lunch. All dishes were sublime in taste and exquisite in presentation. It’s hard to name a favourite since I loved them all.    However, I must say Caprice makes what I consider the best Western style pigeon dish in town. No matter how the poultry is cooked, it’s always perfectly executed. Cherry clafoutis with cherry amaretto sorbet and yoghurt mousse was surprisingly good and refreshing.    The service was as impeccable as it’s subtle. I as a solo diner was very much at ease during my 2.5-hour meal. Although the French manager Victor and Chrissy no longer work there (Victor had left the restaurant and Chrissy had been transferred to Lung King Heen), Kelvin and Larry took very good care of me.    I won’t wait long to return."

Caprice (Central),40,This place has improved significantly,Came here for a special celebration dinner. I have to say that it was MUCH better than our previous visits and this place and improved significantly recently. On previous visits we found it very average but this time was impressive. Staff are so nice and genuine (big improvement) and the food was pretty decent too. Room had a nice vibe. We enjoyed the evening.

Caprice (Central),40,Upmarket HK dining experience in grand surroundings,"Caprice seems to be a place to go if you want to impress a business visitor, a potential client, a potential spouse, parents-in-law or similar. Or its a special occasion (and the company is paying!)    It’s very upmarket Hong Kong style (for a French restaurant) with grand and slightly stiff interiors and countless dishes with caviar, gold flakes and fois gras (tres HK!) My husband doesn’t eat shellfish, fois gras OR caviar and both two times we’ve been there has struggled to find something he really enjoys.  Of course the impeccable waiting staff is extremely helpful and ask for allergies and dislikes. Overall the food is delicious and beautifully constructed. You will think you are done after your small but rich courses plus various amuse bouches…but you wait, there is more (truffles and petit fours!)    Caprice isn’t necessarily my style of restaurant however I have very little to fault them with. They clearly earned their merit. My only criticism is that gold flakes, caviar and fois gras don’t make every dish better. It almost seems that they are obligatory in this level of restaurants in Hong Kong, which actually makes a less interesting and more repetitive experience. Which seems unnecessary if / when the food itself enough. Why over compensate if you have nothing to compensate for? But then, they are probably just catering for their clientele who expect that…"

Caprice (Central),30,Complacent,"Underwhelming by all means. Obviously, expectations are extremely high as it should be when one as 3 stars. Yet, at no point I felt carried away by the originality of the dishes and/or the combination of tastes and textures.  It seems the kitchen has been running a steady and complacent show as many customers might associate greatness with the size of the check rather than the actual quality of what is being put in their dishes. It is fairly common in Hong Kong where way too many restaurants have Michelin star that are not deserved, particularly if you look at it from a global perspective. I am pretty much convinced that this would not get 3 stars in France.  Mind you, the food was nice for sure, but not 3 star mesmerising and definitely not 4k per head good.  It is also getting annoying that chefs in Hong Kong put caviar and truffles on average dishes to lure the inexperienced customer into believing that it is fine dining.    If pleasure of the senses is your main concern over how posh the place is, you might want to save your money for your next trip in another city where the Michelin Guide is more reliable."

Caprice (Central),30,Unexpected experience encountered,"It started with a great and nice smile from the lady who escorted us to the table. However, we didn't receive any smiles from the staff during our meal. Also, when staff were describing the meal, they spoke too fast that we cannot listen clearly.    The service standard was quite inconsistent, sometime staff would serve meals for the whole table at the same time, and sometime they would serve meals separately. It made them not very professional.    For the meal, we ordered the Connaisseur menu. Kagoshima beef is tasty. Except for the Kagoshima beef, the rest of the meal was out of my expectation. The rest of the meals were salty and not balanced.    The experience in Caprice was not expected. 3 Michelin Stars restaurants should provide a unique and approachable service to everyone. I think everyone would enjoy the meal with an enthusiastic and cheerful service."

Caprice (Central),30,Underwhelmed,"We never really felt welcomed by the staff, except the lovely lady who escorted us to our table.    We decided to try their Connaisseur menu.    Service was sub-par and lukewarm. No standards at all when it comes to how much water should be poured into a glass, and no consistency either. My friend's hand towel had blue stains and the second one had black dots.    Staff seemed to have no idea about table service, with one server almost hitting another friend as he leaned across said friend to remove the bread plate and butter. They do not seem to care whether they serve dishes from the left or the right of the client. It is all very casual and nonchalant.    We were underwhelmed by the bread choices. The rest of the meal, with the exception of the Kagoshima beef, was mediocre and mostly too salty.    Previously, we were informed by an arrogant member of their Concierge team in the lobby, that the dress code of Caprice is ""elegant casual"" and not ""smart casual"". Well, we definitely saw a lot of ""casual"" seated at the restaurant the day of our visit - which was neither elegant nor smart.    3 Michelin Stars usually means that one can plan a trip around the venue. However, my friends and I cannot agree that Caprice possesses this level of magic."

Caprice (Central),50,Each dish was a gastronomic masterpiece,"Caprice Hong Kong's menu is thoughtfully curated, presenting a fusion of classical and contemporary French cuisine. Upon my arrival, I was cordially welcomed by the staff and escorted to my table. The dishes served were not only visually pleasing, but also delectable. I opted for the six-course tasting menu. Each dish was a gastronomic masterpiece, bursting with flavors and textures that titillated my palate. The presentation was flawless, as every dish was plated with utmost precision and care."

Caprice (Central),50,Excellent for anything,"The king carb is excellent , because they use three different ingredients to make one dish and the feeling when you eat is just like to take the sea into your eyes."

Caprice (Central),50,Amazing food with superior service,"Went to caprice for my birthday celebration with my family and I was blown away by the great food and professional service.    There were a couple of sets to choose from for their lunch menu, ranging from the most flexible 4-5 courses menu which allows you to top up for a luxury choice depends on your liking to a complete 7-9 courses seafood or cavier set which requires the entire table to order the same courses together.    We went with the 5 courses menu, and the food was truly amazing. They served their wide range of breads hot from the oven with salted & unsalted butter. Food was divine and we were so full after all the courses!    I have to mention the service was top notch. Waiters and waitresses would rush over to pull our chairs each time when someone went to the bathroom and they are so attention to details to ensure our water is always refilled, and a fresh napkin is always placed on your table if you have left your seat.    Overall it was a very pleasant experience and would definitely want to visit again!"

Caprice (Central),30,Elegant but Inconsistent Lunch,"Caprice is the famous French restaurant of the luxurious 6-star Four Seasons Hotel in Central. The grand and elegant main dining room is very spacious with a high ceiling. Servers are mostly professional and accommodating. Although beautifully presented, the 4-course (HK$ 998/person) or 5-course (HK$1,098/person) lunch menu is quite inconsistent in flavour and quality, and can easily turn into a HK$3,000/person meal if one opts for courses with additional costs. While the flavorful “Land and Sea Tartare – Australian Wagyu and Gillardeau Oyster, Kristal Caviar” (Add HK$ 550) and refreshing “Roasted Scottish Langoustine, Fresh Mango and Sea Urchin Sauce” (Add HK$650) are delectable, the lukewarm “Duck Consommé with Foie Gras Ravioli” is way too salty and the “Fish Quenelles with Shellfish and Champagne Sauce” simply tastes like ingesting mouthfuls of butter."

Caprice (Central),30,Impressive service,"I chose Caprice to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. We ordered the Menu Carte Blanche with wine pairing. The food was ok. And we are impressed by the professional service from our server, Jeffrey. He was so attentive to our table and very helpful that he wrote down all the cheese name for us.  Thanks so much for his service."

Caprice (Central),50,Amazing food served with excellence!!,"Extraordinary tasting experience perfectly shared by 3-michelin starred Caprice and Chef Guillaume Galliot.

Caprice (Central),50,First Fine Dining Experience in Hong Kong,"My girlfriend reserved a table for 2 during July with remarks of window seat as anniversary celebration. Since no response received from Caprice regarding to the remarks, we assumed they agreed to assign a window seat for us.    On the experience day, we were assigned a table far away from the window, and staff in Caprice claimed that all window seats were reserved. But then, I appreciate things which done by Ray Kwun and Jerome. Ray assigned a second row for us which is closer to the window. Ray and Jerome had excellent services which made us feel valuable, introducing every dishes, recommendations, concerning our dining experiences.    At the end of this dining experience, Ray saw us off making us feel we were your important guest.    We are planning to visit your hotel in the future as well."

Caprice (Central),50,"Excellent Cuisine, Service, Views & Environment","This is our first visit after pandemic Covid and we are very pleased to have a wonderful time at this elegant restaurant. We ordered a 4-course & a 5-course set. All dishes are very delicious and their presentation is so attractive. Strongly recommend Parmesan Tarte Riviera, Duck Consommé with Foie Gras Ravioli, as well as Beef Cheek with Mushroom and Potato Panisse. Besides, if you are willing to pay more, Land and Sea Tartare Australian Wagyu Beef and Gillardeau Oyster, Kristal Caviar is the best choice. It is worth for anyone to take a special journey there!"

Caprice (Central),50,Outstanding,"Recently visited for the 1st time, the dining experience was outstanding ! This restaurant have everything ! Exceptional Chef, stunning service and incredible Sommelier.    I enjoyed every single dishes in particular the Pigeon, sauce was perfect and well balanced and I still think about this beautiful hot and cold onion soup.    The wines were outstanding and served with lot of details and love by Victor.    I’m definitely come back for a special occasion.    Bravo Chef Guillaume and his all team !"

Caprice (Central),50,Another great meal,"I’d lunch at Caprice with a friend yesterday.    We both took the 4-course set lunch. Needless to say, the food was very good. I particularly loved the very refreshing Parmesan tart and sea bass with seafood bomba rice.    My friend loved all his dishes too. I’d some of his beef cheek. After having been slow cooked with Port and red wine, the meat was very flavourful and succulent.    What truly puts Caprice in a class of its own is its service. From my personal experience, it’s possible to find food as good as or even better than that of Caprice in some top French fine dining restaurants in Hong Kong. However, it’s difficult to find service which is as outstanding as Caprice’s.    Thanks the very professional staff (especially Victor the manager and Victor the server) for another enjoyable culinary experience."

Caprice (Central),30,Disappointing,"Used to be good and I liked it. Go back this time for birthday celebration but was quite disappointing.    Food was average and not Michelin level. The various ingredients and flavors didn’t combine to become a symphony. There was no wow at all. Even there was 2 foie Gras dishes in the course which were so similar in taste and thus boring. My husband hated the amuse bouche so much that he spit it out.    The wine pairing was the worst that we have ever had! The wine didn’t match with the food at all! Not to mention all are cheap wines that didn’t taste that well. There’s 1 wine that we really didn’t like, and when we tried to tell the sommelier, without letting us finish the sentence, he believed we wanted to praise the wine and he started to give a speech on how good he believed it was! Can you believe that would happen in a 3-star Michelin restaurant? What kind of service is that?!    We will never go there again."

Caprice (Central),50,Outstanding - Food and Service,"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary in Caprice last month.    I would like to thank you Jason for the outstanding service and the professional manner, which made the dining experience worth enjoyable.    I must need to mention that Jason is REAL Michelin star level of service! My husband and I had met him back in 2019 (our 1st year anniversary celebration). He keeps on deliver excellent service throughout the years. He remembers our food preferences; he is really attention to detail!!! (We are not a frequent guest!). Food is delicious as always. We really appreciate Jason and the whole Caprice team for the dinning arrangements."

Caprice (Central),10,Need to remind the server not to place you at the inner corner when book,"Unpleasant experience  This is our first time visiting and we leave without having the meal. We expected a fulfilling dining experience, however the restaurant placed us a seat where no view can be seen. There is no one asking if we are ok not to be seated at the window seat (that is one of the signature of the restaurant) when we reserve the table, after a one and half month wait, we are serve at the inner corner seat. When we check with the server, they advise that everyone book their table few months ago that’s why they are prioritized to take the window seat, I will wait for months if I know that’s how the restaurant arrange customer seats….  Cannot accept a Michelin three starred restaurant wants to fill up their restaurant and handle reservation that way. Don’t think it worth a second visit given the poor service from taking reservations."

Caprice (Central),50,Very pleasant experience,Couldn't be happier that my best friend chose to celebrate my birthday at Caprice with me! During my visit I had super strict dietary preferences and I was so surprised that they were able to accommodate to all my needs. Right after Gary handed me the menu he already told me all the alternatives they could offer on the set menu. The service was impeccable and the dishes were perfectly executed as always. The restaurant was so beautiful at night with the dazzling chandelier and have the most beautiful harbour view. Thank you Samuel and his team for giving me such a happy birthday. Can' wait to return!

Caprice (Central),50,Best dining experience,A romantic restaurant for special occasions. Food is of fine quality and service is outstanding. A fusion of modern and traditional French cuisines.

Caprice (Central),50,Caprice Bar,We spent the evening at Caprice Bar recently for a friends farewell drinks.    The bar team went above and beyond to make sure we had a memorable experience. The cocktails created by the bar manager were both creative and delicious.    A lovely touch from the bar manager to have “farewell” written on the dessert plate for our friend.    We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and would highly recommend.    Im already looking forward to my next visit!

Caprice (Central),50,5-star service,"Yesterday I’d lunch in Caprice again with a friend.    Every dish was very good. Instead of its usual terrine de foie gras, the menu featured pan fried foie gras which was a nice change. The Earl Grey mousse dessert which came in a sphere shape looked divine and tasted very refreshing. Even the amuse bouche (some shellfish tartare with foam) was very delicious.    Call me old fashioned . But 2 of my top favourite French restaurants in Hong Kong are Caprice and Robuchon which I’ve been going to more often than before since Covid-19.    While the food of these 2 restaurants is almost always very good, what truly sets Caprice in a class of its own is its service.    Despite the slightly formal setting, I’m always at ease dining in Caprice. Its service is certainly professional, swift, courteous and unobtrusive. But it’s the attention to details, sense of anticipation and meticulousness of the staff that make me feel special and want to return. For example, when I’d lunch there 2 or 3 months ago, mimolette wasn’t available. Yesterday when the manager Victor came to greet me, he told me they’d mimolette again. Even though I didn’t order any cheese, he offered some for us to taste."

Caprice (Central),10,Dinner at Caprice,"We have been going to Caprice at the Four Seasons HK for several years because of the food, the service, the view and the ambiance.    Unfortunately, the service has gone down the drain- the attitude of the staff - right from the hostess, the sommelier and the Restuarant assistant manager was appalling. They displayed an attitude as if they were doing us a big favor by serving the food.    I would urge the Michelin evaluators to reconsider the Michelin 3, if this pathetic service attitude continues.    Surely there are far better restaurants in Hong Kong which has good food, view and excellent service which might very well deserve a Michelin 3.    Thank you"

Caprice (Central),50,Caprice is the definition of a 3-star Michelin restaurant,"It took us around a year to finally secure a table for a weekend lunch at this acclaimed 3-star Michelin restaurant, but hands down, I must say that this gastronomical experience was worth the wait.    We were seated by the window, where we had a panoramic view of the harbour. The restaurant is decorated with luxurious European-style furniture and was very comfortable to dine in.    We opted for the 3-course lunch set (745HKD++ per person), which I believed was reasonable given the amount of value that came with the package. These are some of the highlights of the lunch:  - Apart from the appetizer, main dish (fish or meat), and the dessert, the set came with an assortment of bread with salted and unsalted butter, the Amuse Bouche (pre-appetizer), tea or coffee and the petite fours (post-dessert confectionery and sweets). The only downside is that the bottled water was relatively expensive, compared to other Michelin-starred restaurants that offer lower-cost options.  - Both the oyster and John Dory fish were flown in from Brittany, France that morning and freshly prepared for lunch. Other ingredients are high-quality and thoughtfully selected as well.  - The service and hospitality were impeccable - kudos to Janet Chu and her team! The team was very polite and professional. They even served and retrieved all the entries simultaneously for guests on the table in synchronization, which was graceful.    I would highly recommend anyone looking for a restaurant for a special occasion - if you do not know where to bring your girlfriend/boyfriend for their birthday, this is perfect. For foodies - you need to try dining here at least once!"

Caprice (Central),50,Very elegant 3 Michelin Star French Restaurant at Four Seasons Hotel,"Caprice is a long term 3 Michelin star French restaurant in Hong Kong and easily one of the best fine dining establishments in the world. The Michelin rating and price are justified by the selection, quality and presentation of the cuisine, accompanied by impeccable service & great harbour views. Highly recommended for a special occasion or to impress clients or a date."

Caprice (Central),50,"Delicious food and Meticulous service at Caprice, Fourseasons","看過不少朋友推介caprice法國菜, 除了環境優美, 米芝蓮名氣, 最重要是精緻及美味食物.  由於知道預約非常緊張, 在二,三個月前已預約, 終於可在慶祝日子, 享受一份美味午餐. 食物質素很好, 精緻又美味. 特別多謝其中一位員工, Barley. 他的態度非常親切, 用心介紹每一度菜, 更樂意幫我們拍了很多高質素相片, 留下一個開心回憶.    The food is great and delicious, It's so impressive by their team, Barley for his dedicated service. Not only can Barley meticulously introduced each dish we ordered, he was also so thoughtful to render his skillful technique to have remarkable photos for us. Looking forward to come next time"

Caprice (Central),40,Good but not as good as last time,"I went to Caprice with a friend for Saturday lunch.    We both took the menu carte blanche. Although it might seem expensive at first glance, it’s value for money. There’s so much food (amuse bouche, entrée, soup, fish, meat, cheese, dessert and mignardises) which featured various luxurious ingredients.    The food was on the whole delicious. My favourites were the blue prawn tartare amuse bouche and the sea bass with girolles and truffle. The banana and chocolate millefeuille with cacao sorbet was very tasty without being too heavy.    The beef tartare with caviar was very good. However, only after I’d finished the dish did I suddenly realise that there’s no oyster inside (contrary to what the staff had told me). The Racan pigeon would have been so much better if there hadn’t been some tendons in the meat. The selection of cheese was rather limited. My favourite époisses wasn’t available. And the blue cheese they picked for me (fourme d’ambert) was uninspiring. Raspberry jam by Christine Feber and honey of Sauternes which were served with the cheese were excellent though.    The food wasn’t as good as that of my last meal in Caprice. Still, it’s a very enjoyable lunch."

Caprice (Central),50,Wonderful lunch at Caprice,"This is one of the finest French restaurants in town. Most dishes were exceptional and some were even unforgettable, such as the lobster bisque.    I must specially recognize Jason for serving us that afternoon and paying extra attention to our dietary restriction due to food allergy."

Caprice (Central),40,"Excellent, one of the best in Hong Kong. But definitely a step down from its heyday.","My wife and I used to be somewhat of a regular at Caprice. Maybe 2-3x per year for seven or eight years. (I know. First world problems. ). However we haven’t been back for a while. On our last visit it was clear the staff experienced a lot of turnover and the atmosphere wasn’t the same (loud groups of tourists, phones, etc) made it difficult to enjoy your evening.    We recently returned. They still have their third star and we wanted to see if the last visit was an anomaly.    Note my review and expectations are for this type of restaurant. So I judge and compare against other restaurants of the same calibre.    I’ll detail below but here’s the executive summary:    The Good:    — Food is excellent with stunning presentations and taste.    — Beautiful setting that hasn’t changed in years (that’s a good thing!). They seem to have cracked down on bad behavior (no phones, kids running around, etc)    The not so good:    — Service, while excellent for Hong Kong, has dropped off some. Small items you expect at a three-star locale are now missing.    — Wine prices remain embarrassingly high. They really should be ashamed of their markup.    — While the dishes they serve are themselves fantastic, there is a distinct lack of choices and variety on the menu.    — The Caprice cheese board, formerly one of the best in the world, now has fewer choices than my local gourmet supermarket.    — Water tax of US$14 per person to drink their bottled water. It’s not the money it’s the meaning behind it.    Upon arrival we were seated at a lovely table overlooking Victoria Harbor. We were given folders for our masks and was asked if we preferred still or sparking water. A pet peeve of mine if the psuedo-obligation to order bottled water when it is not only bad for the environment but tap water is perfectly fine in a hotel that obviously filters it. However we’re were told only bottled water was available. Frustrating.    I often bring wine to restaurants we dine at, and particularly Caprice due to their exceedingly high prices for their bottles. I don’t mind 2 or even 3 times markup but 4-5 times is criminal. A nice burgundy that retails for US$200 becomes nearly $1000 there. Caprice charges US$100 for corkage and while that is also the highest in the city I will gladly pay that over paying $300 for a $40 bottle.    I also like to bring unique wines. (In this case an aged burgundy that likely would have cost me close to $1500-2000 if they had it.) They asked if I wanted it opened and I said yes. The sommelier came over, took the bottle, opened it away from us and returned and poured. Didn’t ask if I wanted it poured yet just fired away.    Another small slight is the former sommelier or their staff always would comment on my wine, offer some thoughts on it or suggest similar wines. We'd inevitably have a nice discussion on wine and as I’m always looking for new bottles to try I’d always come away with some notes. I’d usually offer them a glass (yes even for $900 bottles I brought) if he were interested in trying it.    This time however, not a word. Pop and pour is what we got for US$100.    The wait staff, a nice young woman, offered us menus and asked if she could explain it. Of course we said. She then explained the menu as one would to a first time diner in a restaurant. “The “S” means it’s a signature dish”. I really would prefer more of an explanation of the dishes. She was fine, and it’s not her fault, she’s clearly been given a script, but this is something we didn’t experience on previous visits.    We noticed there were very few choices, particularly among the mains and several of those were for two people so that further limited our options.    I’ll also mention that maybe a third of the dishes feature caviar. I assume this is one way to justify the price to local diners who don’t fully appreciate the cost involved in preparing this type of cuisine.    We elected to go with the seven-course tasting menu.    We were shortly thereafter offered some canapés and a selection of bread and both salted and unsalted butter. Nice to see some things haven’t changed.    Shortly thereafter they brought what was called an “amuse bouche” but was shown as the first course on the menu. hmmm. It was however a beautiful beef tartare dish with caviar. The tartare was nice but the caviar was unneeded honestly. The delicate flavor of the caviar is overpowered by the cornichons in the tartare. 7/10    Next was what was described as the first “real” course. A perfectly poached langoustine with (again) caviar along with a white asparagus with a cream topping. This was a knock-out dish (but not the best of the night) and the flavors really worked and the presentation was stunning. 9/10    Next came what was for me, the (surprisingly) highlight of the night: a green pea soup. But mind you, this was not any green pea soup but one that must have been made with loving care for hours before it found its way onto my plate. Makes with fresh green peas, it had a velvety texture that was simply amazing. Topped with an almond cream emulsion and containing small raviolis. I wasn’t sure what they contained. It was firm and savory. I later learned it was a type of aged goat cheese. Wow. this entire dish worked together like a symphony. 11/10    Next came the fish course, which was a grilled (maybe roasted) turbot that has been poached or rubbed with saffron to give it an orangish appearance and topped with sliced mushrooms. Combined with a bisque sauce. I found it very enjoyable, although my wife found it lacking taste. 6/10    Next came the meat course. Here, the tasting menu offered two options: either a racan roasted pigeon or an Australian wagyu beef (at a US$55 surcharge). I chose the pigeon, while my wife chose the beef. She likes her beef medium well, and asked for this, but the wait staff suggested medium would be better as medium well would end up being too tough. She agreed (which would later be regretted).    My pigeon was excellent. Having been roasted inside a cocoa pod, it was embedded with small nibs of cocoa also. Mine was medium rare, and had the gamey taste that roasted pigeon features. Paired with a slice of foie gras on a strawberry compote (not sweet however) and a demiglace, along with some small potatoes, it was a very nice dish. 8/10    The beef was presented grilled, with two stalks of green asparagus topped with a bone marrow gelee. Despite ordering it medium (and the staff knowing she wanted it closed to medium well), it was very much medium rare. The beef is a marbled wagyu on par with wagyu from Japan. Actually, beef like this should be cooked a bit father, to help render the fat inside. I suggested she send it back, but she did not want to wait to eat. I won't rate it since I didn't try it but she wasn't very happy.    Next came the cheese course. This has always been one of our favorite highlights of a meal at Caprice. Cheeses from Bernard Antony, and a massive selection at that, what's not to love. Well, when they rolled it up, we both found it a bit disappointing. Instead of 30+ choices, there were maybe half that. Thankfully, their 48 month comte was still there. But missing was mimolette (they used to have a wonderful 36 month variety), epoisses, several blue varieties (they had one only), and just a general lack of variety.    My wife is a huge fan of epoisses, and was disappointed they didn't have any. The staff presenting the cheese, did say he would check in the cellar if there was any available. Meanwhile we each chose from the available selection. I went with a selection of goats cheeses, including one (I didn't get the name) that was amazing, with concentrated flavor and strong pine needles notes, along with the requisite comte which really shouldn't be missed. 8/10    A short time later, the staff returned with a piece of epoisses for my wife. Very nice of him to help with that.    One small criticism, in the past, the sommelier usually would appear and offer some wine to go along with our cheese selection (he even suggested beer in the past to pair with certain varieties). However, again, the sommelier was no where to be seen. We would have been interested in perhaps a dessert wine, or a banuyls (?) wine to go with some of these. But alas, wasn't offered the opportunity.    After that we were presented with dessert which was a small shortcake, with mango and kiwi (?). Nice but nothing special, not even that pretty. 4/10    We were given some petit fours and chocolates. Again, a Caprice tradition, with the small box with the drawer of chocolates, but something felt lacking here also.    Overall the meal was very nice. But, for the price, I expect perfection and this wasn't that. (The tasting menu is HK$2280 or US$300 and the total was HK$6500 or US$830: two tasting menus, one beef surcharge, water and one corkage)    We never saw the manager (who in the past would always stop by to see how things were) nor the sommelier after the aforementioned pop and pour (he never even came to ask us if we wanted another bottle after finishing the one we brought). Our wait staff was very attentive and kind - no complaints about her, in fact, we found her to be the most attentive of everyone we encountered.    There is certainly nothing wrong with the quality of local staff and they're very professional in how they approach their work, but I found in the past that having some French staff to help train and guide the service quality to that found at Le Cinq or Guy Savoy in Paris helps increase the polish of the staff and the overall experience comparable to that found in Paris. Don't think this sort of training is happening anymore.    The setting is still wonderful and the atmosphere what you would expect at this calibre of restaurant.    I want to give this a 3/5 rating but the quality of the food itself, thanks to Chef Guillaume Galliot saved the experience, so Caprice gets 4/5 from me."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Deserves the 3 Michelin star,"3 michelin star 10 seater counter sushi place that needs a reservation. Some of my favorites here include Uni from Miyagi prefecture with corn pudding, fresh Takobutsu, and the Hairy Crab on Wintermelon puree."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Excellent food. Excellent Chef. Excellent service.,Food was outstanding with excellent preparation. Highly recommended. Our private tour guide recommended this longstanding restaurant in the heart of Tokyo.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,nice,after visiting sushi shikon in hong kong we were happy to be able to dine at sushi yoshitake. the high expectations were fulfilled and the evening was funny in the end as some guests and the chef were smart entertainers. beautiful new location.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The best sushi place on this planet,"Continuing to win six Michelin stars, the master sushi chef Mr Yoshitake is a legendary! So many appetizers makes one so happy. Better to book thru hotel concierge. Definitely the best is Ginza, Tokyo, Japan and this planet!! ミシュラン6つ星シェフの吉武さんの寿司は芸術の域を越えてます。握り前に頂く品々でノックダウン。最高の職人技に誰もが満足することでしょう。"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best Sushi I've ever had in my life,"After a friend got us a reservation which you have to do long in advance, we were in for a treat.  The whole experience was nothing short of amazing and all the details were thought of. Service was great on all fronts and Yoshitake is a true culinary wizard. Not cheap but worth the expense"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Do not miss this place,"If you want a super special sushi, don’t miss Yoshitake. The menu is exquisite, the service is fantastic and the food does not require a review. I would go back a thousand times!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,"Wow, just spectacular","This restaurant is in a very nondescript building in one of the backstreets off the main Ginza strip. It wasn't hard to find but do your research before hand. This is a 7 seater restaurant so take note there is a cancellation policy. It wasn't easy getting a reservation for this place as they only open up reservations at the certain time and it gets booked out quickly. I was lucky and got my reservation via my hotel concierge 2 months before my trip.  Master Yoshitake-san was very friendly. I was the only non-Japanese speaker in that sitting and he took time to explain everything he was serving to me in English.  The meal started of with some cooked appetizers and sashimi. I have to say they were incredible. From the monkfish liver to the bonito in a bonito broth to octopus. The stand out for me was the abalone in an abalone liver sauce. It was bursting with flavour and the sauce was deliciously decadent and creamy.  There were quite a lot of courses (8) served before the sushi course began. And then a total of 14 pieces of sushi were served. It was an extremely filling dinner, and I was very full at the end which is unusual for me.  As for the sushi, Master Yoshitake uses a red vinegar in his shari apparently, which gives it a brownish tint. His shari was mild and perfectly complimented the fish. Every single piece I had was spectacular, but my favourites were the lightly smoked yellowtail, of course the chutoro and otoro, the 2 types of uni, the kuruma-ebi and the anago.  The meal was just fantastic. i think this will be my go to splurge restaurant in Tokyo now (if I can get a reservation that is!). Just outstanding."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,We had an amazing time - delicious sushi and great ambiance!,"Nestled amongst the buildings at the back of Ginza, we finally pin-pointed the correct building and made our way up in the lift. We opened the sliding door and was met by the maitre-d in western bow tie, black vest and pants. He verified our names and asked us to wait a bit as we were early.    Within a couple of minutes, we were ushered in. The head chef greeted us and his team looked up from their work and also greeted us warmly. We felt most welcomed. This small, Michelin star restaurant has 7 counter seats only. Booking is essential. We did this via our hotel about a month in advance. Bookings need to be made for the next month, preferably at the beginning of the month before. Our hotel did the booking for us at the beginning of August to dine in September. So far, we noted that Peninsula Tokyo and Palace Hotel have been able to secure bookings at these hard to get restaurants.    I ordered sake and it was recommended that we move from the first carafe at the top of the sake menu to the next, as the meal progresses. We enjoyed the sake very much and ended up consuming 3 carafes [180ml each]    The meal is ""omakase"" [translated to ""as the chef pleases'] with lots of preparation that goes into the meal. A small paper menu in English is laid up on the table for us to follow the meal course. The left side was mostly sashimi-style with some type of accompaniment. Example - the freshly grilled eel was accompanied by edamame soup with dollop of caviar.    This lot of courses showcased the depth of talent at Yoshitake. Much of the flavours of the fish were well paired with other preparations made by the chefs. The chefs worked very well together and you can tell that they enjoyed their tasks.    The head chef was ably assisted by a younger assistant and he helped grate the wasabi, chop the fish, prepare the fish for smoking, and heated up the seaweed for the final Temaki handroll, amongst other things. There's a chef team in the kitchen, prepping or cooking the food. They all integrated well as a team and it was really nice to see such a well-oiled machine.    The sushi course started after the team sliced the respective fish variety, bathed it in soya sauce or further preparations. Once half the sushi course were lined up in a Parade Square manner, the chef-owner dipped his hands in cold water and started to prepare the sushi and deliver it to his patrons. He was always careful to deliver the tasty morsels from left to right, then from right to left; with each patron or family given a chance to receive their sushi first.    The head-chef was talkative and interacted well with two Japanese ladies. He also talked to the other couple and us three. He also gently chided my son for slouching half on the table and half against the corner, telling him he had to sit up straight for receive his sashimi. When my wife and I started an animated conversation about the peeling process of the prawns, he laughed and asked us what was happening.    We had a vey pleasant dining experience. Our dinner booking was for 8.30pm, and we did not end till 10.15pm. We hung around a little more before saying our thanks in Japanese and moving off. The meal here was more reasonable than our previous Michelin star Sushi meal - with more courses and more sake.    This is a certainly a great sushi practitioner and well worth the Michelin star. Ee certainly enjoyed ourselves with such amazing food and such warm company. We will return another day!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The Very Authentic and Interesting Experience,"This is a very small restaurant but the attention to detail and the way the whole experience is delivered was a one off experience. While you will get a very personal experience in other places, SY takes it to a whole different level. Every mouthful is skillfully constructed.    It mist be noted that if you're out for a relaxed night out that this is not the place. This is about an intense food focused experience."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The best Sushi experience ever..,"I been here invite by a japanese colleague,otherwise apparently is not easy to dine here,  The restaurant is open only in dinner time, and is always full, you have 2hours for enjoy your dinner, they not give you a menu a la carte but is fix from the chef, that is preparing in front of you and is just amazing and also what I loved is the commune table we was sitting 7 peoples on the counter and most of us not know each others.. in the end of the dinner you have new friends.."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Worth every penny,"Had Visa Concierge help make the reservation and is still one of the few restaurants that allow for a 3rd party to make reservations for you. Some hotels wont even help make the reservation while some of the sushi restaurants only will take hotel concierge reservations. A month before heading out to Japan, our chances to get into a nice sushi restaurant seemed very slim but Visa Concierge came through for 4 people at 8:30pm in the private room. The food was local. The flavors were amazing. The Chef himself, was cheerful and spoke English very well. He made us laugh and feel comfortable. We had 3 carafes of sake and it came out to a total of 325 per person. Would I do it again? yes. Was it worth it? yes."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,What a Treat!,"We really enjoyed our evening at Sushi Yoshitake. There are only seven counter seats and Chef Yoshitake presides. There are almost as many staff who keep drinks filled and help prepare the tasting menu. The dinner takes about two hours for you to eat and enjoy each morsel. The staff were very friendly and spoke English. We felt very welcomed, almost as if we were in Chef's home. This is a very expensive night out but if you can go for it we recommend it. We have been to many Michelin starred restaurants throughout the world and this was yet another unique and very special evening to be remembered."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The gem of Tokyo. One of the best I ever have.,"Late review of Sushi Yoshitake. Chef Yoshitake is one of the top Sushi chefs that stands at the pinnacle of the art together with Jiro and Saito. The restaurant is located at a inconspicuous building which took me awhile to find. In short, a middle age lady suddenly approached and asked me whether I am looking for Sushi Yoshitake. At the restaurant, Chef Yoshitake was very friendly and warm throughout and the service of other staff was impeccable. Every slice of sushi and sashimi was made with the freshest fish. So fresh and sweet that it made all other sushi and sashimi I ever had, except Shinji and Shoukouwa, an insult to what sushi and sashimi should be. All the sashimi simply melted in my mouth. The assortment sushi and sashimi carried various taste to the max: fresh, mild, rich, buttery, firm, subtle, sweet, and brine. Few dishes stood up among the rest of the treasure. Steamed abalone with abalone liver sauce. The creamy, deep and a combination of egg plus foie gras taste. The option to have the remaining of the sauce with top grade Japanese rice was simply marvelous. The sea urchin, fatty tuna and unagi sushi caught my attention as well. The rich, buttery, and briny taste of the sea urchin was so delicious that it reminisces the ocean. I lost words with the fatty tuna and unagi sushi. The fatty tuna and unagi evaporated once they reached your mouth. Minimum chewing effort was required as they slide down my throat. Fat, creamy, and rich coupled with the perfect sushi skills. Now I can no longer go back to ordinary sushi. Next time in Japan, I will definitely try Jiro and Saito. For now, only Shinji and Shoukouwa can satisfy my palate. Not forgetting to mention, Chef Yoshitake was warm and professional enough to greet each and every customer when they leave and I managed to take pictures with him."

Sushi Yoshitake,30,Not Enjoyable Dining Experience,"We chose Sushi Yoshitake mainly based on reviews saying that it was friendlier to foreigners compared to other high end sushi restaurants. In our personal experience, this was not the case. There were 6 of us at the counter: 3 foreigners and 3 Japanese speakers. From the start, it was plainly obvious that the chef was selecting certain cuts for the Japanese speakers. Of course, he is free to do as he pleases, but it didn't make us feel exactly welcomed. As the dinner progressed, I could sense the chefs passing judgment on the other foreigner diner, who was neither loud nor ridiculous.    All in all, the food was good. However not good enough to compensate for the unpleasant dining experience. If you're someone like me who enjoys sushi, but not enough to pay money to be uncomfortable, I'd go to Kyubei instead."

Sushi Yoshitake,20,Service & Techniques over Taste,"This restaurant highlights my opinion that the Michelin Guide is more about experience than Taste.    As mentioned earlier, this restaurant is located in the difficult to find  すずりゅ:suzuryu building. The outside of the building is dirty & scummy, though inside was immaculate.    Opinions of this place often state that the Otsumami here are better than the Nigiri - personally I preferred the Nigiri over the Otsumami while my Japanese dining companion didn't enjoy the red akazu vinegar used in the sushi rice.    Overall I thought that the menu was about subtlety and restraint created through innovative textures & techniques rather than TASTE!    Noteworthy Dishes:    Braised Octopus: had a brilliant colour & been well massaged, making it very easy to eat.    The famous Abalone in Liver sauce For Me was a letdown - whilst the Abalone had a noticeable smokey flavour, I found it to be too chewy and not tender enough, and overshadowed by the awesomeness of the Liver sauce.    Frozen squid - this had one of the most interesting textures of any dish I've eaten.    Double Hokkaido Uni Gunkan - Easily the Best dish of the Entire Meal - the Only thing on the menu that gave me that Angels accompanied by Heavenly Trumpets feeling.    Overall I'd consider the food here to be Very Good, but I was expecting more Taste Wise from a 3 star restaurant charging $250 a head. Both me and my dining companion agreed we much preferred the Kaiseki at Kyubey"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Amazing Sushi Dinner Experience,"I wanted one excellent Sushi dinner and really wanted Jiro because of the hype but only tried 2 weeks before and couldn't get it. This was my second choice and I was flexible and only one so I got in. Generally recommend you book a few weeks before. As it turns out, I am thrilled it worked out this way.  Food was five star plus. A mix of raw and slightly cooked prepared and presented in a thoughtful exciting manner. Chef (owner) was extremely friendly and spoke a couple of words in English but that was enough to make it a great time. For approx $300 US you will eat sushi like a king in a pleasant space and enjoy the experience which will last approx 2 1/2 hours, far longer than the short experience at Jiro. Every single piece of food was delicious and memorable.  Would and will go back at a moment's notice (If I could get a seat!)"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Really wonderful experience,"Really terrific meal. It is a splurge, for sure, but it's one of those meals you should splurge for. You will seat at a counter for around 7 people, all start at once (you MUST be there promptly!), and two chefs will work inches from your face preparing all manner of ocean goodness. It is fascinating to watch them work, and delicious to taste the results. There are so many individual items served to you, one at a time, that you will not walk away hungry (though I had initially feared that I would). The sushi is prepared with rice served so warm and tender that the advice - in this elegant place! - is to eat it with your fingers just a few seconds after it is placed in front of you. I am drooling thinking about it as I write the review."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Suburashi des ! Nihon Ichi 7 ... no 8 stars !,"Ladies and Gents I have eaten many meals in many places.  I lie not when I say that was the most amazing meal I have ever had.  The depth of flavour, the artistry.. sheer delight.  Yes it ain't cheap but boy if you have to choose something for the bucket list .. choose this.  Just awesome the monkfish live was my favourite."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Amazing meal!!!!!!!,This is one of the Michelin dining experience and definitely the best sushi we ever had. We had a private room and an amazing chef who prepared super delicious food for us. The total came out to be about $550 usd for two people which is pricy but worth the experience!!

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Go!,"6 diners at the counter in very close proximity to the chef and his assistants. Almost fanatical attention to detail. My husband was instructed to eat his sushi immediately and not wait for me. You will fall in love with sea urchin. There were 2 different ones served in a maki roll. The nori was grilled over charcoal in front of us. The contrast between the warm rice, crisp nori and cold sweet uni was sublime. 3rd floor of a nondescript brick building on a back street, give yourself plenty of time as they start service on the dot!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,One of the best meals we've ever eaten,My wife and I had a truly exceptional meal here. Chef Yoshitake is considered to be one of the three greatest sushi chefs alive and his artistry and talent were very evident the night we ate there. If you can get a reservation grab it.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Amazing,What a special meal! It is so cool to be able to sit in such a small space and be served by one of the world's best sushi chefs. We had 18 courses and each was unique and absolutely mind blowing. Loved the steamed abalone and the fatty tuna. All were amazing.    Not an inexpensive meal to be sure but if you are looking for something special look no further.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,BEST sushi restaurant we have ever been to...,"My husband and I travel alot. When we travel to Tokyo, which is one of our more frequent destinations, we always book the Michelin Starred restaurants to try. They might not always be THE best, but the list is pretty ""safe"" to say it's good and high quality restaurants.    We have been to many sushi restaurants around the world, and all around Japan. We are NOT easy to be impressed. Sushi Yoshitake is now the TOP on my list of sushi restaurants, and probably one of the very top restaurants we have ever been to. Ledbury in London, and Sushi Yoshitake in Tokyo. Never forget again.    The quality of sushi here is impeccable. We had the luxury and luck of getting a private room and the chef Dai was the most professional and best sushi chef we have ever had. The atmosphere, the quality of sushi, the menu planning, the professional service, the pace, the price.... absolutely flawless.    It's really hard to book a reservation. Book through your hotel concierge is your best chance, and must be quite well in advance.    The entrance of the building doesn't even indicate any signage outside. It's hard to find actually. The building looks very drabby. The entrance of the restaurant is unnoticeable. When we arrived at 810pm, (reservation at 830pm), we didn't see any entrance to any restaurant. It looked like a really drabby old building that looks deserted. Then we looked carefully, and walked to wards a grey colour very old door. There was a paper that said, THIS DOOR OPENS only at 620pm and 820pm.    That was shocking to us actually. We thought there would be a waiting area for us even if we arrived early. There isn't. So arrive on time. The policy is very strict. If you no show, you will be charged for the full price. If you are late, they have the right to cancel your reservation, and you will be charged as well.    So don't be late if you have a reservation at Sushi Yoshitake.    I cannot wait to go again next time we go to Tokyo."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,I went to Hesven and came back!!!,"Best Sushi in my life. If you come to Tokyo you cannot Miss this Restaurant. Amazon good, great chef! Don't change anything from the menú, it's just perfect!!!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Please do not leave Tokyo without trying this restaurant!,"This is my favorite sushi place in Tokyo (I've been to Jiro's). It's a welcoming place where Chef Yoshitake and his staff are quite nice. Why do I like it so much? For me, this restaurant has the best sushi rice I've ever had. In terms of the omakase, their selection of the fish is also been excellent. It's one of those meals you wish wouldn't end because it's so good. It can be difficult to get a seat but worth trying as it would be a miss to leave Tokyo without going here."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Sushi at the Highest Level,"We wanted to experience sushi at the highest level and chose Yoshitake for its 3 star Michelin rating. We had our concierge at the Park Hyatt make the reservation for us a month in advance, as Yoshitake doesn't take reservations more than one month out. The sushi bar (main dining room) only has 7 seats at the bar and only two separate seating times so one can imagine the challenge of obtaining one. There is also a small private dining room, but I highly recommend sitting at the bar to have the full dining experience of watching and interacting with chef Yoshitake as he prepares your food. Yoshitake-San spoke English very well and explained each dish as he presents it to us. He was very cordial and answered any questions that we had. Not once did we feel intimidated to ask him any questions. My wife was hesitant of the few items ( uni, octopus, and squid) due to past experiences, but she was amazed how wonderful they were prepared by chef Yoshitake and how excellent they taste. This was truly an amazing experience for us - from the attentive service to the excellent execution of the food to the exceptional quality and taste. It was a dining experience that we will remember for a long time. Sushi Yoshitake will be the measuring stick by which we will measure future sushi restaurants."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Awesome Sushi,"This is the best Sushi I've ever had. Very difficult to book and we are lucky to book the last two seats during our stay. Chef has fantastic technique and offer Omakase. There is only 7 seats available for each slot. There is no lunch served and two slots for dinner, 6PM to 8PM and 8:30PM to 10:30PM. Sunday is off."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Exquisite,"In a small building in Ginza, this is a tiny 7 seater. Amazing. Omakase course that started with a few dishes like grilled fish, sashimi , boiled abalone (their specialty). Then the parade of about 12 exquisite pieces of sushi began. Each more delicious than the previous. Incredible meal"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best sushi ever,"The plaudits are well deserved. I even managed to get past the uni, which is usually too much of a barrier for me. Best sushi I've ever had."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Sublime,"Came here last month for a business dinner and was so impressed that I decided to spend my birthday dinner here again when I returned to Tokyo with my wife and another couple. All four of us have eaten pretty good sushi elsewhere in Tokyo and Hong Kong, but we all agreed that Yoshitake is at another level of its own. I haven't had the good fortune of eating in the main dining room (with a whooping size of 7 diners), but have always been served by Dai in the smaller private room. I'm sure we are not the only ones to get lost finding the restaurant in a most unimpressive building on a side street in Ginza. Nor would we be the only ones to stare in disbelief when shown the little hole in the wall that we had to crawl through to get to the private room for four. But I like the cozy atmosphere and I like Dai a lot. A LOT! He's attentive, friendly, funny, ultra serious about his art, obsessed with the jewels in front of him, caressing/slicing/dicing them in various ways just to make them explode with freshness and flavours in your mouth. Several times his delicate creations brought tears in my eyes... literally. It's an other worldly experience to dine there and I surely recommend it to everyone who can afford. You won't regret it."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,An unbelievable experience,"This was by far the most amazing meal of my life for many reasons    We were sitting in the main room which seats 7, right at the counter. Yoshitake came and welcomed us and chatted for a while. He also explained all the dishes in english - all the other guests were Japanese - and even poured and refilled our drinks which was a bit surreal!    The food was incredible and surprising and so fresh. The tuna was nearly glowing it was so fresh. The meal started with some cooked and combination dishes which were all extremely delicate and then the second half was all sushi. Dishes I was a bit nervous of (squid, octopus and eel) were all beautiful and the sea urchin was probably one of the nicest things I've ever eaten    This was an incredible experience and I will never forget it"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Unbelievable experience in the private room!,"I dined with two friends in the private room and had an unbelievable sushi experience. To put things into perspective, we enjoyed Sawada, Hashiguchi and Harutaka within a week prior to this and we all agreed this was the best experience. I usually don't make reviews but I feel a duty to share my recommendation with TripAdvisor users as this was truly an unforgettable experience. If you are considering between multiple sushi restaurants then beware that 'best' is very subjective and much of the differences people report on are based on a difference in style (rather than being 'better/worse' or the 'best'). Different sushi masters have different styles of art, different rice composition, temperature, wasabi or vinegar strengths etc. These are all intentional and will come down to preference.    I noticed a few of the lower rated reviews mentioned being seated in the private room as a huge downside, enough to warrant 1* in some cases.. Any respectable concierge will tell you in ADVANCE if you are going to be seated in the private room. We knew going into the experience this was the case, and there are certainly some advantages. The privacy of being only amongst your own company can give a more intimate and comfortable experience, and the chef (Dai) was clearly an expert master. If you are going for a single place, of course I would suggest trying to get seated in the main room or with a chef in general as the experience is as important as the actual food.    I would also highly recommend ignoring any reviews that directly compare the restaurant to ""Jiro"" - as this almost always means a tourist who doesn't know anything about sushi. Giving a review of 1* just because the (unknowledgeable) diner thought (based on their non-experienced) it wasn't as good as the over-hyped Jiro is ridiculous..  So, I will not say this is the 'best' sushi in the world or similar. I will simply say I think the reviews speak for themselves and we had the best overall experience here overall.    Everything was great but highlights include the double-uni, house-specialty abalone and liver sauce, all tuna (toro, chu-toro and otoro).."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Fantastic food and reception,"Great host. Great staff. Definitely the best sushi experience I've ever had. But comes at a price. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Tokyo who can afford to splash out. A couple of other places in Tokyo may offer the same quality of sushi, but the graciousness and warmth of Yoshitake San and the rest of the team has been incomparable."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best sushi,Best sushi ever! Definitely worth the visit. We enjoyed it more than jiro - more relaxed atmosphere and enjoyable experience.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Fine Cantonese Dining,"This is Cantonese cuisine at its finest. The restaurant offers an extensive menu which includes many of the classics as well as their own signature dishes. The wine list is reasonably extensive with a selection of international wines. Service is efficient and friendly, and the ambience is unobtrusive. For the best Peking Duck in Hong Kong, make sure to order it in advance when making the table reservation."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Superb Quality,The Tang Court was conveniently located at the Langham Hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui district. The staff was very helpful with our inquiries when we made the reservations. The dining choices were plentiful and we really loved the Tasting menu. The restaurant staff were very polite with great customer service in mind. The food was truly made to perfection with great passion and thoughts. The food was well prepared with great presentation and superb quality.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Refreshing take on Cantonese cuisines,"The main dishes we had are very light on seasoning. The flavours all came from the fresh high quality ingredients, a refreshing take on Cantonese cuisine. We enjoyed it very much.  The only minus point was the air conditioning was really cold, better bring a jacket even when it's 28 Celsius outside."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Lunch at Tang Court,"I have came here often to visit the restaurant, and I heard there’s a new Chinese Restaurant named Tang Court. So I asked my friends to come having lunch together, it was beautiful interior as it’s located at level 61. I was greeted by Service Stylist Haniffa at Lobby. She is very helpful taking my photos and friendly. Thank you for the service"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,A Memorable Culinary Experience!,"Fabulous - and a memory to treasure for years to come. We booked a table at the T'ang Court as part of our Hong Kong trip and for a 3 star Michelin experience, and we were delighted with our Tasting Menu choice.  Fantastic!! `We were also very well looked after by both Joey and Jessica. Highly recommend!!!"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",40,《3 Michelin stars | Must-try crab shell》,"Awarded three Michelin stars for consecutive years, < T'ang Court > at The Langham Hotel serves some of the most sophisticated Cantonese dishes in Hong Kong. And it is one of the few Cantonese restaurants around the world to receive this award!  Their signature [ Baked stuffed crab shell ] is a not-to-be-missed! Generous amount of crab meat, onion and cream sauce - so flavorful! If you are a fan of Cantonese barbecue pork, be sure to try their [ Char siu ] too! [ Fried rice with Wagyu ] was also very impressive. Besides, staff is attentive and knowledgeable about their menu.  Got some complimentary birthday buns too as the restaurant knew we were having a birthday celebration there. How sweet!    〔 Follow me on instagram @sikbaobaola ! ^^ 〕"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,My all-time favourite Chinese restaurant,"I used to come to this restaurant quite frequently many years ago, but since it got the Michelin 3-star status, my last visit was already about three years. Returning today I want to see whether they continue to keep up to the great experience I used to get.    Even though the décor has not changed for many years, the restaurant still exhibits a nice ambience and not dated. Seated comfortably, the tables are spacious and sparsely separated, allowing good privacy.    Decided to order a la carte, we are served a complimentary amuse bouche. The Salt and Pepper Abalone is very appetizing, with the right balance of salty and spiciness. The abalone is cooked just perfect, can easily bite through without cutting into smaller pieces.    Originally picking a bottle of Australia Semillon, unfortunately it is no longer available. The staff brings me a couple of other Australia whites and I end up choosing Brygon Reserve ‘The Bruce’ Chardonnay 2009 ($1,050) from Margaret River. A versatile wine to pair with dishes.    The signature Baked Stuffed Crab Shell ($250 each) is beautifully deep-fried, with a golden-brown crust. Inside are stuffed with abundance of crab meat, which has been mixed with onion and cream sauce. The delicate flavours of the crab meat are very delicious. Best in town in my opinion.    I have Braised Mixed Seafood with Bean Curd in Hot and Sour Soup ($240). The soup is very tasty, having the right intensity of sour and spicy flavours, with the addition of some aged Zhejiang vinegar to increase the complexity even further. The lobster and scallops, and the crab meat on some silky soft bean curd, has the sweetness of fresh seafood to complement the flavours of the soup.    My wife has picked Braised Conpoy with Shredded Fish Maw Soup ($190) and she likes that very much as well.    Then it is Baked Stuffed Sliced Grouper with Shrimp Paste and Port Wine ($400). The original portion has eight pieces, but the staff helpfully recommends us to order half portion to save our stomach for other dishes. The texture is wonderful, with the bouncy minced shrimp paste stuffed to the grouper fillet, absorbing the sweetness and savoury from the port wine in the baking process.    The specialty for winter is Stewed Lamb in Casserole ($980). Heated on stove on the side before serving, it is bubbling hot, with plenty of tender lamb, black mushrooms, bean curd skin, water chestnut and bamboo shoots. Great in taste and not salty, even without dipping in the fermented bean curd sauce it is flavourful enough. Adding lettuce to the casserole after half finishing, the vegetable soaks up the sauce which makes it equally delicious. It might seem expensive, but I strongly recommend it to lamb-eaters.    For dessert we have Sesame Rolls ($60) to share. A traditional dim sum, these sesame rolls are not too sweet, with some toasted white sesame sprinkled on top to give a better appearance and texture. Very good but we think the portion size might be a bit too small.    The restaurant also has other complimentary dim sums, including Osmanthus Jelly, made from the honey-scented osmanthus, wolfberries and rock sugar, in a heart-shaped jelly. The other looks like a mini pear but is in fact a pineapple pastry. Both are very delicious.    Wrapping up I have Baked Sago Pudding filled with Lotus Seed Paste ($70). Another traditional dessert, the surface of the pudding has been caramelized with wonderful fragrance, and the sago is good in texture. The lotus seed paste is not too sweet as well. My wife has picked Sweetened Red Bean Soup with Tangerine Peels ($70) and is also very nice.    Service is impeccable, with the staff friendly and attentive. After 15% discount, the bill on the night is $3,458 and is reasonable considering the quality of the food, the ambience, and the service. Really enjoy the dinner and T’ang Court remains my all-time favourite Chinese restaurant in town."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Tasting menu is superb,"One of the rare Michelin 3 star restaurants in Hong Kong, this was a place I opted to dine while taking advantage of the ""take all the credit"" promotion offered by the hotel. The tasting menu was a great highlight of what this restaurant had to offer, but the staff will easily tell you there are a lot more dishes that are worth to sample. Staff were also very attentive and would give a short intro of the dish presented and offer hints on how to savour it (sauces etc).    Servings were very large and hefty. Definitely you will feel full. To describe a few dishes the crab was absolutely tasty and the freshness and delicate flavours were enough without the dipping sauce. The baked lobster was just the right size, done so it was just off the shell and tender. The beef was very rich and full, but slightly on the salty side but nonetheless you can taste that it is wagyu. Rarely a tasting menu can be so filling that bu the time it was time for dessert you were full!"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Excellent Food,"We went there a few times, both dinner and lunch and the food was more than excellent. Pricewise is not too bad considering the quality. Seating environment is so so... as there is absolutely no view at all. Service is ""OK"" and it can be better considering it is a prestige restaurant. Also, every time I made the reservation and asked if they can arrange a better area, they said it is very full. However, when I dine there, it's half empty. Very strange."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",30,Not for special occasions,"We had a tasting menu. The food and the service are good. But not the exceptional as the Michelin 3 stars restaurant.  Its fine if come to have a causal dinner, not for the special occasions. As the restaurant loud noise of babies and children make conversations more difficult.  Overall, Tang court’s food & service are fine for a causal meal."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Not just 3*** hype,"Excellent Chinese fare, this place is worth the three stars and not just hype.    Although the decor is a little strange / dare I say tacky in some parts … a bit Arabian dessert tent meets European palace look with some modern chinese art and sculptures. And the aircon was a bit too cold which is pretty unusual for a fine dining joint, but probably due to the age of the building.    But onto the real reason for coming, and that’s the food! It is indeed excellent. We went for a set, but I’m sure the items are available a la Carte and I would highly recommend:    - the chilled South African abalone (!!!!)  - the stuffed crab shell which is meant to be a signature dish. Suggest sharing this as it’s quite rich / filling of you are keen to try other stuff  - the wagyu and  -the baked sago lotus seed dessert.    Tip: don’t bother with the wine by the glass, was pretty ordinary and unexpected for a starred restaurant"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Wow! What an amazing restaurant,"The experience was truly amazing and the food was delicious. Angeka Kee serviced us, and she was very attentive. Of course its not a cheap meal, but we would definitely go back."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",30,Birthday dinner,"T’ang Court is the 3 Michelin star Chinese restaurant at the Langham Hotel in TST.    The Langham isn’t the most obvious place to host a 3 star restaurant. First impressions: the faux opulence presented by the Langham doesn’t work as it looks decidedly fake. It also results in a dark oppressive decor that isn’t in the least bit attractive. Walking into the restaurant doesn’t help since the carpet is faded and worn and patches on the wall close to our table showing signs of potential mould give the wrong impression as well.    Setting this aside - we were there for the food after all - this was a birthday dinner where we selected one of the two set dinner menus on offer - we opted for the 6 course menu. Since we weren’t fans of abalone we asked for a replacement for that course.    An Amuse Bouche came in the form of a scallop salad. Light and refreshing but with no particular flavours.    Our starter course demonstrated flashes of brilliance - an extended dish with four bite sized portions working right to left and cold to warm - jellyfish, scallops with honeyed pomelo, char siu and a piece of deep fried cod. The jellyfish - an under-utilised ingredient - was flavoursome which was then balanced with the following scallops with citrus honey. The char Siu is - to my mind - some of the best I have had in HK for a long time. The texture was superb without being too fatty and meat suffused with flavour. The cod was gorgeous although quite heavily flavoured with a deep honey syrup.    I have never been a particular fan of the Chinese double boiled soups so our second course of double boiled fish maw/conpoy/sea whelk soup wasn’t something I looked forward to. That said the broth had the flavours expected and it wasn’t unpleasant. It was a large bowl and the broth was very hot when presented. One of the reasons why I don’t particularly enjoy this type of soup is that the ingredients - usually enjoyable going in - lose their attraction in the broth having had their flavours transferred.    Our replacement dish was braised sea bass with Chinese kale in a light ginger sauce. The fish was beautifully prepared, delicate but retained its texture. The Kale was perfect too. Highly enjoyable replacement course if a little lacking in flair. Execution was flawless.    The baked lobster with mozzarella I confess to not regarding as Chinese but it was beautiful and flavoured well. I am glad they didn’t choose a stronger flavoured cheese as that tends to mask the lobster.    The Wagyu beef fried rice was disappointing. Fried rice when done well can shine through as a memorable course but this bowl of rice lacked flavour and the diced beef came through as tough. Using the table condiments to spruce it up only served to highlight how this course didn’t live up to expectations.    Lastly dessert was freshly cut fruit and mini egg tart with a piece of osmanthus jelly. The egg tart’s flaky casing was slightly overdone but it was enjoyable nonetheless. As for cut fruit - see below.    I confess that I feel let down by this meal. For a 3 Michelin starred restaurant it lacked sparkle and flair. There were some inspirational moments - eg the starter and the lobster - but there were execution misses too - the egg tart and the wagyu beef fried rice. As for freshly cut fruit - a Michelin starred restaurant offering cut fruit - smacks of not trying. I can get that experience by buying myself a mixed fruit box from the local market!    I will commend the restaurant for not hiking prices which other 3 starred eateries have done but I would suggest that Tang Court cannot justify its 3 stars based on the meal we had. Sadly I struggle with it being awarded a single star.    Our main waiter was nonetheless friendly, knowledgeable, engaged and helpful throughout."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,A very traditional Cantonese Restaurant that focuses on food quality,"This 3-starred Michelin Cantonese restaurant is always controversial. If you are looking for fancy food presentation and impeccable service, T'ang court is unlikely what you are looking for. While you think the food quality outweighs everything, do come for a try.    Crab shell here is always described as the best crab shell in Hong Kong. I highly agree in term of its appearance, ingredient and taste. Peking duck is a must-try. Pre-order is recommended.    You might notice the service is comparatively weaker than that of other hotel managed Michelin Cantonese restaurants, such as Lung King Heen and Tin Lung Heen. Staffs seldom introduced and explained dishes, but still willing to answer my questions when I voluntarily asked for.    Don't expect a very pleasant food presentation that is prefect for uploading to Instagram. This is not the style of T'ang Court.    A great dining experience, just not as fancy as some other 2 or 3 starred Michelin starred Cantonese restaurants."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,"Delicious foods, quiet environment, good services","Tang Court is a Michelin 3 star restaurant, but not much marketing like some other overwhelming 3 stars. However, the foods may be better than some overwhelming ones. The foods are very fresh and in high quality. I am not expert in cooking technique and skills, but I think the dishes are delicious.    The environment is spacious, quiet, with not much decoration and view. The staff are also in high standard.    Baked stuffed crab shell, grouper, baked oyster with port wine are recommended."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",10,"old facilities, bad service,","old facilities, bad service, food is alright but absolutely not ready to open for business. I was told most food are sold out and they don’t have alternative for me other than keep saying sorry extremely terrible. Tables are not wrap up even customers left for ages. And very unfortunate for one thing that table next to me is loud and noisy like I was in a low class yumcha place. Not worth any titles and not worth coming back to suffer"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Birthday Dinner and Staycation,Michelin 3 star restaurant with a theme everything Tang Dynasty. I can't say enough about the presentation and the various sensory stimulus. You can tell the effort that has been made. Even the strange decor of the dining room (East Coast American Country Club meets 70s Las Vegas).    The food was very good and flavourful and a good blend of modern and classical evidenced by the enjoyment from my 78yr old mother hates all things modern.    We had the suckling pig and a course of abalone with various vegetables. All great. Impressive tea menu as well.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",40,Enjoyable but underwhelming for 3 Michelin stars,"A lovely environment with exceptional service and good food, but we found it underwhelming given it has been awarded 3 Michelin stars. They kindly offered half portions as we were only two, and offered to adjust dim sum portions to 2 or 4 pieces. This was very much appreciated.    A painting of rotting strawberries is an interesting choice for a restaurant!    We ate:  Fried spare ribs with garlic, spicy salt and chilli - This was a thick and much more fatty slice of pork than expected. This meant the flavour and texture of the fat overpowered the meat and seasoning    Sautéed cashew nuts, water chest nuts and mushrooms in taro nest - all ingredients were cooked perfectly, retaining beautiful colour and texture however it was under-seasoned and a little oily.    Fried flat noodles with beef, black bean, red and green peppers - Sadly a little oily and less black bean flavour than was expected.    We also had a selection of dim sum:  The wagyu beef pastries were divine and definitely the highlight of the meal. The perfect crispy and melt-in-the-mouth pasty combined with flavourful filling.    Steamed prawn dumplings, and the pork and Yunnan ham dumplings were tasty but nothing memorable    For dessert we had the mango and pomelo sago pudding and sticky rice, red bean and peanut rolls. The sago pudding was probably the best I’ve ever had. The sticky rice roll was nice but nothing special.    Overall - if the 8 dishes we had I would only order two of them again."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",40,It was good but not perfect!,It was good but not perfect! 片皮雞 was special ! 寶盒飯 is recommended! But the service is not perfect! No shorts and slippers!

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Mother’s Day Dinner,Never disappointing our taste buds and olfactory sense. Cozy and quiet dining room. Perfectly matched food ingredients and condiments. Attentive and friendly service. Highly recommended. One of two Michelin 3-starred Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong. Happy Mother’s Day!

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",10,This does not even deserve a single star,"I am clueless...this was one of the worst fine dinning experiense of my life. Simply becaise this place has nothing 'fine' the tasting menu is full of bland dishes. You start with a crab meat shell that could have been cooked at any canteen no taste whatsoever. Then you have the bird nest which is maybe the only elaborated dish in the menu. So then you think ""nice they are picking up"" but then the bigest disapointment: the lobster with chicken broth.... No seasoning.. No creativity... They do not even make the effort to unshell it because then you would have to do a proper presentation. After that you have the wagyu that is totally overcooked like a vuglgar random steak... And to finish the fried rice. Whether you like abalone or not... Up to you... But the rice is like everything else there : bland and without the single creativity (they tried to put duck inside but you could not even taste it).  I almost forgot... The ultimate insult: the fruit plater. Chinese food is not famous for its desert... But still if you put fruit do not give us some fruit that could have been straight from welome. They did not even try to do something... Just cutted them and then served.    I would push it saying that every dishes (except the second one) tasted premade and just warmed up...    You have people who work all their life just for a single macaron. For dark reason michelin gave this place 3.... You do not even deserve 1.    Last thing their service is really bad. They keep filling your glass trying to have you drink as much as you can. At the end they asked me if I was full. I was still so hungry could still have had a full set... I said ""it was a bit light""... The aswer I had : 'you can order more'. The concept of a tasting menu is to be full at the end.    An insult for fine dining and for chinese cuisine: People who think that all they need to do is to put expensive ingredient in your plate... There is no cooking effort made whatsoever    PS:i love and I am passionate about chinese cuisine. At this level of mediocrity it cannot be a misunderstanding"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Invaluable dining experience,"This is our first time to go to this Chinese restaurant for the friend gathering. We had an amazing dining experience at this restaurant, the food items are excellent and service is wonderful!    All the staffs are well trained and attentive at detail. I will definitely come back and recommend it to my friends.    Last but not least, I would like to say thank you to Jessica and Michael for the hospitality to make our Gathering unforgettable."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",40,One of the best dim sums in Kowloon,"I love dim sums. Lung King Heen is my favourite place for dim sums in Hong Kong Island. However, I don’t go there for the time being after one recent incident relating to COVID-19 in Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong.    I therefore picked T’ang Court as our lunch venue today. Our group of 4 ordered some dim sums, some vegetables and noodles with ginger, scallions and fish maw to share.    All food was good. The following dishes were particularly delicious:    - pan fried turnip cake with XO sauce  - pan fried rice rolls with XO sauce (crispy outside and soft inside)  - noodles with ginger, scallions and fish maw  - steamed vegetable dumplings    We ordered our food at about 13:30. I was a little disappointed when I was told that stuffed beancurd sheet rolls with abalone sauce were already sold out.    Due to the epidemic, the restaurant was quiet as expected. We’re seated in a room on the second floor with another table of customers. I wasn’t sure whether it’s because of our location or the lack of staff or both, the service wasn’t up to the standard expected of restaurant with 3 Michelin stars. A few times I needed to wait for a staff to come to or near our room in order to ask for his/her help. But it’s only a very minor issue on the whole.    I’ll definitely return."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Excellent food and service,"I had dim sum and stuffed crab. There must have been two crabs of fresh crab meat to fill a shell. It was so fresh and must be so much work. We were a party of 3, the restaurant arranges 1 piece of dim sum(every kind) for each of us. The service was attentive, waitress kept changing plates and poured tea. Good to try but be expected to pay for the 3 star service and food"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Absolutely stunning don’t,Absolutely stunning don’t miss this out. 3 star Michelin and amazing food and service. You certainly will not regret it. Wonderful experience all round. Love this restaurant.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",10,How on earth did they earn 3 michelin stars?,There is little about this restaurant that is deserving of one let alone three michelin stars.    The room looks dated and we were seated under blasting cold air con. Staff accommodated us when we asked to be moved. There was no dress code. Diners wore anything from ripped jeans to sports wear.    Food was uninspiring and lacked flavour. Plates were cleared before everyone had finished and there was no thank you or 'goodbye' as we left. The price is the only thing worthy of a michelin star.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",30,Overrated and disappointing,"The space is beautiful. That was the best thing about the night. We ordered the tasting menu to have as comprehensive experience as possible. The Kobe beef and stuffed crab were the highlight. The rest (imperial bird nest soup, abalone, lobster and lotus leaf wrapped fried rice) were bland and very disappointing. Presentation appeal was also absent. Perhaps it was an off night but this experience makes me question the Michelin rating system. I expected so much more. The service was good but lacked the little touches I have enjoyed at “lesser” one star rated, or unrated establishments."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Best meal ever in Hong Kong!,"At the T’ang Court in Hong Kong, a 3 star Michelin restaurant that was worthy of every star! We ordered the tasting menu, and The food was absolutely delicious, from start to finish, and the service was top notch! We would fly back to Hong Kong just for the meal! 💗"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,Delicious treats,"Cosy atmosphere. Personal waiter made it for us to feel really special. My wife does not eat pork and not a big oriental dish fan. Now this time even she enjoyed the series of dishes pretty much. I cannot judge the dufferences betwwen 1, 2 or 3 Michelin szars rwstaurants. I personally think this is rather subjective. But according to our point systwm this was a 10/10:)  All in all unforgettable Chinese dining feast."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,We had lunch at T’ang Court,We had lunch at T’ang Court and it was a fantastic experience. Cantonese Pork was delightful but dim sum was also good. Our server Michael was awesome and made fantastic recommendations and helped make a memorable meal.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",50,When u r looking for good ha-gao,"Going through recent reviews about the restaurant I notice quite a few commented the food to be bland and not much better than what they have from their home country. Also noticed these are mostly foreigners from non Chinese world, who have been brain washed by their local Chinese restaurant with twisted cuisine. No wonder why they could not appreciate the finest taste hidden behind each course carefully crafted by the chef. No you can’t find your General Chow’s chicken or sweet-n-sour duck here. You are in the wrong shop, and the wrong city.    此行真正志在朝圣。个人推荐如下：  虾饺 - 水准实在不错。配上精心挑选的生抽真是锦上添花。好好吃🤤  唐阁宝盒饭 - 平时也不太喜欢吃焗饭，但这个饭一点都不腻。值得一试。👍🏻  椰汁粟米糕 - 基于私人原因一向对椰汁糕有很高的期待。外间把椰汁糕搞到像jelly pudding的texture真是大错特错。这里做得到松、绵、香， 非常难得。 😍    埋单时贪心的又book咗张桌周末来吃brunch。😋"

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",40,Not 3 stars,Great Chinese food and service - But not a 3 star Michelin restaurant even it is priced as 3 star. Maybe 1 star.

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",20,It doesn't deserve a Michelin 3-star award,"There are only 7 restaurants with the 3-star award in Hong Kong. That's why I have picked T'ang Court for celebration for the 70th birthday of my mother on 20 November 2019.    However, the experience was disappointing which falls well below the expectation of a Michelin 3-star restaurant. We ordered a dish of Rice with eel and were warned ahead that this dish took around 1 hour to prepare and we accepted it.    Half an hour later, another dish of fried eel with pepper was served and the waitress admitted that she took the order wrongly and apologized for making the mistake. Minutes later, we were told that the last portion of eel was used to prepare the fried eel and it was impossible to prepare another dish of rice with eel. This mistake was already unacceptable and what shocked us was the attitude of the waitress. She kept holding the dish of fried eel and pushing us to accept it instead despite the fact that it was obviously not the intended dish. She did not even offer this was complimentary to act as courtesy.    We felt this service did not deserve the fame of a 3-star restaurant which we expect perfection not only in the taste of the dishes but also the standard of the service. We were truly disappointed by this experience.    Think twice before you believed in this Michelin 3-star restaurant. It doesn't deserve the price and fame."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",30,"Service fantastic, I wish the food was as good.","From the greeting at the entrance to the table the atmosphere was very beautiful and I felt very special, considering I was eating alone. I received a giant menu with many choice including a few Prix Fixe tasting menus. I choose the menu with the wine pairing, since I was not sure of the cuisine, I thought this would be a good overview.  I was surprised, the food was quite bland. They gave me an assortment of chilis, but I was not sure how or when to use them. I did added a little too the soup and it was so much better. But form a diner who eats a many restaurants around the world, I felt guilty, in other countries the way you receive the dish is how the chef wants it to taste. If this is not the case we should have received more instruction.  The service was superior, I just wish the food was also. Luckily I received this dinner as a gift, so I did not pay for it, but if I had I would be quite disappointed."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",20,My wife and I visited for,"My wife and I visited for lunch and had the set menu. I’d read the inconsistent reviews and I wanted more of a sample than a full experience. However the lunch set menu was ample. The place itself is beautiful and the service is slightly above average. The food was really disappointing however. Regardless of the 3 Michelin stars I’ve had better chinese food elsewhere in Sydney. The dim sum was very nice, a crab and avocado spring roll the highlight but for 3 Michelin stars I’m expecting more than a decent dim sum dish. Having eaten at the fabulous l’enclume in the UK a week previously which holds 2 stars, the difference in quality was vast. I am bemused how this is recognised in the Michelin Guide."

"T'ang Court - The Langham, Hong Kong",20,Very medicore surprised it holds a 3*,"To start this review I am a female solo diner foodie. I had the tasting menu with wine pairing. I am also English. To my personal tate buds I found most dishes a bit lacking in flavour and deffinatly in presentation. I have been to many michilin and rosette restaurants and I think this is my least favourite. Which is very annoying as my meal was £220. My server was lovely, explained the dishes, and even gave a cheeky top up twice on my wine pairing. Which is always welcome so thankyou. But with the wine 2 of the bottles I had I can buy from my local supermarket which was very dissapointing as you expect an eclectic verity from michilin restaurants. The chateau le marechaux and lanson brute are very standard medium priced wines for the experience I am having in my taste. Of course I'm not in England and I am in Hong Kong but I was made aware some of the best dining in the world was here. Such a shame but good service which saved it! Also the desert was a bit bleh £220 for a fruit platter. Taking the piss."

Le Bernardin,30,Don’t waste your money!,"Quite a bizarre experience at Le Bernadin and we were really looking forward to the evening.  I’ll start with the actual dining room. Underwhelming, large and the layout gives you the feeling that you’re in a dining hall rather than an intimate exclusive restaurant.  The food. We had the full tasting menu with wine pairing. The bread was awful. I always look forward to the bread because usually in good restaurants you get good bread. The so called baguettes could’ve been a frozen one from Lidl. In fact that would be insulting to Lidl. Extremely poor quality.  Most of the dishes excluding the mains of Fluke and Halibut were delicious pretty much a 10/10. The two main dishes however were a big fail. Seriously not good at all.  What was almost shocking about this restaurant was the service. Ok, it was like a well oiled machine. You didn’t want for anything and everyone went around their business perfectly in sync but with absolutely ZERO interaction with us. Rushed, clinical, robotic, cold and unsmiling. Totally bizarre. We had a 8-10 course dinner and we were in and out in less than two hours. We would NEVER come back here again. For 1200dollars there are a million and one other restaurants to go to for a quarter of the price and sensational service and food. Can’t believe you have 3 stars."

Le Bernardin,50,Worth the Trip.,"It had been twenty years since the last visit  Anticipation fueled my food lust and heightened  the trip to NYC leaving me eager to feel and taste.  It’s a pleasure and a satisfaction to be seated and  made ready to enjoy. The table top screams the  confidence of the house and the French cuisine does the  same. Whether it’s the stunning Caviar or perfect Fluke  the plate grabs the imagination. The table took the  menu which leaves freedom to converse and critique.  By the end of the eight plates almost every point of  light had been touched and savored. Impeccable.  There is a dryness though to service that slips into an  almost flat finale. It is hard to maintain. This however  is Le Bernardin so it’s expected. This is the restaurant  that the French hold dear and champion for all time.  My first such restaurant was La Table des Cordeliers  in Condom, Gers, France in 1976. Rarely do I get to be  reminded of that place and that time. I do by Le Bernardin."

Le Bernardin,40,Not three stars,"I was underwhelmed by the restaurant. Maybe it is the black bass I ordered, but it is just like any fish in any fine dining restaurant. I was expecting to be wowed in the three michelin star restaurant. My partner, she tasted sand in her scallop, which is unacceptable. I don't know, maybe my expectations are too high."

Le Bernardin,50,Fabulous!,"We had lunch and what a lunch! Tasting menu with wine pairings, everything flows and dances in your mouth.  From the halibut and the langoustine to the scallops and the Maine lobster, it is just divine!  Enough with the food, it is too good to describe, you need to experience it!  The service is spectacular. From the front door to the table, it is a sumptuous ballet of professional minds.  There is a reason Le Bernardin has 3 stars, it is perfect!"

Le Bernardin,50,Barbara turned a 3 star into a 4 star,We opted for Le Bernadin for my birthday. There is simply no place better with fish. Today was no exception. The food and service was outstanding.  I hesitated to write this since it seems only negative reviews are marked helpful. But I had to tell someone about our sommelier Barbara. Her contribution (and the wines) put the meal over the top. We had the 8 course tasting menu with wine. Barbara said we would each get the equivalent of a bottle of wine. She sensed this was more wine than we would want and said she could pare it back and still match it up. So we had our champagne followed by magical pairings and were still able to walk out. All 3 stars have great food. What sets them apart is the”of course you can” attitude as  exemplified by Barbara. She sensed what we wanted and made it happen.

Le Bernardin,40,A 'reluctant' Michelin 3* offering inconsistent dishes from spectecular to just so-so!,"Michelin 3 stars, New York Times 4 stars, La Liste joint #1 Restaurant in the World, San Pellegrino World’s Best 50 Restaurant List……….etc, etc.    Since its opening over 3 decades ago, continuous culinary accolades and awards had been pouring in for this New York gastronomic temple. As such, with such stellar credentials, to most of the gourmands in our party, a meal at this iconic institution has become the most anticipated foodie event of the year, if not in their young life?!    For lunch, two dining options were offered. First, a full blown USD300+, 8 course chef tasting menu that the whole table has to participate in. Alternatively, a protracted, reduced 3 course table d’hote made up the other option. Though it would be enticing to savor so many of Chef Ripert’s creations all at once, however, to Rosy, having an 8 course tasting menu so early in the day was too much of a daunting task. Consequently, the entire party settled for the reduced course alternative.    Our selected luncheon option followed a formidable and challenging format. For the first course, patrons were requested to pick a single dish from a list of nearly 20 imaginative, mouth watering and unique, ‘almost raw or barely touched‘, seafood creations. For the main course, 8 ‘lightly cooked’ seafood and fish masterpieces were offered. Man! So many selections to choose from!..talk about information overload and tough decisions making!..Maybe a nice task for ChatGPT?! Ha!    Our fun yet frustrating evaluation and selective process yielded the following first, main and dessert course options:    AMUSE BOUCHE:    Salmon Rillette; Sourdough Bread Crisp.  BREAD SERVICE:    4 Bread Samples ( Brioche, Baguette, Walnut & Raisins……plus  Normandy Butter )  FIRST COURSE:    Shellfish Medley  Uni, Razor Clams, Langoustine, Mirugai, Shrimp Custard, Smoked  Pork Dashi Broth.  Bacalao  Warm Bacalao Escabeche under a cloud of Saffron Brandade  MAIN COURSE    Dover Sole  Pan roasted Dover Sole, Green Olives, Toasted Almonds, Aged  Sherry Wine Emulsion.  Fluke  Pan seared Fluke, Twice Baked Mini Potatoes, Urchin-  Bouillabaisse Emulsion  Hiramasa  Grilled Hiramasa, Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, Bone Marrow -  Red Wine Bordelaise  DESSERT    Baba Au Whiskey - Purple Sweet Potato ‘Baba’, Caramelized  Pecan, Smoked Okinawa Sugar Ice Cream  Citrus ‘Madeleine’ - Vanilla Genoise Sponge, Lemon Mousseline,  Berry Medley  Peruvian Dark Chocolate - Warm Peruvian Chocolate Tart, Tahitian  Vanilla Ice Cream  Corn - Sweet Corn Mille-Feuille, Salted Caramel Sauce  Sorbet - Poire William  So! What is the overall verdict? Was the quality of the food superb and distinctive enough to exude the degree of greatness that commensurates with a Michelin 3* plus other preeminent ratings and accolades that were bestowed upon it?    For this, one has to evaluate and critique from the viewpoint of Chef Eric Ripert’s philosophy towards treating and preparing fish and seafood. In short, Chef Ripert loves to adopt a ‘simple’ approach to cooking fish, treating the natural ingredients with respect and letting the characteristic shine on its own. Based on this, ingredients used in each and every one of our dishes were prepared and executed flawlessly and with loving care by the talented kitchen. So, the answer is a resounding ‘Yes’!    Accompanying sauces or seasoning, where necessary, were well-balanced and care was taken not to overpower the main ingredients……. Though in some cases, may be a touch too conservative and overly cautious? These were reflected by the ‘too delicate‘ taste profile of the Seafood Medley and the underwhelming, ‘taste lacking’ Bordelaise sauce accompaniment for the Hiramasa dish. On the other hand, the Dover Sole and the Fluke were simply amazing, totally worthy as Michelin 3* offerings. I have lived and worked in Britain and France for over a decade and have had my fair share of well executed Dover Soles. However, this Le Bernardin’s rendition was heads and shoulders above the rest, both in taste, degree of doneness and texture……the best and tastiest ( western style preparation ) Dover Sole I have come across.  In this scenario, the pros canceled the cons resulting in a no-decision!    Dessert courses were one of the best and spectacular collections I have come across ( the other, Robuchon au Dome in Macau ).    Overall atmosphere in my opinion was a bit stuffy and pretentious. Front-of-house a touch dim and under-lite.    Service, though efficient, lacked smile and enthusiasm.    So, in conclusion, is Le Bernardin worthy of its Michelin 3* status? The answer is a reluctant Yes……more like 70% three stars and 30% two stars. As for the #1 rating on La Liste?! This I beg to differ, noting quite a few Michelin establishments I have frequented in Europe and the Orient ( especially Japan and Hong Kong ) offered better overall dining experiences."

Le Bernardin,50,Superb dining experience,"Yes, its elegant, yes its pricey and, yes, Le Bernadin lives up to its reputation. Excellent service and absolutely superb food. Presentation is perfection here, but quality is also key to seafood dishes that are deliciously delicate. There is a chef's tasting menu as well as an extensive a la carte--choose 4. A splendid experience."

Le Bernardin,50,Best Fine Dining Experience,"This is the only 3 star Michelin restaurant in NYC that caters to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.    Ambiance: I love the subtle decor of the restaurant. It is very elegant and refined and I love the different utensils and plate ware that the restaurant carries.    Food: My review of the food is based on the experience with the 8 course veggie tasting menu. All the dishes were delicious and unique. I don't think I've ever had vegetables cooked to such a perfect temperature and consistency. The food was plated beautifully as well. The desserts were so unique and each bite held a different taste and surprise. From the guests who joined me, they felt that all the non-vegetarian food was also delicious and exceeded expectations.    Service: The service is excellent and staff were very attentive. Everyone was very friendly from the individual who called us to offer us an earlier dinner time to the hostess and service staff.    Price: Considering the 3 star status, I would say the 8 course tasting menu was priced reasonably. I also love that they price the vegetarian tasting menu lower so that it feels fair. It's one of the few restaurants who actually does this.    Overall, one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had."

Le Bernardin,50,Sublime dining,"We had high expectations and all were met. The staff was extremely friendly and engaging throughout dinner. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings, but started with a Kir Royale and followed with caviar and chilled vodka before dinner service. We both enjoyed every dish and my husband usually dislikes fish; he raves this is the best seafood he’s ever had. I have to agree. The sauces were flawless and each fish course was perfectly prepared. We look forward to eating here again soon."

Le Bernardin,30,Worthy but not Overwhelming,"Dined with friends and family on September 18th. We had the 4-course experience. Started out with a Manhattan. It was quite disappointing as I do not believe that they keep the whisky in the freezer, thus, being able to create a perfect Manhattan made perfectly. A warm Manhattan is short of the mark. I came in with an open mind and great expectations as this is my first 3-star dining experience. The sauces that came with the fish servings were the highlight of each course. Serving size was adequate. The wines were descent but nothing special. I was hoping for the best fish meal I ever had but that did not happen. The best fish dining experiences I have ever had were in Howth Ireland (Crabby Joes) and Coeur d'Alene Idaho (Paddy's sports Bar). At least I can say I dined in a 3-Star Michelin Restuarant."

Le Bernardin,50,I loved Le Bernadin,I'm a vegetarian and tried the 4 course prix fixed. The artichoke appetizer was refreshing and had so much flavor. The mushroom pasta dish was so delicious. And the hazelnut dessert and corn ice cream was also just wonderful wonderful

Le Bernardin,50,"Perfect,...again","This was my second experience and just like the first, it was perfection. The team at Le Bernardin are incredibly consistent. Service, food, presentation, attention to detail and value were all spot on. You cannot do better than Le Bernardin for a true 3 Michelin star dining EXPERIENCE."

Le Bernardin,50,New York's best restaurant without a doubt,New York's undoubtedly #1 restaurant of all times. Do get the tasting menu and get it with wine pairing. It's a once in a lifetime experience. It's mostly based on fish and seafood.

Le Bernardin,30,Disappointed,"For this to be rated a three Michelin star restaurant it fell way short of my expectations. Above all theatrics or service or whatever involves being rated by Michelin the food simply has to taste good & for the most part this food was bland. I think the theology is that the fish should be the flavor but it could’ve used some seasoning to some dishes. Also the mere lunch will run you upwards of $200 & while I’m nowhere near cheap it angers me when I’m spend this amount of money & im not floored by the food. There are some positives such as my first course was actually tasty, possibly due to the truffle, & my mock tail was also delicious. The entrees & desserts could use some tlc though. Service was top notch but again all of this is irrelevant when the food isn’t amazing"

Le Bernardin,40,Dishes are visually stunning,"This was my second visit to Le Bernardin -- and the first visit cannot be topped since we actually saw Eric Ripert. From what I understand, he's away this month, which was a disappointment. In terms of the food, which is what really matters, most of the dishes are absolutely visually stunning. Surprisingly, the filet mignon, a non-seafood dish, was delicious. But of all the dishes, the strawberry meringue dessert actually made us gasp because it was so beautifully presented, and ended up being enjoyable to eat as well. Unfortunately the other (seafood) dishes were tasty, but not as remarkable or memorable taste-wise. The amuse-bouche was salmon salad (like tuna salad)0 on toast. It was still a positive experience, but slightly disappointing since seafood is supposed to be their strength."

Le Bernardin,40,"Very good, but not perfect","I was thinking about giving 5/5 but my wife had a few additional observations and the final conclusion is 4/5.  Le Bernardin was a wonderful experience. We're ordinary people, but not without experience from Michelin star restaurants. We don't do this all the time and therefore we're always looking for something special and exceptional. The dining room is simply beautiful. However, it's basically one big room, so not very intimate. There's naturally a lot of staff and the overall impression is a bit busy. Our table wasn't the best available, close to the entrance, which emphasized the feeling of being in the middle of traffic. On the other hand, it's NYC, so it's in the DNA of the city. Staff was very professional and made us feel comfortable. The pace of service was quite fast and we were served by a lot of different people, but again, it's NYC.  Food was excellent, of course. Nothing to complain as such. Compared with other top-end restaurants, the menu was playing safe, not too innovative or risky. For someone looking for hard core avant-garde, it was perhaps even too unsurprising, but that's more about personal preferences. Both the menu and the wine pairing were very European. I fully understand that knowing Mr. Ripert's background, but we were slightly surprised to see e.g. no Californian wines. Again, not a question of good/bad, just a personal observation.  Overall impression was very positive and the reason for not giving 5/5 is simply because the bar was set so high. Reducing one point doesn't indicate that there was something wrong, but reflects a personal view that somethings could have been different. We truly enjoyed or visit and would certainly do it again."

Le Bernardin,30,Excellent food overshadowed by the average service,"Le Bernardin, you got 3 Michelin stars. As such, I expect also that level of attention and not just cuisine. Let me start with the important part: food was amazing. Dishes were perfectly seasoned, well balanced and just right. I truly enjoyed every bite, except for the last savory dish: the halibut. Why? Because it was not a pescatarian dish. The sauce bourguignonne was a reduction of beef stock and bacon. Needless to say, I stated in the reservation that I do not eat land animals. When I pointed this out, I was told to say so when I sat down and was asked for allergies. Seriously? You are blaming this faux pas on the customer? A simple apology would have been just right. No need to redo or replace. Frankly, after having eaten at many restaurants around the globe, I was somewhat stunned by that arrogance. And while we are at it: One slice of the olive bread had a nice 3 in black hair. Can't be mine, because... drumroll... I shave my head and have no hair. While mistakes like the hair can happen, how one reacts to the customer can swiftly make the worst mistakes acceptable. Not here. I will be back, and we shall see if Eric's wonderful restaurant lives up to the name and accolades."

Le Bernardin,50,The best meal of my life,I have eaten at a lot of restaurants but never a 3 Michelin star restaurant. It was incredible.    Booking was on Resy and I was able to get a table easily.    The service was excellent. Everyone was so welcoming and professional. The sommelier was outstanding - matched every course with some excellent and interesting wines.    The menu is delicious. We did not think we could manage the tasting menu so went for 4 courses (also a challenge!). I had the tuna and foie gras which was just perfect. I often think about that course and it makes me so happy! The fluke was to die for. Absolutely perfectly cooked. The dessert was also just sublime - a hazelnut chocolate deliciousness!    It is quite pricey but it is more than worth it. Such an experience!

Le Bernardin,50,Excellent!,I had the tasting menu here at Le Bernardin a while ago and loved it. Now their 3-course lunch is also excellent. All dishes are carefully crafted and well executed with creativity while not overly expressive.  A good news is that they do offer their tasting menu for lunch as well. I will certainly be back for that.

Le Bernardin,40,Great experience,"The restaurant is kind of old looking with carpet, it doesn’t give you a feel of a luxurious place. Service was excellent. Food was extraordinary. We went on a weeknight and place was full. You have to make reservation months ahead. The presentation of food was very good. Started with amuse bouche with seafood variations and we had 4 course dinner. Also they serve amuse bouche before desert and at the end they brought a small plate of variety of chocolates. It was too much food to eat. They should also consider to serve 3 course dinner as we felt full and didn’t enjoy much the third and forth course or they should consider smaller portions for less price as it was very pricy."

Le Bernardin,50,One of THE Best Restaurants in NYC,"We always wanted to eat a Michelin starred restaurant. Go big or go home, so we went right for a 3-star. Ranked in the top 50 in the entire world. That’s pretty impressive.  The menu is prix fixe and as we were there for lunch we ate off their lunch prix fixe menu. That included two dishes and a dessert, which was a little unclear on the website. The host or maitre d were pleasant enough. Our wait staff seemed a bit annoyed, which was disappointing. The winner was our sommelier. Their wine menu is VERY overwhelming, but beautifully constructed. He learned what wine we typically enjoy and based on our menu selection recommended a unique and interesting wine we could normally not get in our neck of the woods.    Our first course, my wife had the sautéed shrimp and I had the shellfish medley. Both dishes were beautifully plated. My wife’s shrimp were the best prepared shrimp we’ve ever had. Unfortunately my shellfish medley was not that enjoyable. There were elements of it that were nice like the smoked pork dashi broth. However, there was a fishiness to it that prevented the dish from feeling completed.    Our main course, my wife had the salmon in a gazpacho consommé. Boom!!! This dish was the winner of our meal. Light, fresh, summery dish that just came together with every bite. I am not a fan of salmon, but this was so meticulously done to perfection. Wow! I ordered the striped bass with stuffed zucchini flowers. I am a sucker for stuffed zucchini flowers and this dish did not disappoint. What looked liked the flower stems were a purée of some kind that really balanced the dish out nicely between the strong mushrooms and the mild fish.    Dessert was a superb. My wife opted for the carrot cupcake and I ordered the honey dessert. Yozer wozer!! Beautiful on both counts, but even more impressively delicious.    At the end it was a pleasure to meet chef Eric Ripert. He is truly a legend in the kitchen. His restaurant is nothing short of a gastronomical art gallery."

Le Bernardin,50,Great luncheon for our 41st wedding anniversary,"We thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary lunch at Le Bernardin. Service was friendly and all our questions were answered promptly. The sommelier was helpful and added to our perfect experience. And oh, the food…..simple, fresh, amazing flavors. Anything you order will make you happy. So, thank you to the cheerful and knowledgeable staff of this famous restaurant; well deserved three Michelin stars!"

Le Bernardin,30,It May Just be Me,"In the last month, my family returned to several Michelin rated restaurants in Paris and New York. They all have suffered the same fate. The service has been impeccable, the presentation au currant and the food bland. Actually, bland is worse than bad. Bad begs to be bettered, bland just limps along. Bad is poor quality and or technique. Bland is a lack of pride, perhaps a fear of failure or maybe, as my daughter says, I just like too much salt."

Le Bernardin,50,Simply wonderful,"Without any hesitation .I can say that Le Bernadin is, by far, the best restaurant in the USA that I have dined in. I have eaten here a number of times since its opening , either on business with various size groups, or with my spouse, and it has never been less than extraordinary. Additionally, the service, at all positions is exemplary. The wine list is world class and the cocktails are excellent as well. There are even modestly priced wines by the glass on offer and the sommelier is gracious choosing and serving wines at every price category. If my memory serves me correctly, the original chef, who was the brother (now long deceased) of one of the current owners was one of the first, if not the first, to introduce fish dishes which were not overcooked or baked, as was the practice at the time. His sister, an owner, and his original co chef, now chef, have continued and perhaps surpassed, the experience.  This is fine dining at its best in beautiful surroundings."

Le Bernardin,50,Excellent experience,"My husband and I had a wonderful meal yesterday at Le Bernardin. It never disappoints. We had tuna and shrimp appetizers and salmon and merluza main course. Finished with delicious desserts. The entire staff has always been professional, helpful in describing dishes and recommending wines. Thank you to all the people that we came across, in particular Kevin who was kind, professional, knowledgeable, and friendly, making our meal a great one to remember. We will be back."

Le Bernardin,50,... best dessert in town?,"We had a lovely meal. It lives up to its name and more. I am excited to see where Chef Thomas Raquel goes from here. Big, big fan."

Le Bernardin,50,Unforgettable Night!,"My dream to visit and dine at Le Bernadin and it came true! My husband had time wrong but we were seated at the bar for a few moments, maybe 1 minute by the time our table was ready. When we stood up to go, the one and only Chef Eric Ripert was standing with his hosts. When I finally was able to speak, I asked for a photo and he was so kind and said yes! Once we sat, we were greeted by several people to discuss food, allergies, wines etc. each person with their purpose and that was to take complete care of my husband and me.  We decided on the chefs tasting menu and we were blown away. Prior to the first course, we were offered a choice of bread and I’ll tell you it was hard not to ask for them to leave the whole thing. Delicious and so fresh! The courses begin and one by one the beauty and elegance and flavor was more than we could ever imagine also, these tastings seemed like full glasses. The entire meal was so special and definitely requires a chefs kiss. Thank you for an unforgettable evening of flavor, beauty and great attention to detail."

Le Bernardin,50,Nearly sublime,"Anyone rating this restaurant as anything other than superb in comparison to almost any other restaurant in Manhattan has either a chip on their shoulder or is culinarily ignorant. That said, Le Bernardin is not culinarily superb when it comes to imparting a feeling that the diner is gettiing a dining experience that is unique to that diner. For that, I remember a tasting menu long ago at NOBU. Never again at any restaurant I have felt that personally pampered. I guess, though, if I want that I should hire my own personal chef. In the meantime, Le Bernardin will suffice."

Le Bernardin,50,"Still classic, ageless, timeless","I am a bit of a tasting menu junkie, and have had my share over the years both domestic and internationally. If I had to choose just one, it would be Le Bernardin, which has remained classic, ageless and timeless for over 35 years, with Eric Ripert at the helm for nearly the entire time. Reservations remain a challenge to secure. They are released one month ahead beginning at 7 am ET the first of each month, so for me that was 4 am PT. Of course, Le Bernardin remains a seafood-centric restaurant, with beef or fowl served only ""upon request"".    For dinner, Le Bernardin offers a Chef's Tasting Menu of 8 courses for $298 (with an optional wine pairing available) or a Prix Fixe 4-course menu for $198, with several choices for each course. Lunch is a 3-course Prix Fixe for $120. Post-pandemic, the restaurant no longer requires jackets for gentlemen, but many diners still wear them, as did I.    I of course opted for the Chef's Tasting Menu. When I came last year, I believe there were 2 tasting menus; one was seasonal, the other was Le Bernardin ""classics"". I went with the classic one then, which was outstanding. This time there was just the seasonal menu, but it was equally memorable. The meal included: tuna-sea urchin toast, scallop with caviar, poached lobster, sautéed langoustine, pan-roasted dover sole, steamed halibut. poached rhubarb and pistachio praline. Interestingly, the tuna-sea urchin and halibut had beef-based sauces. The bread basket was delicious as usual, with 4 all-you-can-eat choices (brioche, baguette, raisin-walnut and rosemary olive).    Service was of course excellent. Another fine meal to cap off my weeklong NYC visit."

Le Bernardin,50,wonderful,"always been magnificent, and you have Maguy and Eric. You also have the wonderul ocean spray painting on the wall, and great wines, including Gruner Veltliner from Austria"

Le Bernardin,50,This restaurant sets the bar high,Our multigenerational graduation celebration was perfect from the amuse bouche through our generous four courses to the petit fours that followed dessert. Impeccable service without being unctuous or overbearing. Each dish was tastier than the previous one.

Le Bernardin,50,Every Dish is a Star,"Even if this restaurant had no Michelin stars (which it does-3 to be exact) every dish I had for dinner was a star all by itself. And dish after dish, my expression was the same, “Wow!”  But good food is not the only star performer here. The service staff that served our meal was friendly, knowledgeable, made great wine and beverage suggestions and generally just made the whole experience that much better.    Will I go back…DEFINITELY! It as good as dining gets anywhere in the world."

Le Bernardin,50,Wonderful,"We adored the vegetable tasting menu with paired wines. We were seated near the window, looking out into the room (no looking into walls), loved everything we were served, enjoyed the waitstaff and just thought the whole experience was delightful. Next time we're in NYC we'll go back."

Le Bernardin,50,A very good experience,"It was my first time to have lunch at this restaurant, which is located in the heart of Manhattan. As soon as you arrive, you can feel you are in a different place, with the elegant and sophisticated decor, Chef Eric Ripert walking around the restaurant to make sure the service and food is up to standard, and the whole team is very dedicated to making sure you have the best time!"

Le Bernardin,50,What a difference Cary made for our dinner at Le Bernardin!!,"We were here for a previously-cancelled anniversary dinner (Covid.) Couldn't get a dinner reservation, but luckily scored two seats at the lounge bar. Our bartender/server was incredible. Cary was so welcoming, so thoughtful, and so engaging; he made our night. The food was as delicious as expected, but the experience was, thanks largely to Cary, spot on. Even Eric Ripert was in the lounge that night, sitting right behind us with some other guests. Great evening all around. Thank you, Cary."

Le Bernardin,50,Excellent In Every Way,"I cannot rave enough about Le Bernardin. A restaurant that touches on many senses. Beautifully plated delicious food , elegant decor and professional staff. I personally do not eat raw seafood, so I specifically go for the Excellent vegetarian tasting menu and the desserts! The artichoke appetizer is by far my favorite item on the menu. Since everyone had to do the vegetarian option we decided to just go with the regular prix fixed menu since my son did not want to do the vegetarian tasting menu. I still had the artichoke appetizer followed by the Dover sole and finished it with the honey panna cotta. The service was seamless and our waiter was so patient with us explaining the different types of fish to my son. While Le Bernardin is known for the fresh seafood, you cannot ignore the basket of freshly baked breads and the beautifully decorated desserts. Each dessert is a piece of art. I highly recommend you try this restaurant and enjoy all aspects of it because it truly nourishes your taste buds and your eyesight. I give it my GoldnAdvice seal of approval."

Le Bernardin,50,Top quality and modern,"Formal European style dinner, we enjoyed every dish, in particular the tuna with sea urchin and the tuna with foil gras. The service is very professional but every member of the staff even if extremely competent managed to make everyone very comfortable.  The only thing that I would improve is acustics that because due to the size of the ambiance the noise can be loud at times."

Le Bernardin,50,The Bernadin what Else !!,Service Food Is perfection 3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Well deserved Thanks Eric Next time to see you if you are to busy 👍 Thanks again for this very special diner

Le Bernardin,50,Seafood at the highest level,"We went for the prix fixe lunch menu. The space was classy, with the fantastic ocean scene on the back wall reminding us why we were there. Every dish was beautifully-presented and delicious, using a deft hand to prevent any ingredient from overpowering the star, top-quality seafood. The steamed halibut and Peruvian chocolate tart were highlights. The sommelier, one of three (at lunch nonetheless!) recommended a red Burgundy by the glass that paired wonderfully with the charred octopus and halibut. Attentive but unobtrusive service. A special meal."

Le Bernardin,50,Lived up to every expectation,"This is not just amazing food, this is the highest level of creativity and perfection of execution. The chef’s menu and wine tasting was an incredible experience."

Le Bernardin,50,One word: amazing,"Is it that good? Yes, it is that good. Amazing. This is how an unforgettable experience feels like. Your biggest problem is going to be what you chose. And you cannot go wrong. Thank you Eric."

Le Bernardin,50,Best food I’ve ever eaten,"If you are looking for excellent service, great wine pairing and excellent food then you should book here. Don’t skimp and think the a la carte will do, go for the tasting menu if you can. The scallops in particular are amazing. The reservations are released 7am (EST) on the first for the month ahead. Remember to set an alert to book as close to that time as possible if there’s a particular reservation that you want."

Le Bernardin,50,Lunch was Superb,"I was just ok with my previous visit a few years ago but LOVED the City Harvest lunch menu offerings this past February. I sat at the bar and really enjoyed the exceptional service provided to me by Kosta. I mentioned that I would be attending the matinee for Moulin Rouge ( a must see!) and Kosta assured me he would get me to the musical on time which he did. Both the Moulin Rouge and Summer Wind cocktails were fantastic and I also enjoyed a terrific Riessdorfkolsch beer. Bread assortment is very nice. All 3 courses were perfect, not just excellent but perfect. The $163 (not including gratuity) for what I received was money very well spent and I look forward to Le Bernadin on my next visit to NYC."

Le Bernardin,10,Myth Debunked,"Myth debunked  I have not been to the restaurant for many years and after reading wonderful reviews I thought it a great place to celebrate my wife's 85th birthday. Needless to say it was extremely hard to get a reservation fortunately my American Express platinum card enabled me to get a reservation at 5:45 PM last night.  As I remembered it still is an extremely beautiful place. But after my experience last night I cannot encourage anybody to go to this restaurant - be prepared to spend $500 for such a mediocre experience.  If for some reason you do go do not sit in the rear of the restaurant, there is the entrance to the kitchenand your head will spin with the constant flow of people going in and out- completely distracting dining.  I am 90 years old, been to 57 countries and have eaten in the finest restaurants in the world – this certainly is not one of them. There is a constant interference by waiters and etc. instead of fine unobtrusive service found in fine restaurants/  All of the above could be forgiven if the food lived up to its reputation.  You have two choices to start with followed by one entrée and dessert($185).  To start with we ordered the langostino which was overcooked and sent back. For the entrée i ordered the fluke and after the experience of the starter I asked the waiter please do not overcook it. It came well done, overcooked and tasteless and sent this back, After this 2nd experience I declined ordering anything else. My wife did enjoy her halibut.  For dessert she ordered a Carmel dessert- just adequate.  They only charged me alacart for the items I ate.  At a price which will exceed $250 a person with wine and drinks one would expect much more. It's all about fussiness and the presentation rather than great seafood and elegant service.  Happy 85 to my beautiful wife,"

Le Bernardin,50,Lovely Fall Lunch!,"We were able to have lunch here while in town for a long weekend. We were very pleased with our experience. The staff was very nice. We had some great wine pairings with our courses. Ideally, the seating would be a little more spaced apart but this is NYC where space is at a premium. The food was outstanding. We would definitely return."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Epicurean Symphony: A Culinary Ode to 8 ½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA in Hong Kong,"Residing in the vibrant city of Hong Kong for almost 15 years, the mystique surrounding ""8 ½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA"" as a culinary haven had always intrigued me.    Recently, I decided to unravel this gastronomic gem during a celebratory Saturday lunch, an occasion that demanded meticulous advance reservations.    Umberto Bombana, a luminary in the global culinary panorama, is celebrated for his unwavering commitment to culinary traditions, masterful flavor profiles, and minimalist plating that allows the essence of each ingredient to shine.    Established in 2010 and named after Fellini's iconic film of 1963, coinciding with Chef Bombana's birth year, the restaurant encapsulates the essence of Italian dining, reflected in the translated name ""Otto e Mezzo."" A stroll through the dining rooms reveals an original billboard, a charming nod to the restaurant's cinematic inspiration.    Nestled discreetly in Alexandra House with a panoramic view of Chater Road, the ambiance is a harmonious blend of comfort and elegance. Deep sepia, bronze, and cream hues create a warm palette, while C-shaped booths offer strategic vantage points to appreciate both the surroundings and the impeccable service of the sleek staff.    Collaborating closely with Japanese design studio Design Post, Chef Bombana has curated a contemporary space adorned with understated elegance and simplicity. Original Italian artwork graces the venue, providing visual highlights that enrich the overall experience.    The journey commenced with General Manager Antonello Picchedda, a maestro in wine expertise and a gracious host. His welcoming gesture, a glass of Champagne Agrapart and Fils 7 Crus, set the stage for an opulent luncheon.     The Amuse-bouche unfolded as a poignant moment—a Cold Melon Soup adorned with 48-month Pata Negra, Burrata flakes, and Taggiasca olives. The fragrant and soft melon, cultivated with passion by the Lorenzini family in Mantova, showcased a commitment to local, quality produce.    As our appetizer, the Marinated Tuna Tartare with Basil Emulsion, Yuzu dressing, and Oscietra Caviar, was a masterpiece. The tuna's tenderness and the harmonious blend of flavors were exquisite, with Oscietra Caviar adding a touch of luxury.    A bridge of flavors emerged with the Soave Classico (Vigneti di Foscarino), leading us to the Brittany Blue Lobster. The lobster's tenderness, coupled with the seasonal Roasted Matsutake Mushroom and a 48-hour lobster reduction sauce, revealed a culinary prowess balanced with citrus elements.    Chef Bombana's personal touch graced our table before the main course: Spaghetti Chittara with Sicilian Red King Prawn, Datterino Tomato, and Citrus. The perfectly cooked Felicetti spaghetti and the juicy king prawn were a testament to the culinary finesse on display.    Antonello's wine pairing expertise shone through with the Ribolla Gialla Riserva, Primosic, 2017, a complex orange wine enhancing the experience. Chef Bombana's reputation as the Truffle King found expression in the signature White Truffle Tagliolini, a harmonious blend of truffle, egg pasta, and Parmesan.    Opting for the Veal Tagliata with braised Veal Cheek, roasted mushroom, and pumpkin puree, we were treated to butter-tender perfection. Paired with Brunello di Montalcino, La Mannella, 2016, the dish unfolded as an outstanding culmination of flavors.    A classic Venetian Sgroppino served as a palate cleanser, skillfully prepared at the table, leading us to the enchanting Pumpkin Dessert. Vanilla Cream, roast pumpkin gelato, and pumpkin seeds danced in a symphony of elegance and taste, a perfect balance of tenderness and crunchiness.    Concluding our culinary journey, the Moscadello di Montalcino, Mastro Nanni, 2015, painted the perfect finale—a vivid yellow elixir with honeyed notes, merging seamlessly with peach and apricot undertones.     ""8 ½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA"" transcended its myth, offering not just a meal but an extraordinary odyssey of culinary delight."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,40,Italian with3 stars Michelin,"Excellent service at a high price. Food was tasty and prepared well. Went for the ala carte menu, the abalone carpaccio, marinated langoustine with caviar and uni, shrimp spaghetti,Burrata ravioli, short rib and beef tenderloin, lamb chops and veal parmigiana (not on their menu). All dishes were presented well and tasted good! However, there was no wow! The wine list was extensive while their limoncello soufflé was worth mentioning as a dessert! The restaurant is still popular and fully occupied. Price was in the higher plain! Located in Central, the views is overlooking the Central Area buildings such as the Mandarin-Oriental hotel!"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Excellent as usual,"As what the spirit they keep in their own mind anything was perfect and excellent.  On the one hand, the service quality is on the same level which they always have and they give the feedback to guests as soon as possible.  On the other, at that day, it is the last week for black truffle season, fantastic for any dishes.  Will be back when the time turns on to the white truffle season."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Always a pleasure here,"It's been a while since the last time visit at Otto. And they are still top of the standard. Three stars are well deserved and continually proud of them. This time I had some seasonal dishes like rice salad seafood and black truffle tagliolini. The rice salad seafood is very refreshing and is absolutely something I want for appetizer in this hot summer day. Nevertheless to say, The black truffle tagliolini is the best you can get in town as always. Then I had the beef tenderloin with white asparagus as the main course. The beef is very tender and the portion is just right. Last but not least, I had my all time favorite dessert, hazelnut millefoglie. And this time they have also different petite fours… an incredible presentation on the trolley.. it was a perfect match withan outstanding espresso 100% arabica. We are more than satisfied as always when we walk out the restaurant with many happy staff greetings us. Thank you Otto staff for delighting our dinner with your friendly and professional service as always. We can't wait for our next visit already!"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,20,"Good ambience, decent service, but unworthy of a Michelin star (let alone 3)","My friends and I had lunch at 8 1/2 for lunch today, 16th of June 2023. It was a casual lunch, no special occasion. First time there for me.    My below comments have to be read in the context that this restaurant has, as of today, 3 Michelin stars.    The Pros:  - the distance between tables was very comfortable and, in conjunction with an effective sound proofing, contributed to the restaurant being quiet despite the busy lunch hour.  - the serving of the wine was perfect as far as how and when it should be served.  - the cart of petit fours served after desert was a nice surprise. Plenty of choices.    What was OK:  - the main dining room is nicely decorated. The seats were comfortable, everything on the table was clean and tidy. This was within expectation for a Michelin star restaurant.  - the service was within expectation too. Waiter Jayson was smiling, was well aware of the dishes, attentive to our table, water glasses were refilled regularly, and questions were all answered professionally.  - the quality of the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and bread served was within expectation and tasty.    The Cons:  - although the quality of the ingredients used was good enough, regrettably the dishes themselves lacked creativity and sophistication in both their crafting and flavours. And again, this has to be viewed in the context that this is a 3 Michelin star restaurant.  - the quality for money is, in my opinion, low. More specifically, Restaurant Petrus at Island Shangri-La (*), Gaddis at Penninsula (*) or Caprice at Four Seasons (***), just to cite a few, also rated Michelin star, for the same number of dishes, have their set lunches priced 20% cheaper and the level of sophistication of the dishes is meaningfully higher.  - as you can see from my pictures, the dishes are overall small. Quantities are small even by my light appetite standard. We ordered bread twice.*  - HKD95+10% for a bottle of branded mineral still/sparkling water is a ""tax on the stupids"" (I had checked by email with the restaurant first so was aware of this before coming, so of course we didn't order any). This insidious way to increase the bill on such mundane items - which in HK unfortunately is rampant and isn't specific to 8 1/2 - shouldn't be encouraged by ordering.  - any particular reason why the menu isn't on the restaurant's website ? Client shouldn't have to make the effort to email to get it, this is quite disrepectful.  - menus in a 3 Michelin star restaurant should not include typos. It's ""Gevrey Chambertin"", not ""Gevrey Chmabertin"". Also, the word Cuvée is spelt correctly in certain places of the wine list, and incorrectly in others. Finally, some words are truncated, for example page 3 and 79 in the wine list. Menus, including the wine list, should be checked and rechecked for typos. This, again, is disrespectful of the customer and unfortunately cannot be forgiven at that price point.    Overall:  - my friends and I had a good time as far as gathering between ourselves is concerned, and I am always glad to try a new restaurant. There might be more value in the dinner options perhaps ? This restaurant is rated 3 Michelin star, the chef asks me to pay 3 Michelin star price, and I am happy to do so. In return, my expectation as a customer is that I am being served a 3 Michelin star lunch and regrettably, in this case this did not happen. I cannot find a reason to return, or recommend it to friends. The fine dining scene in HK is very competitive, and there are just too many other, better options to consider.    * edit: unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of my Asparagus starter, the size of which was actually acceptable. Therefore, my comment about the small size of the dishes applies to my main and my desert only."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Run don’t walk,"Another amazing dinner. They are still numero uno among the forty nine Michelin 3 stars that I have been to. The team is simply flawless in their execution, whether it be in the department of cuisine or service. They left me every time yearning for my next visit, and always make me feel like I am dining at a friend’s home. After my dinner on June 20th, I will be having one more encore end of the month before I fly back to US. Then I have to regretfully wait till November for my next encore. Absence makes the heart fonder?"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Great restaurant in Hong Kong,"Excellent for anything especially from the side such as service quality and food .  On the one hand, firstly about the service quality, we do the conversion throughout at least 1 month about making one appointment, deciding dish and asking some details about dish, but they always reply to me quickly and always pay attention to me.  On the other, the owner ( chef as well) is friendly and like to make a photo with customers, moreover, the food with truffle is excellent and it is difficult to tell you how good is."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Authentic Italian food with a modern twist,"Great food and very good service. Love their pasta and cozy environment, would definitely come back to try out other items on their menu"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,My numero uno among over 38 Michelin three stars I had visited all over the world,"So ironic that the best Italian restaurant in the world IMHO is not in Italy, but found in Hong Kong, an overseas outpost for Chef Umberto Bombano. The ambiance is relaxed yet elegant, the service flawless and the food celestial. If you can only come once a year, by all means come in the Winter, to indulge on the white truffles that Umberto’s secret purveyor delivers. Three years in a row, I had the white truffles dinner at Otto, within a month of visiting Alba and dined at the only three stars there, Piazza Duomo Alba, and the truffles at Otto was better every time. Life is not fair."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,The best 3-star in my opinion,"It has been six years since my last visit to this Michelin 3-star restaurant in Alexandra House. Throughout the years, Chef Umberto Bombana has continued to expand his empire with restaurants of the same name in Macau and Shanghai, and also newer ventures like Tuber in K11 MUSEA. Returning tonight, we want to go back to the pinnacle of his empire and hopefully see the chef himself in action.    We are seated at the window side looking out to Chater Road, and the restaurant has the familiar look and feel that remind us of the good times in the prior visit. The soft lighting, comfortable and spacious seating, and the appropriate distance between tables all create a wonderful dining ambience, a luxurious yet relaxing vibe which already win customers over before any food or drink is served.    Starting with an aperitif, I order a glass of Champagne, Claude Cazals Cuvee Vive Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru ($300). With delicate nose, toasty aromas of honey and apricot, the wine is great on purity and freshness. A classic crisp Blanc de Blancs.    Decided to go for the Degustation Menu ($2,380), I also opt for wine pairing ($1,080). Coming first is the amuse bouche Marinated Ama-Ebi, with the Japan spot prawns having nice, sweet taste, serving with some finely diced Beetroot and Orange Emulsion to give a bit of citrusy with refreshing palate. Together with some Bitter Leaf Vegetables, a wonderful starter to stimulate our appetite.    To pair with the first course, the wine served is Faccoli Extra Brut Franciacorta NV, a sparkling from the famous DOCG in Lombardy. Made using traditional method, the wine has 70% Chardonnay, 15% Pinot Bianco, 15% Pinot Nero. Good acidity with a dry mouthfeel, it has nice citrus and mineral characters.    The first course is Tuna Tartare. The tuna belly has been cut into small dices and marinated with yuzu citrus dressing, to balance the fatty tuna with nice acidity. With an abundance of Oscietra Caviar on top to supplement savoury flavours to the tuna, the chef also prepares a Basil Emulsion on the side, rich with nice herbal note to give an extra ‘Italian’ dimension to the dish. Another good dish.    The wine paired with the second course is Florami Indole 2019. Made from 100% indigenous, ungrafted Falanghina, this wine from Campania has an intense nose of yellow flowers, grapefruit, and herbs, with also some saline characters. A nice and interesting wine that I would like to explore more.    The second course is Roasted Blue Lobster. The meaty Brittany lobster tail is cooked perfectly, with a crunchy texture and beautiful umami taste. The chef has paired with some tender Tasmania White Asparagus, serving with a highly flavourful Lobster Sauce, with the concentrated lobster essence so tasty I almost want to lick the plate. A must-try in my opinion.    The next wine is Abrigo Giovanni Barolo Ravera 2015. The wine has a wonderful aroma, with lots of pleasant red fruit, with good earthy characters and robust tannin that are a perfect match with mushrooms in the upcoming course. The sommelier also reminds me to save some for the white truffle risotto later.    The third course is Tagliatelle. The homemade pasta has a fantastic texture, served with Mushrooms Ragout and Fresh Matsutake Mushrooms. After mixing together, the aromas of matsutake permeate to the tagliatelle, with the ragout further enriching the flavours to an extra level. It is pure joy eating this dish and I would rate this pasta as one of the best in town. Another must-order.    Now being white truffle season, and with Chef Bombana hailed as ‘King of White Truffles’, we have ordered the Alba White Truffle Risotto ($1,190) to share. Seeing the chef himself coming over to shave is like watching a star performance. Even at a distance we can smell the wonderful aromas of the white truffle, and despite we share just one order, he has shaved a generous amount for each of us. Having checked with us beforehand, the risotto has been cooked to our preference, slightly softer than the traditional style. With Mushroom Jus and the white truffles mixed together, this is a dish that will be on the list of ‘last dish I want to eat before I die’.    The wine paired with my main course is Podere Sanlorenzo Brunello di Montalcino Bramante 2014. Coming from a small producer in the region, with only 2600 bottles produced annually, the wine has good red cherries, dried figs, cedar, and earthy notes, rounded and robust, with its liquorice characters going well with the lamb.    For the main course, there are two choices. My wife opts for Short Rib & Beef Tenderloin, with Whipped Potato, Red Wine and Plum Sauce, while I go for Baby Lamb from Aveyron. Very beautifully presented, the lamb is served in two cuts, with the rack and loin, cooked to perfect medium rare, nicely seasoned and paired with a delicious lamb jus. On the side are some Brussels Sprouts and Greens, Black Olives and Caponata, providing the great complement in texture and flavours to the lamb. A great dish.    After cleaning up, the staff pulls a cart in front of our table to prepare the pre-dessert. Mixing the lemon sorbet with a bit of limoncello, grappa and prosecco, he vigorously whisks them together to make a Sgroppino, before dusting some Campania lemon zest on top. With refreshing citrus acidity balancing well with sweetness, and a touch of alcohol, it is a great palate cleanser. However, the most amazing and memorable element is definitely the soft ice-cream texture.    The wine pairing for my dessert is I Capitelli Anselmi 2016. This sweet passito wine is made from Garganega, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, with the grapes left to dry in well-ventilated rooms before fermentation. Having nice and complex aromas with plenty of apricot, honey, and pear notes, it is a perfect match with the citrusy dessert of Amalfi lemon.    There are also two choices for dessert, with my wife going for Hazelnut ‘Millefoglie’, Hazelnut Gelato and Vanilla Sauce, and for me it is Amalfi Lemon, with a base of Amalfi lemon cream, then some Citrus Salad on top, together with Mascarpone Sorbet. Very refreshing and citrusy, the balance between acidity and sweetness is perfect. As the hazelnut dessert is also very good, it is a difficult decision to pick among the two.    Included in the tasting menu is Coffee or Tea, and after a nice cup of Double Espresso we are served the Petits Fours. There are various choices from the cart, and I end up picking Panettone Bread, Chocolate Brownie with Figs, and Salted Caramel Chocolate Truffle. All are great in taste and going well with the coffee, indulging us on the finale of a fantastic and highly satisfactory meal.    Service is very good, with the staff all friendly and attentive. Not only did they explain the courses well, but the sommelier also goes into details showcasing the wines and its unique characters, how it matches with the food. He is also thoughtful, topping up the Barolo so I have sufficient wine to go with the additionally ordered white truffle risotto. The bill on the night is $8,168 and while it is not cheap, in my opinion it is worth the dollar. For the overall dining experience, I would rate this restaurant as the best among the three-stars in town."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,40,21st Celebrated in Style,"We were here for the 21st birthday of my youngest and it was all worth it.    Nutty, evenly seasoned tuna tartare topped with caviar and with some puree on the side was divine. And so was the burrata cheese ravioli. The pasta has just the right thickness and cooked perfectly. Was not much of a fan of the tagliatelle with mushroom and the kinki fish. The bone in ribeye was right on.    It's good to have experienced eating at this fine dining restaurant but it's not something that I would look forward to going back to again. The ambiance and the service was great but I feel I did not really get the most of what we spent."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Outstanding!,Had the most amazing dining experience for our first visit to 8 1/2. The food and service were absolutely faultless. The Italian manager was very welcoming and really looked after us well. The food was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. This restaurant is absolutely deserving of its three Michelin stars.

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,The BEST,"So this is my 2nd visit. Last time I reviewed it as ‘almost perfect’, with minor flaws like musty smell on some server’s clothes. Despite those, we loved it and we decided to go again. And this time it is perfect!    Once again we went for the degustation menu with wine pairing. Every dish, every wine, the environment, and the service, all were perfect! My absolute favorite that day was the lamb. We love every minute we spent there and we have decided to go back on every anniversary and birthdays.    Special thanks to Antonello for taking good care of us that day. Looking forward to our next visit!"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,The king of the Italian’s restaurant,"Went for late dinner with my friend, the music and environment always on point.  We had amuse bouche to start with a glass of champagne.  Follow by an abalone starter and 2 pastas.  The taste was sublime, and the service impeccable from the start to the end.  The general manager and the team pair pair each course with the perfect wine.  Must try the Negroni world class.  Do not leave without having a lemon sgroppino, the preparation and taste are incredible.  Well done, well deserved 🌟🌟🌟  Thank you for the fantastic night"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,20,Shocked if they even had one Michelin star,"I’m shocked this place has 3 Michelin stars as I don’t think they even deserve one.    Service was inattentive. Our table had to ask the waiters to top up our water (from bottles kept away from table) on multiple occasions. They were not proactive so empty glasses on the table were commonplace.    Spacing between courses was completely mismanaged. This was probably a kitchen service issue. It got so bad waiting for our main courses that they eventually served us a two-mouth portion pasta filler while we waited. The degustation dinner menu took 3.5 hours to get through, not ideal for a Monday night.    Finally, the food was definitely not worth the wait, not even their signature dishes (angel hair pasta & truffles). The best parts of the meal were the bread basket (so good we asked for refills) and the off-menu pasta filler we were served as a distraction.    No doubt the worst Michelin star experience I've ever had."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Relaxing and amazing Fine Dine lunch experience,"In the usual time , we used to think about Fine dining mostly or only at evening time.  During this unusual time with the rule which restaurant only allowed to ope until 6pm.  I found that Fine dining in the afternoon under the bright sunlight , actually it is totally another different experience.    I had this lovely lunch experience at 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana for my birthday treat.    Walked into Bombana in the afternoon , feeling much more space and relaxing.  We are being seated at this nice big sofa table next to the window with all sunlight we could have and very comfy .    Staffs are super welcoming, and most lovely is being served by the Manager Antonello the whole time, you will enjoy the best experience if he is there for you.    Generally the food is very high quality, presentation is like an art work , and the flavour is very balance and super tasty .  We had about 2 starters , 3 main courses each and the desert with birthday cake .  All the food has wine pairing and each portion is just perfect !  I was really satisfied .    Another good thing is all the dishes that they served my boyfriend and I are totally different , since I love seafood and my bf doesn't eat seafood at all. This way of serves is just fantastic!    My favour dish I will say pretty much everything, but if I do need to suggest, both salon and octopus starters , it is very delicious and the after tasted stayed in the throat is just beautiful.    - Homemade Cavatelli with shellfish ragù and Hokkaido sea urchins , surely one of my favour too, it is flavorful and balance.    It happened that it is the truffle season , so we had this simple but tasty truffle pasta, which I , myself would call it "" truffle rain pasta"" as when the chef put the truffle on the plate just looks like it is raining , and if you look at my pictures, you will see how much truffle it is on the plate as you couldn't even find the pasta .    - UK raw deer with porcini crust, chestnut pure is another one that I am in love with. the thin crispy layer outside , combine the soft , yummy raw deer inside, it just amazing .    I enjoyed this birthday fine dining experience a lot, and surely I would love to experience more lunch Fine dining since then."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Amazing,"Had a fantastic meal with Chef Giuseppe. The beef dish and Dover sole was out of this world. Especially the sauce to the Dover sole. It was an emulsion with a fish stock simmered and reduced over hours, and the acidity was heightened with red wine vinegar.    The truffle pasta was absolutely stunning, one would have thought the shaved truffle was amazing, but really the truffle sauce in the pasta was the real star. Truffly, mushroomy and musky. Completely superb. And don't get me started on the morelle pasta    We will definitely return, superb, best meal in years.    Oh and I forgot to mention the crudo as starters. Wonderful."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,3 stars remarkable dining experience,Definitely one of the best Italian restaurant in Hong Kong. 3 stars are absolutely well deserved. All dishes we tried were remarkable. I came in with high expectation as this restaurant came highly recommended and they actually beyond my expectation in every aspect from food to service. Staffs there are friendly but they can still manage to keep a very high standard professionalism to make you feel very comfortable even dining in a 3 stars restaurant.    It's the white truffle season of course we cannot miss their signature famous truffle pasta by Chef Bombana. I have to say this is the most generous truffle shavings that I have ever seen in my life.    Thank you Chef and the team for giving me and my family such an extraordinary dining experience. Absolutely enjoyable evening and I am missing it already. Can't wait to come back.

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Almost perfect,"Despite its reputation, we never visited it until recently. Now we know why it’s so famous. It’s probably the best restaurant in HK.    We had the degustation menu. Almost all of the dishes were divine. Yes! We meant divine! Not just nice, or delicious, or special, but fresh and unique and exquisite and divine! Harmony of various flavors that became a symphony.    The wine pairing was perfect. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and introduced us to many special and rare wines. The portion was generous as well.    So why ‘almost perfect’?  - I didn’t like the dessert with fig.  - The staff were not entirely finesse. There were several moments when we felt they intruded into our experience, eg started cleaning up the table when you’re still having your last bite of the bread. It was nothing too annoying though and it could be tolerated.  - When I wasn’t happy with my dessert, apparently they didn’t know how to handle it. I put down my fork after a few bites. My husband finished his dessert and left for the bathroom. Staff came, collected his dish, and acted as if they didn’t notice anything wrong. Actually several staff came by, and they all acted the same. Eventually I had to call for one, and tell him I’m not happy with the dessert. They did give me another dessert to try which was much better. (I had the exact experience with Amber the week before. Just by simply showing a bit of dissatisfaction on my face, a staff immediately came to me and checked if things were alright. And they swiftly changed another dessert for me. That was a much better management and I expected that in a Michelin star restaurant.)  - The real bad thing was that, several staff’s clothes had really strong musty smell! It was so strong and bad that every time they passed by, u couldn’t smell the food but only that terrible musty smell! We had to hold our breath for at least a minute! It really disturbed our experience in enjoying such wonderful food. I hope the management will work on this problem.    Overall, still potentially the best restaurant in HK. Should be able to confirm on this after we try Caprice again in Dec. Anyway, wish they could work on the musty smell thing. We surely wanna go back!"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Best restaurant by far in HK,"After visiting twice lately i have only positive things to say about this restaurant. It lives go it’s expectations, and justifies it’s price!    The food is amazing, with great timing and wonderful presentation, and the service attentive, making you feel special every time.    The special touch is the ice cream they mix in front of you, sprinkled with lemons from Amalfi coast.    Definitely will revisit soon!"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Amazing choices of food accompanied by superb ambiance,"Tucked within Alexandra House, Otto has been eluding us in for some time because we could not match our time with their availability.    We finally got one in September (booked a month in advance) and it was a great experience. From the booking confirmation till the time we got seated, the Otto staff was accommodating and communicated very well especially since we had specific dietary restrictions.    We got 2 pasta/risotto dishes, the shortrib + tenderloin from the Mayura Farm and had room for one chocolate dessert.    The dishes were amazing and the best part was that the Otto team would split the dishes for us and serve them similar to a tasting menu was a nice and appreciated gesture.    Highly recommended and worth coming back to as the dishes change depending on available seasonal ingredients."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,40,Tough one,"the service was superb, the food was nothing to write an email to my mother about. Ambiance is fine. A real tough one to review"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Worth it!! Well deserved 3 Michelin Stars!!,Great Italian Restaurant!  Impressive food served with right temperature. Thanks for warm plesant service and recommendation of wine.  Must come again next time and try the signature menu❤️❤️

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Masterpiece,"Never disappoints and feels like want to stay there for overnight. Insanely quality food to the smallest details, service is out of this world, and great to see Grande Antonello in the action! See you soon again!"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,A classic that never cease to amaze,"After 6 years working in the wine industry and 17 years living in Asia I can say that otto e mezzo represent in my opinion everything you should expect when dining in a three Michelin star restaurant.    Food Service Wine pairing…blended together to offer a unique experience that you wish to repeat.    Can't wait to be back and enjoy another great experience, really big thanks to Chef Bombana and the amazing performance of Antonello."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Highly recommended!,Hong Kong’s best Italian fusion restaurant!! Creative cuisine with a real taste of Italy 🇮🇹  You have to have the ice cream dessert called Sgroppino! To die for!

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,40,Underwhelming,"Otto e Mezzo has been the reputational standard-bearer for Italian cuisine in Hong Kong long before I arrived, thanks to its long-time three Michelin star status.    Needless to say, we arrived expecting to be mesmerized. Whilst the overall experience was very good, it certainly did not reach the heady heights hoped for.    After a pleasant potato foam and mushroom amuse-bouche, a tuna tartare was topped with a few dots of caviar but was unfortunately really too small to properly appreciate.  Next was a very well-made ravioli, which came under a creamy tomato sauce. A beautifully-cooked duo of Mayura beef was served with good puree potato, an example of exceptional produce, beautifully cooked and served with a sauce that cries out for more. A hazelnut millefoglie and a grand cru chocolate were exemplary, while the cheese board was generous.  The wine accompaniments were all superb quality alongside the post-dinner Negroni.    Service surprisingly lacked some finesse, given the restaurant’s reputation summarising an overall feel of something missing: An atmosphere which erred too close to that of a business meeting hotspot for execs, staff which were perfectly ample, yet lacked a personal touch and food, which was enjoyable, but not special.  A Michelin star restaurant, it certainly is, but not three."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Top class Italian food,"We had an amazing lunch here, the quality of ingredients is, as expected, the best you can find the level of balance on flavour is world class. We had the tasting menu and was delicious, staff was attentive and helpful at all times. The Italian manager who was very friendly and made us feel at home with his charming personality. The ambience is very elegant and comfortable without a doubt one of the best places to have a meal in Hong Kong"

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,Surprise,This was an amazing surprise - I am not sure if I have ever been to an Italian restaurant (and I have been to a lot) where they just added the litle touch. Everything of course one would think of for a Michelin Star restaurant - but the little things are big in such a restaurant when they even go that extra mile for a first time diner. PERFECTO - just looking forward to then next time there.

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,10,Shockingly unprofessional service and mediocre food,"I recently dined at Otto e Mezzo, a purportedly 3 star restaurant. It was a week later that I read in the news that a chef had tested positive for COVID 19 with several staff members following suit. Yet, I received no correspondence from the restaurant itself to inform me of this development. I contacted them to inquire whether I may have been in contact with any of the staff that tested positive but received NO reply. It was only after the government announced mandatory testing for those that had recently visited the restaurant that they reached out. To top things off, their way of reaching out was by tossing me a PDF file via text message informing me of the mandatory testing THREE DAYS AFTER the government’s announcement.    How can such an irresponsible and unprofessional restaurant possibly deserve 3 stars from Michelin? Should a pricey menu and spraying white Alba truffles on mediocre food mean 3 stars despite the incredibly poor service? White truffles may be delicious but that would be the case in my own kitchen as well. Take away the truffles and I would rather eat at any of the tens of restaurants that serve pasta at a third of the price.    Though we may be living under extraordinary circumstances, restaurants who are dedicated to their customers and truly are worthy of 3 stars from Michelin would surely never handle a situation like this in this manner."

8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana,50,White truffle dinner,"8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana is one of the best restaurants in Hong Kong to go for white truffle.    We’d another great dinner there last night. All my friends took the degustation menu. Since I didn’t want to eat too much, I ordered a la carte.    The homemade tagliolini with white truffle was divine and was worth the hefty HK$990 price tag. The duck main course was also very delicious. The duck was from Challans in France and was cooked to perfection. The meat was rose and tender while the skin crispy. When I’ve dinner at 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana, I usually choose the short rib & beef tenderloin as my main course. So I was glad to have tried the duck for a change. The chocolate dessert blonde cannelloni was so good that I almost ordered another one.    The restaurant is pricey and very hard to book. But it’s worth the extra dollars and the hassle."

The Eight,50,Nice food and great service,We couldn't make a reservation so decided to try walk in.  Was given a table but had only an hr for the meal.  Ordered the meat platter which was yummy.  The vegetable dish was fresh.  Dishes were nice and not salty.  The fried egg White with red bean and coconut ice cream was so yummy

The Eight,50,5 stars on the overall experience,"This one has been on my list since 2019. Once the boarder reopened after covid, I successfully booked with them. Granted it was a 3-month advanced booking, but it was for the peak Easter holiday; so it was alright.    I must admit, the food itself wasn’t as impressive or spectacular as I’d expected for a Michelin 3-star restaurant. I was more wowed with the food other restaurants I visited before. They were art-like, sophisticated and required a lot of work, which I really admire; but they were more on a good level than great or oh-my-god level. We particularly enjoyed the Steamed Garoupa Fillet with Shark’s Fin and Crabmeat in Superior (lobster) Soup.    But the whole experience from the moment you arrived at the reception was seamless and perfect.    Every detail of the decorations were utterly well-thought-out, the chain-like 8 symbols at the hallway to the reception, the projected animated goldfishes swimming across the corridor as the diners walk in, the different statues on every table etc.. The restaurant was extremely clean and comfortable.    And what we were most impressed with, was the service, it was the most courteous and on-point services we have ever received. Everyone was attentive but never to the point that make you feel uneasy. They made you feel like they are all genuinely welcoming and happy to be a part of your dining experience. They were just pleasant and filled you with warmth. Visited a lot of places with great ambiance before and The 8 took it to a whole different level. Just the service itself deserved the three Michelin stars in my opinion.    And in all fairness, the value for money is great. All the “popular”/ “highly recommended”/ always fully booked local restaurants we have visited in our Macau trip weren’t that great in any aspect but similarly pricey; I’d much prefer to spend with The 8 and enjoy the experience."

The Eight,30,Not that great afterall,"It was a rush experience. Lunch has 2 time slots. We came at the earlier slot. When u have all the guests arriving at the same time, host is running to seat the guests as fast as possible and service want to end the meal as soon as possible to get ready for next time slot. Food was normal, not surprising or fantastic. 炸子雞 and the seafood pot taste bland. Chicken with lime n salt to add on the flavor, else it is bland. Seafood pot broth does not have the 鮮味。dim sum was delicately made however not flexible to order lesser pieces instead of default amount."

The Eight,20,Bad service,The food is nice but the service of the operator taking the reservation is horrible! Rude and bad attitude. Like you have to beg her for a table! What's the use of having Michelin chef but rubbish service operators -- Michelin restaurants are starred not only for food but also service quality!

The Eight,50,Michelin three star dining at Grand Lisboa,"The Eight is a famous Chinese restaurant at Grand Lisboa on the Macau Peninsula. This restaurant has achieved a Michelin three star rating for many years now, offering an excellent surprisingly good value of money, fine dining experience.    Service is impeccable, timely and professional, the dining area layout is elegant and food served up is beautifully and creatively presented. Needless to say, the quality of the meal served is very high.    Reservations are highly recommended for those interested in dining at The Eight. Dress code is business casual. Dining area are 11am to 2.30pm (lunch) and 6.30 to 10.30pm (dinner) each day. They are closed on Wednesdays."

The Eight,40,High end well presented Dim Sum,I had lunch at the Eight on lunar new year's eve. Reservation was needed although the restaurant did not seem packed. Each dim sum dish was very well presented. The service was good as it was a high end restaurant.

The Eight,50,Delicious Fine Dining Dim Sum,"During our short time in Macau, we wanted to have high end dim sum and looked into The Eight. While disembarking from our high speed ferry from Hong Kong, we gave them a call. They said their reservations for the day were all gone but that they did accept walk-ins. We headed right to the Grand Lisboa, where the restaurant was located, and were told that it would be an hour wait, but they could accommodate us. We spent our time wandering the close by and got back at the appropriate time. The design of the space is quite calm and luxurious, as compared to the Grand Lisboa hotel and casino downstairs. From the metallic interconnecting ""8"" to the beautifully embroidered goldfish panels behind glass in the dining room. All servers and staff were elegantly attired, attentive to our slightest needs. My boyfriend, my sister, and I all chose dishes from the dim sum menu. In total, we chose about 11 dishes but that comes out more like 13 dishes as we were welcomed with an amuse bouche and finished with a complimentary dessert and cookies to take home. If you do decide to do dim sum here, BUDGET YOUR TIME as each dish is made to order and served individually. This was certainly a new experience for me and I thought it was worth the time and the expense. Dumplings came out in the form of goldfish with edible gold leaf, and other various whimsical shapes. And each dish was seasoned perfectly. Service was attentive with all our dishes announced as they were served and our cups constantly replenished with hot beverages. Having earned their 3 Michelin stars, they deserve every single one of them for this elegant and delicious meal."

The Eight,50,High end restaurant and romantic environment,"Been here for birthday celebration with my girlfriend. The food is super good, the price is quite high so I expect they will have a bigger portion. We love the environment very much and it is romantics and quiet. All staffs are nice and full of smile.  One thing to highlight is, you must well prepare and book earlier, otherwise they will be full booking but it is definitely worth to go."

The Eight,50,Lived up to the hype!,"Went there for dim sum on a Sunday. Must make reservation as they are really popular. Service was excellent, staff were very attentive. The dishes we had were generally delicious - very intricately made as well.  Our favourite were the goldfish har gao, the deep-fried gourd shaped mochi dumplings with pork and the siew Mai. The crab tartlets were ok - very cute though.  Do order their plate of xo sauce to go with the dishes too! It's very flavorful - I regretted not getting a bottle back. For two of us, we spent around S$200 for that lunch."

The Eight,40,Creative Dishes,We visited The Eight restaurant for lunch and everything was not only delicious but also very creative. We definitely experienced an appetite boost. The staff were pleasant and helpful.    There is a dress code-men cannot wear shorts and no flip flops. It appears that they do have pant rental available at the front sure-not sure if the service is free.  We will visit again!

The Eight,50,heavenly taste,i never expected that i will enjoy eating here..the food is heavenly delicous..and its afordable...i will come here again next time

The Eight,40,A 3 start Michelin restaurant but need improve on service,"The restaurant is a Michelin 3 star restaurant. They have din sum , and all different style of Guangdong. The decoration of the restaurant was amazing. It use gold fish as main design. The food taste nice. They mark start on their menu which is a must try. We try to order all their suggest which is good. Only complain was the red bean ice cream cake. It is too sweet. The service is a little slow."

The Eight,50,Superb visit,"Lunch was the highlight of our day trip to Macau, every piece of dim sum and every dish was beautifully crafted and presented to us. Service was wonderful and attentive (they changed our plates often, topped up our tea/water), pleasant spacious surroundings and not at all crowded. Can’t wait to return!"

The Eight,50,Never Fails To Excite!,"This is our second visit to The 8 restaurant and we had to come back because it was so good the first time.  It didn't let us down this time either. When we had previously visited it was for lunch and Dim Sum, but it was a proper grown up meal for dinner. It certainly isn't a place for children and you have to make sure that you are appropriately dressed.  We tried numerous things on the menu which we normally wouldn't have which included Goose Liver and Turtle but none of it disappointed. The food was amazing. The wine was amazing - one thing that we thought odd though was that we picked our initial bottle of wine and there was going to be a ten to fifteen minute wait to get the wine from obviously where they store it. We decided against that and chose one that they had in-house.  Majority of wines are by the bottle, not by the glass so be aware of that. Wasn't a problem for us, but may be for other travellers.  Would we go again regardless that it costs a small fortune for the meal - Absolutely! Worth every cent."

The Eight,50,Eight Good Reasons to Visit!,Absolutely the    1. FINEST and  2. MOST CREATIVE Chinese food in Macau...  3. IMPECCABLE SERVICE  4. Attention to every detail  5. Remarkable Bathrooms - Touch-free doors & so many other surprises in the men's room!  6. Stunning interior design that just never gets old - It's Timeless!  7. Perfect for any special occasion to celebrate OR  8. For business conversations if you want to really impress!

The Eight,40,A Must Visit Restaurant,Thoroughly enjoyed our Dim Sum lunch of good quality and picture-worthy dim sums. Service rendered by Vivi was par excellence.

The Eight,50,Love it,"Goldfish theme at the restaurant simple and elegant. Dim Sum was very pretty and fancy. Thanks to the chef’s amazing artistry. Excellent service by the staff. Overall, it was a lovely experience for my partner and I. Highly recommend this place."

The Eight,50,My second visit to The Eight,"This is my second visit to this restaurant since 2012, before they earned 3 Michelin Stars. Even time flies, I still remember the good dishes when I visited in 2012. So I decide to taste those I tried it before. I am still satisfied about their food and service. Before I leave, the hostess recommends me to try their dim-sum at lunch time. So I will come for it again!"

The Eight,10,Rushed because they need to flip tables for profit.. Poor Service,"Made the reservation 1 month in advance. Wasn't too hard to secure the reservation, but they have a bunch of policies which made things annoying. My seating was 11:30am for 3 people. We sat down and ordered the set menu for 3 people, which was 3000MOP total. Service was extremely lacking as tea was never refilled on time and never hot. Supposedly they should have someone that keeps refilling and making sure tea is properly refilled when it's included in a set menu.    Food was nothing spectacular or amazing for a 3 star restaurant. In fact, some of the dishes were overly seasoned and tasted very heavy. They also lacked the basic culinary skills of making a perfect ChaSiu, which you can find in small food stalls all over Hong Kong. Any small hawker restaurant in Hong Kong can serve up some bomb ChaSiu over noodles. This place served heavy veined pork, which was tough and hard to eat. Responded our opinion about this dish as none of us finished. Manager was notified but he never came over to check on us. They didn't care for customers complaint.    They also rushed the last 3 dishes because they needed to flip the table. Last 3 items were all served at once and we could only eat one at a time. The other dishes were room temp by the time we got to it. Definitely spoiled the quality and taste.    Not sure why these Michelin Inspectors gave them 3 stars. Maybe they don't know anything about Cantonese cuisine. Wouldn't recommend."

The Eight,50,Keep up the Michelin 3*,"So glad I keep coming back here and not once I was disappointed. It is a tad pricier than the other casino/ hotel Chinese restaurant but hey, you’re in Las Vegas of the east - spoil yourself, you only live once. To be fair, it won’t break your bank unless you order loads of wine and Chinese delicacies like shark fins, abolone and other seafoods. If your on a “I’m ready to treat myself some good food” budget, go for the dim sums or even one/ two signature dishes e.g. sweet and sour pork (nothing like the rubbish take out food), roast piglet with glutinous rice stuffing, sizzling vege pot...for dim sum - go for crispy bbq pork bun, beef + squid balls. They give you a free mini appeitzer (changes regularly) and a set of mini dessert (egg tart with milk tea). Be sure to reserve before you go, they have a sufficient online booking system. Most times I went, they were half empty because it was either a weekday or at odd hours but I have been turned away once because they were fully booked."

The Eight,40,not much surprises given it's a 3-star,"the overall dining experience was smooth and nice, not much surprises and excitement given it's a 3-star restaurant.    the dining environment was grand but not having a comfortable feeling. the abundance use of marble made the background a bit noisy to be honest.    food quality was good, but not surprisingly good.  we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing, the wines selected were a bit disappointed given 3 out of 4 wines were white wine, and the red wine was not ready to drink, too much hard tannin. we understand we can't complaint much given it's just an additional $1,000 for 2-pax wine pairing. yet when it comes to visiting a 3-star, budget shouldn't be an utmost consideration. I would suggest they offer an option of wine-pairing for selection.    lastly, the offer of eff tart and Hong Kong style milk tea was a joke to us. The restaurant was serving chinese cuisine instead of Hong Kong's!    We heard their lunch time dim sum was good, possibly a wrong choice on visiting for dinner."

The Eight,50,3 Michelin star,To be honest not sure if this restaurant is what I was expecting or used to when I heard 3 Michelin stars. However as a Chinese restaurant the food was very good. Slightly on the expensive side but I guess that’s what the Michelin is for. It’s vegetarian friendly. One of their signature dishes is the the black truffle fried rice. Highly recommend this restaurant.

The Eight,10,Avoid coming here if you have small children in your party,"This review is mainly for the poor service and how inflexible this so called fine dining restaurant handled reservations.    Do not come here if your child needs to sit on a high chair. They have sofa tables but apparently those are for 6 guests only(we are a party of 6adults and 1 baby 1.8yo) we mentioned that we wouldn’t mind to sit a little closer to each other but the staff insisted that would be against their policy!! And other guests see that might complain or something!? I seriously didn’t understand what she was saying but if the restaurant is not children friendly then why don’t you just tell us children are not welcome????!!!    They suggested that they will TRY to look for a high chair somewhere from the hotel but they do not guarantee if they can get one! If this is how again a ‘fine dining restaurant’ referred by that staff, sorry the service is not really fine dining standard!!! So we ended up cancelling the reservation and went somewhere else instead!"

The Eight,40,Dinner for four adults and one nine year old child,"We ordered a few appetizers. The chilled shredded chicken with bean sheet pasta and sesame oil ( 手撕雞）was very good, particularly the pasta. But the crisp frog leg was better in form than the taste, as frog leg itself was not so tasty.  Among the main dishes we ordered, the roasted pork roll with asparagus and green apple was surprisingly fresh , while the signature dish suckling pig with fried rice lived up to expection and also filling. The beef loaf on the other hand was not finely cooked enough.  The vegetable with lily bulb and birth seeds was most refreshing.  The service and settings were excellent.  Overall the price for our reasonable dishes was also reasonable. So this restaurant is recommended."

The Eight,50,Excellent food and service,"This is my third time to have lunch here. The flavor of food are still amazing. The service is still perfect. The price is also reasonable. This time, except ordering Dim Sum, we also ordered 手撕雞、烤鵝 and fried vegetable, it tasted great! I told myself, I will try other dishes next time!"

The Eight,50,"Go, just go!","As mouthwatering the pictures of the dishes are on the internet, they were as good and giggle-worthy in real life.    We went on a Friday night. The place was not overly crowded. We were still able to carry on a private conversation in our group. We had reservations but had to change the time and they were so accommodating.    Service was excellent at this resto. Normally, Chinese servers and wait staff in Macau and Hong Kong are not the friendliest (this is the consensus among our travel group), but not at The Eight. Everyone was so nice at this place and served us with a smile and did not appear to be in any rush.    Food was ah-ma-zing! I still dream about the dishes we had there. If you want elevated ultra fine dining Chinese food, this is the place. So go ahead and splurge!"

The Eight,50,Dim Sum Lunch,"If you prefer to try how the chef enhance the look and taste of traditional Chinese dim sum, the Eighth is a good place to go, where you can enjoy nice service, decor and food. There is a dress code, and always fully book, so reservation is advisable. Budget US$50-60 per person for dim sum lunch should be good enough, below that is also OK if you just wanted to try a little bit."

The Eight,50,Excellent dim sum,"We had an excellent dim sum lunch here that was enjoyed by three generations. Contrasting this to higher end dim sum in HK: (1) the decor and service is Michelin quality (in English, Cantonese and Mandarin); (2) the food is similarly of a very high standard; and (3) it is significantly better value than similar establishments in HK."

The Eight,50,Delightful birthday dinner,"Heard lots of wonderful things about this 3 Michelin Star restaurant so we went ahead and tried it. We ordered a full course set and since it was my birthday, my husband ordered their signature Baked Alaska cake. We were initially worried that the experience would be underwhelming since we had lunch that day at another famous Michelin star Chinese restaurant (and loved it). Anyway,the moment,we reached the Eight,we were impressed by the entrance. Automatic sliding doors, cascading water...that really set the mood. Our server explained the dishes,their origins,the ingredients,etc. It's small things like these that really make the dining experience complete. But at the end of the day,it all comes down to taste. And at the Eight,we enjoyed almost every single dish that was served to us. The silver needle jasmine tea that came with the set was so good (and helped calm our tummies coz we were already super full waaay before we reached dessert). That said,their portions are just perfect. We couldn't finish my ice cream cake but we each had a slice and it was amazing (perfect coz I'm a fan of red bean). Finally, we were gifted with complimentary egg tarts and milk tea-- as if to say ""Welcome to Macau"". Lovely dinner."

The Eight,40,one of the best in town,This is a nice Chinese restaurant and one of the best in town.The restaurant offered similar front door reception and settings like the ones in the central Hong Kong. I had several chinese dim sum dishes which were done perfectly without much greasy nature. The ambience was very nice but I found out the servers were not as observant and attentive as the ones in Lai Heen of Ritz. My personal opinion is that Lai Heen edges out much better with overall package.

The Eight,50,Superb,"Visited Macau, couldn’t get reservations to Robuchon Au Dome, but I was able to get dinner for two at The Eight on a Saturday night!    From the moment you walk in your are greeted with excellent service staff and a grandeur interior. Many many choices but we opted for the “Signature Dishes Set Menu,” and were not disappointed.    Everything as far as service was superb. The food was also excellent. The portions appear small, but by the time the wanton soup came we were stuffed.    Highly recommended and would go back! Worthy of the Three Michelin Star rating."

The Eight,50,Large variety of Dim sum,"The eight restaurant at Lisboa hotel is around 100 years old and provides a large variety of Cantonese cuisine , there is more than 40 types of Dim sum . More than 10000 variety of wines . Great"

The Eight,50,"Not just dim sum, it is a very good Chinese restaurant.","It is a very lovely Chinese restaurant, deco is elegant, quiet with quality food. It is not a cheap restaurant, but they have excellent food. Put a lot of thought into their dim sum. Their other dishes are all excellent too."

The Eight,50,Memorable Dim Sum Lunch in Macau,"I am normally not a big fan of dim sum but The Eight is exceptional. We chose dishes which were superbly hand-crafted as well as delicious --- char siu buns shaped as hedgehogs, shrimp dumplings in the shape of gold fish, lobster dumplings wrapped in jade colour delicate skin, pastry with shrimp and pork filling in the shape of a suitcase and many more fantastic offerings. The service was attentive and excellent but not intrusive. The waitress sees that your tea is close to finish and fills your cup with piping hot tea (nothing is worse than lukewarm tea). The dessert gelatin comes in the shape of gold fish --- a white one for coconut flavour and a yellow one for mango accompanied by a fruit sorbet. The presentation for each dish is elegant and artistic. Reservation is a must if you don't want to be disappointed. There is an amuse bouche before the dim sum you order arrive and also mini complimentary Macau egg tarts to end your meal."

The Eight,50,Fabulous,"We went here for the last evening of our China trip and it was well worth it.Set in a beautiful room away from the chaos and noise outside in the hotel. We had the tasting menu with paired wines and it was all exceptional. The quality of the food was excellent and the wine pairings were an opportunity to try some outstanding wines.  The service was very attentive and a special mention must go to Nick Koon ,the sommelier, for his helpful and friendly attitude and particularly for his choice of wines."

The Eight,50,Just Loved it.....,"The food, the service, the presentation, the ambiance, not sure what more i can say, but absolutely amazing."

The Eight,50,Best Dim Sum,My family and I were visiting Macau again and I had wanted to try this place for a long time. Finally remembered to make a reservation in advance (this is recommended via their website). They're very accommodating when it comes to the number of dumplings you need for your group. There were four of us and they were able to add an extra dumpling to the dishes that normally come in an order of 3. We were pretty impressed by the presentation as well as the quality of the food. The price was very reasonable for a 3 star Michelin. It's pricer than the majority of the dim sum restaurants you're used to but the quality is also much higher. For the four of us we paid $2088 MOP and we were stuffed. Highly recommended. Will go back again!

The Eight,20,"Good Food, Poor Service","The food is good and should come to enjoy it, however the service quality is very disappointing. No service sense at all and just act like a robot with procedure. Definitely not a 3 stars restaurant."

The Eight,50,Extraordinary,"I was invited to dinner at 8 of the Grand Lisboa yesterday. This is a 3-Star Michelin restaurant, located on the second floor. Their dishes are very special and unique. We had mini abalone and Braised Sliced Yunnan Ham topped with Mashed Potatoes and Chrysanthemums as appetizers. The soup was Chicken Broth with Fish Delicate and Bean Curd in Chrysanthemum Shape. Then for the main courses, they were 1. Deep-fried Cristal Blue Shrimp Mousse filled with Goose Liver Pate, 2. Pan-fried Sliced A5 Kagoshima Beef Rolled with Watercress, 3. Deep-fried Chicken in “Pei Pa” Style with Cristal Blue Shrimp Mousse, 4. Australian lobster, 5. Suckling Pig filled with Fried Rice and Preserved Meat, 6. Seafood pot, 7. Snow Pea Leaves Stir Fried with Garlic. We tried three different desserts - sesame pudding, pomelo Cointreau and Deep-fried Egg White Ball with Red Bean Filling served with Coconut Ice-cream. They were all delicious. Averagely, it was $700 per person."

The Eight,50,Wow,"I booked my New Years Eve dinner here and was I glad that I did! First, don’t overdress...just look spiffy and clean and you will fit right in. Second, put yourself in the waiter’s hands. He recommended a delicious mix of dishes that I adored. Third, prepare to be impressed....the food is more than good. Each plate is a work of art. This is why The Eight is one of the top 20 Chinese restaurants in the world."

The Eight,30,Definitely Not a Three Star Restaurant,"Super disappointing experience. I had read rave reviews about this restaurant. I wouldn’t give the food and service a single star. I think I’ve had better meals at PF Chang’s. The food wasn’t bad; it just wasn’t what I expected. However, the plating/presentation and concept of the dishes was at Michelin Star level; though definitely not three."

The Eight,40,Very good but not 3 Star Michelin,"We dined at the Grand Lisboa’s two 3 Star Michelin Restaurants on consecutive days. Already reviewed Robouchon yesterday which was just amazing. Today’s dining experience at the Cantonese 3 Star Restaurant ‘The 8’ - was also highly pleasurable but on a like for like basis Robouchon wins hands down. The service was extremely attentive but no matter what it cannot shake off the typical family style, whenever its ready in the kitchen service sequence. Family style servings can never match the intricate plated service presentation of a top notch western restaurant.  The 8 Signature dim sum is enjoyable but some seems more for the cute factor (Goldfish shaped) than taste. Granted the meal for 4 was only half of that compared to Robouchon but still no contest."

The Eight,30,Expectation not met ...,"We were very much looking forward to a very special dinner at the Eight, which is one of the 3-Micheline star restaurants in Macau.    The design of the restaurant is beautiful, linking to the number 8 and Chinese gold fish - both lucky symbols.    We order the signature course and this came highly recommended.    The 8 dishes were were quite good, but did not meet my expectations for a 3-star restaurant. nothing was rally exceptional, the wagyu beef course was not well matched with the sides and the mango dessert was a real disappointment - which we refused to eat. The signature dim sum very, which are special design of the Eight were not on the menu.    Service was attentive, but little busy. Worth to mention is the really outstanding wine list with some 16 thousand different labels, esp. from Burgundy, Bordeaux and Germany.    All in all a pleasant dinner, but far from our expectations."

The Eight,50,Recommendation by Sommelier Nick Koon - exquisite culinary craftsman - Michelin 3-Stars Restaurant,"Appalled by the fine culinary craftsman of the Dim Sum recommendation by Nick Koon... when we were seated, Nick is so attentive and detailed in his recommendation and we took his word for it... what amazes us is that he is not the Restaurant Manager, which is normally the case. As a wine sommelier, he is definitely well versed in the menu selection and his recommendation blew us away...    As for the presentation and taste, we must say, this is truly a Michelin Star restaurant worth dining for, make us happy just by looking at it...... we went there for lunch and it seems value for money too...."

The Eight,50,GREAT,"You better do reservation before going. 95% time are full. Food is great, service veru good, price not expensive!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Very disappointing -not worth it anymore,"Pity as it used to be a regular for us coming to Paris for many years since it opened. Food was mostly bland, & for what it was it was overpriced. When we queried a dish our waiter didn't want to acknowledge it & was even more rude than before.    There are much places to go in Paris."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Worth the price for a special occasion,Before his premature death Joel Robuchon created this formula for his restaurants that rightly thrive around the world’s global cities. You typically sit at the serving counters - there are separate settings for groups of more than two - where the staff present a very expensive degustation menu or items from an a la carte one. Go for the second if you are confident of what you know and like.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Asked to tip at a Michelin star restaurant,"The food was simply incredible.    After an incredible meal with some cool people, from all around the world, and one great French actor.    As I finish my espresso, and I was getting ready to pay, a Michelin, star employee, female, asked me, if I wanted to give them a tip?    I think, for a Michelin star restaurant employee to asked a patron, if they want to give a tip is the most despicable thing I have ever experienced!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Rude front door staff ruin experience.,"This has been an excellent restaurant for 20 years. The wait staff is very friendly. Unfortunately the front door staff is perpetually atrocious. It’s unfortunate that they carry the rude Parisian wait staff rule and extend it. Vincent is the primary offender. What would otherwise be a delightful dining experience is marred by their dreadful evening managers, and door managers. Shame. Therefore not Michelin quality."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,A must try in Paris,Amazing experience !! From service to quality of food and price point !!! We’ll be back ! Our hostess at the counter was knowledgeable and spoke 3 languages !! He really made a difference when explaining each dish as they were coming !!

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Outstanding!,"Outstanding tasting menu and service, enjoyed atmosphere, which encouraged interaction with Chef's as well as other patrols."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Would skip this one,"Visited with my family for what I expected to be a nice meal in Paris. Ambiance and service are both severely lacking. I am not want to normally write reviews, but save your time and pass on this restaurant. The food is actually decent, but the waiters practically throw the food at you, I get better service at my local diner back home. Skip this one while in Paris."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,10,Terrible receptionist and maneger do not go,We had a reservation for 9PM. We waited for 40 min while whatcing other people been seated and forcing their way into the tables.They kept telling us we had to wait our tabel because we are not frequent customers and they had a preference and could not say no for frequent customers.  Do not spend your time to go

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,"Good Restaurant, But Some Issues","Good restaurant, but our waiter seemed very green and unsure of himself.    We each ordered the formula for that evening, of a starter, main and dessert, and we were charged separately for each item, which we didn't realize until we got back to the hotel and were looking at the total. We intended to go back and ask for an adjustment, but we got busy with sightseeing and didn't go back.    For starters, we both had the cold veggie soup (pea soup, maybe? I don't remember). It was cool, refreshing and delicious. Next, boyfriend had the rotisserie chicken, and I had a white fish with a caramel sauce - which sounds weird, and it is, but it was delicious. We had a side of au gratin potatoes, which have to be the best I've ever had, and a ""complimentary"" side of mashed potatoes - also fantastic! (However, I believe we were charged for those as well).    We split a bottle of a nice white French wine. Dessert was a mousse of some kind, and very delicious!    Despite our waiter and the fact that we believe we were overcharged, we'd still go back. We'll just check the bill more carefully next time."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Great place to celebrate a special occasion,"Beyond having the best mashed potatoes you will ever eat, this is a great restaurant for celebrating a special occasion. Although on the very high end on prices, this restaurant is well worth it if you want to experience an exceptional tasting menu. Service was excellent."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Exquisit - after our fouth visit still!!!,"L'Atelier is quite obviously a place that atracts comentators that hate the place in advance. I have red few recent non favourable reviews. Although I strongly believe in necessary difference of opinion regarding food and chefs and restaurants, it strucks me whenever I read comments from that day I have visited or days around. It is highly unlikely that staff would be highly attentive and proffesional in my case and not in other cases. It is highly unlikely that my food would be designed in accordance with taste and general design pattern of the house but not in another cases.  I have been here already couple of years ago. And if I could compare, I would say that already perfect restaurant improved. I hate conventional Michelin restaurants for being mostly overambitious and poor in creating a taste. L'Atelier did not fall into this trap. In the contrary. Full bodied tastes all around. A touch of contemporary techniques, but just enough. What else to say?  Well: it is not cheap. 200eur p/p is minimum, I guess for an event that one deserves there. I did not regret any cent."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,One star dining at it's best,Incredible dinner for a fantastic price. Service could not have been better. Atmosphere was top notch.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Perfect place to dine solo!,"I was on a trip to Paris alone and I was looking for a place to have a fabulous dinner that wouldn't be awkward. This was the best place I could have chosen! There is seating at a counter/bar all around the kitchen. You get amazing service, incredible food, and a highly interactive experience. The serving staff was great and very friendly. I ordered the tasting menu, and they described each course, and I asked for suggestions for glasses of wine which were terrific. I can't wait to go back the next time I am in Paris!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Renowned Restaurant Delivers Superb Food,"I see the negative reviews below but our experience was marvelous--the hour was early (12:30-ish) and the restaurant pretty empty. We were seated nicely at the lovely central bar, which we very much enjoyed. The chef was contending with some difficult dish--beating it into submission--and the entire show was entertaining. Our lunch was reasonably priced but we had no wine--the wine list was formidable but truly expensive (a Pomerol for 14K euros!)."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Service as bad as the food was good,"The food was excellent. The service was soooo bad. Where do they find staff that bad? New dish arrived before the last one was cleared. Every time. Even after we complained and told them to slow down. The chef must be so embarrassed/angry to see such services. His food was so good.  Wine glasses are stupidly expensive. Lucky the service was so inefficient, should have had a few more glasses."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Nice experience,"Very good food, like always, the quail with foe was the best. Service weird at the beginning but great at the end. Only weird thing the waitress at the end asking us to leave tip at the credit card (u do not do that in France) Good Job and great food."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,a touch of genius,"Enjoyment to your eyes and your mouth! The food looks good as much as it tastes, It is not cheap, but, order a few small dishes and enjoy life!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,10,Most disappointing!,"A letter I sent to the restaurant after the last visit there a few weeks ago, unfortunately no one got back to me  I would like to tell you about the experience we had on September 26 at your restaurant.  The place was booked several weeks in advance, initially I booked just for me, but after I called and checked that one diner could have the tasting menu and the other diner could eat a la carte, I canceled the reservation for a single person and replaced it with a reservation for a couple.  When we arrived at the restaurant, the host at the entrance said there was no reservation in our name. After he checked he said he did see the cancellation but not the reservation for two and the restaurant was full so we couldn't dine that evening. Luckily the mobile phone records all the calls and I played the call to the host. The host still claimed that there was no room in the restaurant and only after we insisted, he suddenly ""remembered"" that there were 2 free places, on the side of the restaurant in front of the window facing the street. It should be noted that at no point did he apologize for the fault in receiving the order.  I ordered the DISCOVERY MENU and my wife ordered 3 courses - 2 starters and a main course.  We received the first dish together and then I continued to receive the dishes without my wife receiving a single dish. After I got the course before the last main course, we asked the waiter what was going on with my wife's second course and he said he would check. Just after I got my main course, my wife's second starter arrived and of course her main course arrived long after I had finished eating my main course.  The sauce in my wife's fish dish was very salty and inedible, my wife left more than half of the dish on the plate. The waiter who cleared the dish did not ask what the reason was, we drew his attention to the fact that the dish was not eaten due to the salty sauce, and he promised that he would pass it on, beyond that we received no reference to it.  Next to us was another couple who started after us and also ate the DISCOVERY MENU. After my wife had already finished eating, the couple got the first dessert and the second dessert while I didn't get dessert. After they finished, the shift manager came and brought them the bill and approached us with a bill in hand (probably ours). We brought to his attention that we hadn't gotten desserts yet and he made a head motion of ""I can't believe what's going on here"" and went to get us desserts.  Additional Comments:  - During the evening, at least in 3 dishes, the dish was served to before they brought me the cutlery for the dish and only after they brought it and saw that I didn't have cutlery they went to get it.  - From the bottle of water that was brought at the beginning of the meal, we poured water into our glasses only at the beginning, during the entire meal none of the waiters bothered to fill our water glasses.  It should be noted that we did not wait for the end of the meal to try to improve the situation and several times during the meal we drew the attention of the waiters and the shift manager to the service we receive, each time we were told that they take it into their attention, but as you can see, each time the situation gets worse.  After the meal, one of the waitresses came over and asked how it was.... We told her again the summary of the events and asked for your details, she took my phone number from us and promised to call...  In conclusion, this was our last evening in Paris. We chose L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon to close a circle, because the best meal on our honeymoon exactly 15 years ago (24/9) was at L'Atelier in Las Vegas and we wanted to repeat the experience, what's more, the night we dined my wife celebrated her birthday  I've had the chance to eat at many dozens of Michelin restaurants over the past few years and I've never encountered such a service experience ((I also went to eat at L'Atelier in Saint Germain a few years ago and had a great experience).  What we experienced was an evening with such terrible service that it ruined our wedding anniversary celebration and my wife's birthday celebration.  I would appreciate your reference."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,30,Artful Cattle-call,"I get it...most starred Michelin chef, every plate is meant to be an art piece. And while the food was tasty and the ""experience"" is what you are really paying for, I wouldn't go back, nor would I recommend it.    It is also the ONLY restaurant we went to in 7 nights that asked for...and EXPECTED you to tip the staff. They did nothing to impress me more than any other place we ate at. Oh well, live and learn."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,30,Rude at the end of service after paying,"We had a great dinner. Between six of us we spent about $1,600 in wine and food. The service was a bit slow and the wines came out slowly. Right after we paid we were told they needed our table, but we weren't finished with our wine. We politely got up and gave up our table. On the way out I spoke to the host and explained that we hadn't finished our wine. She asked what time our booking was and starting counting the hours we had been there and basically blamed us for staying too long. This could have been handled a lot better. It was rude to push us out without finishing our wine and we weren't the reason for the meal taking so long. I would have given them 7 out of 10 stars but it is dropped to 5 out of 10 for the rudeness. They clearly overbooked the restaurant and their slow service is the only reason why we had stayed so long to begin with."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,"""It's a Splurge!""","I've been to the L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon Vegas twice, and once again to the mother ship on our most recent trip to Paris. Since the passing of M. Robuchon, not much has changed -- the food is still very much first class, service is attentive, wine selection is reasonably and broad, and it is very much the machine that what I believe the old guard French chefs relied upon.    So, that was the good. As the title states - it's a splurge, and it's the kind of place you go once or twice because a regular regime of it is probably not how I'd want to spend my time.    Go -- if you've never been. Go -- if you are intrigued by classical French cooking where the texture is soft, and the sauces are what it is all about. Go -- if you want to impress your date. Go -- if you're looking for something that is 100% reliable.    Don't go if you've been, as it hasn't changed much in the years. Don't go if you're looking for more interesting modern French cuisine by a new crop of talented young chefs. Don't go if you're date couldn't care less.    So, yeah, I liked it. It was a lot of money for what it was, and I was not surprised nor disappointed. I've had far worse meals on a value basis than here, and we both walked out happy -- until my wife suffered from an overdose of the meal, which is extremely rich and full of all of the goodness of French cooking, being butter and cream.    Finally, I must say that the world of dining has moved on a bit - the restaurant was full of people of a certain age, mostly out to celebrate on a splurge, and I'd sincerely doubt any of them were Parisians. Frankly, there was more English spoken than any other language, so that was a clear indicator of their clientele."

Jade Dragon,50,Great food with exceptional service,"Lunch with family to celebrate the anniversary. Ordering the set lunch menu, and the food was more than I expected in both quality and quantity. Their bbq pork collar is divine, and everything exceeds my expectations. The manager Thomas goes out of his way to ensure all customers are taking of, and his service, plus the food, makes this restaurant a well-deserved double three stars!"

Jade Dragon,50,A good dinner for a good start of my Macau journey,"It is a user-friendly restaurant that they answered my numerous inquiries, from seating, special needs on cuisine choice, with a friendly hostess to make you relax for the whole meal."

Jade Dragon,30,3 TripAdvisor marks for 3 Michelin Stars,"I was hesitating between choosing the Eight or Jade Dragon to celebrate my birthday.    I have to say the food was great, the service provided by my initial waitress and sommelier clear neat and tidy.    However, when I have booked the table throughout phone call, the receptionist tried to up sell a cake or a peach dessert, I do not eat pastry, therefore I asked if the peach dessert was made of fresh fruit, she said yes. Ends up I have received a dry flavourless peach bum at the end of my meal. Quiet disappointing last note for birthday.    The service was good all the way, but I could feel a weird energy coming from the closing manager/supervisor which is call Gazel, she made me feel like she was showing me the way out quiet early as I was the last customer in the restaurant. 3 Michelin Stars ?    I do believe and understand mistakes happen in this industry when running a busy shift. We have been overcharged a dish, we asked one soup to be served I two bowl, but they charged two portions.    I probably won’t go again,  Overall an average experience"

Jade Dragon,50,1st class service with amazing food,"First class experience all the way. The food, the service and the restaurant design are all amazing. The staff are all very courteous, friendly and well informed on the menu. I have been living in Shanghai/Hong Kong for the past nine years and this is the best Chinese restaurant I have been to during this time. I would love to come here again to also try the dim sum. Definitely worth a visit and as long as you don’t order the special seafood dishes the price is actually quite reasonable for the quality of the food and when compared to other three Michelin starred restaurants.    Food: 4.75 stars  Service: 5 stars  Environment: 4.5 stars  Overall: 4.75 stars  Recommendations: Peking goose, scallion oil with bbq pork belly noodles, almond creme brûlée, egg tarts, suckling pig skin with sesame and shrimp    The Peking goose is a must order and you will need to order this in advance. The goose is prepared two ways: one is the Peking g duck style and the other is the leg meat, which is paired with the goose jus and plum sauce. The is is the best version of the dish I have ever had and I have eaten this dish many many times (including famous places in Beijing).    The other dish I really loved which was also the least expensive was the scallion noodles with bbq pork belly. This a upscale take in a classic Shanghainese dish. The noodles are clearly made in house and have an amazing springy texture to them. They are then basted in scallion oil and pig fat to give a rich luscious taste to the dish. The pork belly is no after thought. These two pieces of bbq pork are smoked with a real depth of flavor to them that is hard to describe without actually eating them."

Jade Dragon,50,"Exquisite, worthy of Michelin 3 Stars","Did not know what to expect from this restaurant as I have not heard or read anything about it. My brother booked this restaurant for us to have lunch and he told me that it has 3 Michelin Stars. Upon entering the restaurant you just felt that it was going to be a great experience because the decor was elegant and the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The lady that catered us recommended many signature dishes, the special Peach Oolong tea & the Chilled Cherry Tomato on Japanese Plum Wine jelly as an appetizer. Every dish was beautiful, tasty and exquisite. It was a great lunch and we wanted to go back for dinner. Sadly they were all booked up that evening and we had to leave the next morning. This is definitely the best restaurant we've had for lunch in Macau and may probably also for dinner should we had the chance to eat there. Great atmosphere, service and staff. Well done! Also noticed that the staff all wore a piece of jade with their uniform (outfit), a nice touch with the restaurant name and with green jade dragon on the table."

Jade Dragon,50,An extraordinary experience,"From the first moment to the last mouthful, an extraordinary gastronomic experience at the very highest level. Impeccable service and a galaxy of flavors and textures, exquisitely executed and delivered with six-star class. Unforgettable."

Jade Dragon,50,Interesting food and nice decor,"Food was amazing as expected. Seating was spacious. Attentive service. Will be back to try their lunch menu as it should be as exciting as the dinner menu. Would recommend booking the table in advance, especially book ahead the peking duck as we didnt get the chance to try this signature dish"

Jade Dragon,50,Dinner,"This is one of my favourite restaurant in Macau.  Start from the kitchen to table set up and the ambient, all are wonderful.  Food were fresh, tasty and delicious and have plenty of good wine selection.  For me this restaurant justify to be given 3 stars Michelin, well done !!!"

Jade Dragon,50,fantastic,what a fantastic restaurant. we went for lunch from hong kong with our two girls (2 and 7 yo) and had to book a private room. beautiful restaurant with all the luxury you can imagine (e.g. en suite private rest room). great staff made all of us being very welcomed. food was outstanding.

Jade Dragon,50,3 Star Michelin Dinner,This is our first visit to Jade Dragon; the ambiance/decor was first class with excellent food. Service was attentive and dishes were clearly explained (such as cooking method). Deep-fried oysters was my favorite dish - crispy batter and cooked to perfection.    Must visit in Macau and fully deserving of its 3-star status.

Jade Dragon,50,The best Chinese restaurant in Macau in my mind,"I have been to Jade Dragon for several times before, but this is my first time after it is rewarded the 3-star Michelin title. Surprisingly, prices are more or less as before and the services are excellent as always. Given that I bought with me a good bottle of burgundy red, I only order simple meat dishes like the famous bbq pork and the newly introduced pigeon. But the staff are very friendly explaining the dishes to us and no push for ordering more expensive dishes. We have a good time and it is highly recommended for anyone who loves to have an excellent Chinese meal under good atmosphere."

Jade Dragon,40,exceptional cantonese cuisine,restaurant setting was nice and relaxing. great ambiance. food quality was outstanding. innovative on menu. service was offered promptly and just right. overall a very enjoyable dining experience.

Jade Dragon,50,My first time to Jade Dragon,"I took a trip to Macau more so specifically Cotai, an island off of Macau. Just across a bridge. Many casino resorts at Cotai include Wynn Palace, Venetian, Studio city, City of Dreams, Parisian and MGM.  Jade Dragon is located in City is Dreams across from Wynn Palace and MGM.  The meal.......Amazing  The service....Top notch  The decor.....not a Wow factor but very elegant  When you dine here, you get the sense of a story. There is a beginning and ending. The food is very detail oriented and it is coupled with impeccable service.  If you get the pleasure, please request the staff of Jameson and Sarah. Multi-lingual, professional, soft spoken and extremely accommodating. Ask them anything about the menu, the restaurant and history, they are more than happy to answer and and all inquiries. The front of house staff is just as elegant and professional.  Anyone dining at a 3 Michelin star restaurant is not going to look at pricing so I won’t get into that.    By far, MUST GO, if you make a trip to the Cotai island.  It’s a true dining experience and worth every penny you spend.  Highly recommended and dress code is not as strict as other fine dining restaurants.  I wore very dark jeans, a dress shirt tucked out and loafers. I was fine.  Please add gratuity to such fine service."

Jade Dragon,50,Great food,"Amazing meal, every course was full of multitude of flavors. Service is also excellent Do come and try what must be best Chinese food in Macau"

Jade Dragon,50,BEST DIM SUM EVER,Truly the best dim sum I have ever experienced. Amazing BBQ pork. An absolute must for any dim sum lover

Jade Dragon,50,The Gem of Macau,"Jade Dragon, on the second floor of the Crown Towers Hotel within the City of Dreams casino complex. As a Michelin restaurant, the service and food were excellent. Especially Kobe beef was so soft that I was surprised. The materials used are exquisite, the cuisine is superb, the environment is luxurious and the service is exquisite. It is worth visiting."

Jade Dragon,50,Exquisite fine dining experience,We had lunch at the Jade Dragon and it was excellent. The service is impeccable and the restaurant is just gorgeous! The food was delicious as well.

Jade Dragon,50,"BIRTHDAY DREAMS CAME TRUE AT JADE DRAGON, CITY OF DREAMS.","Having celebrated my husband’s belated birthday at Jade Dragon on 29 Nov 2018 and also for the past four consecutive years, below are both the good points and the bad points that l find this time.    GOOD POINTS    1. Excellent service. Staff are very attentive and friendly, especially Noel and Grazel, our regular servers, who will always find time to stop for a friendly chat with warm smiles.    2. Great food. Dim sum dishes are all beautifully presented and tasty, especially the Garoupa dumpling.    3. Tranquil environment. Seating arrangement is very good and customers have plenty of space and privacy during dining.    4. Humble Michelin 3 Star Master Chef. Mr. Kelvin Au Yeung is so humble that he shares his working experience here at City of Dreams for the past 10 years. He is willing to ask us for any comments or feedback about his cooking. My husband said to him, “Your food is perfect.”    BAD POINTS    I am pleased to report that there were none.    ADVICE: Definitely a great place to dine and enjoy! No wonder they got highly ranked in the Michelin Awards just recently."

Jade Dragon,50,Michelin 2* exp,"Bring a wife to visit this Restaurant again. Remember to book a table in Advance. Appetizer, soup, lobster glass noodle and black truffle chicken, all delicious, come back again."

Jade Dragon,40,Not so Good,Value for money this is a bad place to be with poor service and decorations compare to other restaurants around the re

Jade Dragon,40,Jade Dragon - one of the best Chinese Restaurant in Macau,"Price is expensive, but food really good. The icy tomatoes as starter was very refreshing. The barbarcued pork meat was juicy and tender (best of the night). The goose skin was cripsy..."

Jade Dragon,40,The ultimate Chinese,"In Macau your options are unlimited.. But when it comes down to Chinese, the Jade Dragon is unbeatable.. A bit rude at the desk.. But once inside you are in a dining heaven.. Although famous for their goose.. Trust me its CRAB CRAB CRAB"

Jade Dragon,40,Don’t book online. Call to reserve tablw,Still very good after a few visits. Although the tea quality or method of serving drop dramatically. The tea is super expensive.  Roasted pork and Roasted pork tart still the best after all •!  Highly recommend the melted custard steam bun!! Be aware the custard is really hot😍

Jade Dragon,50,"Excellent food, Phenomenal dining experience, Superb service","Two michelin stars and number 32 on the Asia Best 50 restaurants.  This restaurant located in the city of Dreams, Macau, is the gem. Their seasonal tea is a must-try. This season (summer 2018) is a combination of green tea, osmanthus, rose etc. A great combination that I can never get enough of.  Thanks to the superb and professional service from the waiters (shout out to Brian) and the others for such a phenomenal dining experience. Their thoughtful and meticulous service really deserve 3 stars.  The crispy suckling pig with caviar was my favourite dish. Crispy and savoury all in one bite filling your mouth with flavours.  The interior and the ambiance were magnificent.  I really enjoyed my meal here and would definitely want to come back for more, especially for their signature lychee wood-smoked dishes."

Jade Dragon,50,Best Chinese,"Good service, dishes that are well cooked and have depth of multiple flavours. Really 3njoyed the different dishes. Will look to go back"

Jade Dragon,50,Superb Dining Experience,"When it comes to Chinese restaurants in Macau, my number ONE choice remains Jade Dragon at the City of Dreams. It is awarded Michelin 2 stars. I have always thought that it well deserves 3 stars, and it is much better than some other 3-star restaurants both in terms of food quality and meticulous service. The decor and the ambiance are first class. Having a meal there is having a superb dining experience that can’t be replicated elsewhere. Make it a point to dine at the Jade Dragon the next time you visit Macau. You will certainly want to come back for more."

Jade Dragon,50,Excelence in chinese food 🙏,"Two Michelin Stars and number 35 on the Asia 50 Best Restaurants.    The cantonese restaurant by Master chef Tam Kwok Fung is located in the city of Dreams, Nuwaa Macau, is really a destination. Everything's well balanced with fresh, healthy and organic ingredients. It's all about the ancient philosophy of well-being in a menu. I loved it."

Jade Dragon,40,Great taste on Simple food,"Colleague of 4 to enjoy a simply dinner at a luxurious restaurant. Restaurant recommended some simple food for us, which is out of our expectations and exceptional good, particular the fry eggs."

Jade Dragon,50,Excellence Chinese resturant,"the chef is very creative, BBQ pork is must try item here, deep fried oyster is very light and crispy, chinese herbal soup is good,  fried crab shell is very fresh and tasty, sliced paking duck is crsipy, steamed garoupa on egg white is fresh and you can taste the texture of the fish. very good experience! service is very good too."

Jade Dragon,50,Excellent Chinese food,This was my second time to visit Jade Dragon in Macau. The food were excellent and the food preparation also beautiful. Waiters were paying high attention for every single table. They also explained the dishes clearly and talked to us about Jade Dragon. Thank you very much for the hospitality. I have already recommended this restaurant with friend.

Jade Dragon,50,Must visit,"Again.... We had dinner and also lunch. Never disappointed in this restaurant. Good food, good service, good tea and good ambience. Food, must try the roasted goose and char siew. Service, very attentive servers, always around you. Tea, many varieties to choose from, but this...More"

Jade Dragon,50,Impressive Services,First time visit after heard so many reviews about Restaurant. Impressive with all staff and attention of services. We have great time and enjoy the various of Dim Sum and main dish. End with beautiful presentation of dessert as complimentary. We love it!!!

Jade Dragon,50,Wonderful dining experience,"I guess they offer the best dim sum I have ever had so far. The food, decoration, atmosphere, service are terrific. Will definitely come back again."

Jade Dragon,40,One of the best in town,"Jade Dragon is one of the best Chinese restaurant in town for me, the dishes are nice but the price is quite high as well. if you want to try the Chinese food in a luxury place, here is a good choice for you."

Jade Dragon,30,Disappointing,Had dinner with family. We were not wowed by the whole dining experience. The food was disappointing to say the least. The only nice touch was the personalized hand-written menu as a souvenir.

Jade Dragon,50,Concert weekend in Macau,This is one of the best Cantonese food I have ever tasted. Service was impeccable too. At the end of the mean you are presented with your own personalised menu of the items you ordered. It was a lovely experience.

Jade Dragon,50,Delicious dim sum,"Went for lunch and truely enjoyed the experience. Great food and services. Highly recommended the wagyu beef rice flour rolls, BBQ pork and BBQ pork pastry. The compliment desert was also amazing. Must booked in advance to avoid disappointment."

Jade Dragon,50,The best Chinese Restaurant,"Absolutely delicious. The best meal I had in Macau. Very expensive, but it is worth every penny. Definitely will come back and enjoy again. 是我在澳門吃到最好的中餐廳，很貴，但覺對值得，比8餐廳好吃。燒鵝有獨特的味道，而且幾乎每道菜都好吃，真是不容易。一定會推薦朋友來，有機會也絕對會再訪。"

De Librije,50,3*** worth for years allready!,"Everything is 3 star Michelin worthy. The food, staff, wines…not one complaint to find. Maybe one thing. The kitchen is a bit too sour for me. Everything has something sour in it. The rooms need an update to my opinion. But for the rest… it’s an incredible achievement to run this place for years in the the top in Europe. Chapeau!"

De Librije,50,Top top top you are the real guest with excellent food and service,"Top top top you are the real guest with excellent food and service  the entrance was superb, real warm welcome  we had a small issue , which was solved promptly  the food was the way it should be in a 3 star restaurant  the wines was payable and excellent , a compliment to the sommelier"

De Librije,50,Fantastic!,"This is the best food I have eaten in my life. Great service, lovely atmosphere and well chosen wines, but the perfection is in the food. We celebrated my birthday here with two vegetarian menu’s and were amazed. We loved the pumpkin that tasted like salmon, the magic of watermelon tartare and an amazing gado gado dessert. Magic!"

De Librije,30,Great and a lot,"Lovely setting, friendly staff, all dishes (close to) perfect and yet. We had perhaps in total 20 little dishes with all at least 5 ingredients prepared 3 different ways in 3 hours time (lunch). It's all just too much so there's not 1 dish that stood out, not 1 experience that we can remember.  What we will remember is the hostess in a way too tight outfit who we haven't seen smiling one time. The staff kept walking around, we liked the seating which is informal and facing the center of the courtyard (we sat next to each other which was very cozy and pleasant) , service was great, but cutlery was not always clean.  An experience definitely and we wouldn't want to have missed it (not even for 250 euro pp without drinks) but there's no 1 dish we will remember and we probably won't go back...  oh and parking an electric car in the vicinity... the car park with 400 lotz in total has only 2 for electric cars..."

De Librije,20,Birthday dinner for 2,"We had issues with hygiene. Both in the restaurant (dirty dishes/glasses) and in the restrooms. Definitely not what you would expect in a 3 star restaurant. If you are dining as a couple at the Librije you are seated next to each other but the tables are more or less in a circle so you all end up staring at each other. Food was good but not always warm by the time it gets to the table. Again, not a 3 Michelin star experience."

De Librije,50,Exceptional,"Exceptional even for takeaway. Highest quality ingredients, very tasty dishes and very reasonable value for the money"

De Librije,50,Defies convention with...convention,"Business lunch should always be like this...    This is probably the worlds most accessible three star Michelin restaurant. Very casual, very down to earth accessible with mind-blowing dishes with lots of thought, techniques and presentation both very old school and quite new school. Skill is not used for the sake of skill but to deliver the sensation, the experience and the emotion. Most memorable are the ‘ Broodje Paling’ and the ‘ Hunnebedden’. About the former: Based on local cuisine, the chefs personal taste, old technique, some table-side cooking and a very original cocktail this is a unique amalgation of both haute cuisine , Dutch Cucina Povere and originality. A very thought provoking take on eal sandwich. For me, this is Dutch culture at it’s best: Bravo!  Concerning ‘ Hunnebedden’: The young chef responsible for this dish deserves praise; this dish is a reimagination of ‘Desert’. Describing it does not do any justice to the experience. Surprise, wonder, reward comes to mind.  Highly recommended."

De Librije,50,"Without doubt great food,","Without doubt great food, inventive, beautifully presented, tasty and where possible local. After so many years it is still true 3 star quality. Service good but not exceptional, no soul. Wine list is good but by no way the best in the Netherlands. What is absolutely horrible is the interior of the restaurant, expensive for sure but a boudoir has usually better taste."

De Librije,50,simply the best,"You know that you're going to a 3 Michelin star restaurant, so what to expect? we've been to 1 and 2 star restaurants and there are differences but these are not spectacular. And than you visit the Librije....Wow, what an experience! From the welcome when you check in. till the check out next day, you are pampered and there is nothing to worry about. The dinner is simply the best we ever had. All plates, beautifully set and accompanied with great wines, a feast for the eye and the mouth. We'll be back!!"

De Librije,50,More than exceeded expectations,"We booked a lunch and hotel stay (the only way to enjoy book a table in the weeks we were in country). The reception at the hotel was already extraordinary and we got amazed further every hour after.  The food was not surprisingly amazing, but the service was outstanding as well.  Breakfast was even of such a quality and had so much attention to it, that we fear the disappointment at any hotel we will stay at next."

De Librije,30,"Great food, but sometimes poor service","We were looking forward to eating at Librije and would give the food 5 stars, it was amazing. We especially enjoyed the fish dishes and the duck, but the best dish for me was the steak tartare from watermelon, mindblowing how much flavour watermelon can have.    The reason we only give a 3 star rating is that the service was sometimes poor service. A few things happened that did not match our expectations of a three star restaurant and the price level. First, our water was not refilled automatically and after we notified the staff that we would like a refill of our water, we saw a waiter walking around with water and refilling the water at all tables except for our table. When our next course was served the staff saw that we still hadn’t got any water and then waiter came up to our table and said that there was a miscommunication and he asked if we want sparkling or still water. They should have asked directly and not waiting so long. Secondly, my girlfriends wine was served promptly, while I had to wait a while for my beer that matched the dish to be served. Finally, there was a mix up in the tea and coffee order. I got my girlfriends order and she got mine. Again, this wouldnt have bothered us at a “regular” restaurant, but it matters at this price point.    Positive regarding the service; Sommelier served me my favoriete beer that matched our desert and did not put on the bill. We had discussed craft beers during the evening and he had figured out that I would really like the Boon Kriek Mariage Parfait."

De Librije,50,Very special,One of the best in the Netherlands. We had the Librije menu which has 10 courses and on top de amuses.  Every course was special and we really enjoyed. The service was perfect as to be expected. The tour de cuisine was very nice and the eel we had there was a highlight.  Great place with a great team.

De Librije,40,"A very special experience, but......","It was an old wish to have dinner once at the Librije. We did recently. We had the ten course menu, which was completed with some five amuses. Some of the dishes were delicious, many were 'interesting'. They were composed of many ingredients and beautifully made up. It was made and served with much care by the big (and friendly) staff. But. It is all a question of taste, but I did not like the concept. You can hardly and mostly not recignize the food you are eating. All the courses were very tiny, in fact you get 15 amuses. Besides, you get the food on black or dark plates, and I prefer white ones. So it is very special, interesting, very good. It is an experience indeed, but it is not my piece of cake (which they do not serve, by the way)"

De Librije,50,Beyond superlatives..!,"Combining dinner (and breakfast) with a night at the hotel gets you into a dream shaped by the owners, Jonnie & Therese Boer, and their team. Dinning here is worth a travel as well as booking months in advance. The exquisite 8-courses preceded by surprising amuse-bouches was elegantly paired with a creative wine arrangement. The whole evening was extraordinary, immersed in a stylish, cosy and yet relaxed atmosphere. Unlike certain ""known"" restaurants we happened to try, no sign of misplaced posh at De Librije, we loved this! For us the memory of an outstanding, orgasmic piece of culinary tourism will long remain."

De Librije,50,By far the best Holland can bring!,"Surprise weekend for my wife in Zwolle. Only one place to celebrate it, that's at De Librije Hotel and restaurant. We parked our car in front of De Librije and had not even opened the doors of our car and the very helpful staff was already there. Excellent!  That evening we had a more than superb diner at the restaurant. Very relaxed atmosphere, super service in a warm ambiance. Enjoyed every second(!) of it. By far the best Holland can bring."

De Librije,50,"Memorable experience, natural feeling","We visited the Librije on a saturday evening. We decided to go for the 8 course menu, as 10 seemed a bit too much. We asked for pairing wines, with a focus on red wines (generally you end to get more whites than reds otherwise) .  During the menu we decided to extend with the cheese trolley.    The experience was nearly perfect (we only had to ask once for a refill of our water glasses) without getting pretentious. The focus is clearly on excellent food, much less on posh appearance.    We started off with a few amuses and then Jonny Boer came with the first course (as it is made from eel and other fish from his birth ground).  Then we got (a.o.) a crab salad, ceviche from lobster, a curry like dish, the famous librije egg with caviar, main was the dry aged duck and desert was fermented pineapple.    All dishes are served with a small card, describing the dish, to take home.    Interestingly we drank a variety of reds (and a champagne from Eric Rodez) with the dishes, that still were dominant (shell) fish (sometimes paired with duck liver). But they were were a good fit, a Regent from NL (""Kiss of Therese""), South African wine made from portugese grapes (Sijnn), a Montalcino wine (Troncone), Australian Cabernet Malbec Blend. Recioto Valpollicella . During the meal we got a tour through the kitchen and later also through the cellars. The meal ended with coffee and friandises."

De Librije,50,Absolutely amazing!!,"By far the best restaurant I have tried in The Netherlands, and fully deserves the 3 Michelin Stars it has earned. The service was impeccable and the menu was amazing ( we tried both the 10 course and the vegetarian menu ) and the wine was a good match ( have tried many better wines but it worked just fine ). Each dish was beautifully presented and many of the courses came with a story. The appetizers and especially the fish and duck was absolutely amazing. The desserts were nowhere near as good but still interesting and fine! Too bad the restaurant is over one hour drive from Amsterdam.. But definitely worth the trip!!You will need to book ahead as the restaurant is extremely popular ( 3/4 months but you can always try and call and hope for late cancellations)"

De Librije,50,This is huge!!,"Magistral experience. From entering the hotel to the full dining experience, service was exactly spot on up until the most tiny details. Every dish was a taste explosion. By far the best dining experience ever! Absolutely phenomenal!"

De Librije,50,"Down to earth establishment, out of this world food","Located in a repurposed prison the restaurant provides an interesting setting. Upon arriving our party was led to a lounge where aperetifs and amuses were served. The champagne was alright, non-alcoholic variant was forgettable. Amuses featured very basic ingredients but flavour was great.    The dining room itself is located in a skylit courtyard. The food itself is incredible, mostly humble ingredients with complex preparations from all over the world and balanced flavours. Some dishes were bold while others more subtle but all of them were refined.    Staff was casual, friendly and they didn't charge for extra coffee and wine which was a nice gesture you don't always find in this level of restaurant.    All in all a very pleasurable experience but don't expect them to lay down the red carpet for you, this really is all about the food."

De Librije,50,Hollands finest fine Dining!!,"The 3 Michelin star restaurant in Zwolle knows how to spoil there guests. The very best products, preperaired on a pure way and outstanding service! The spacious seats give a lot of privacy. The presentation of the dishes is very creative, it is a unique culinary experience!"

De Librije,50,Excellent at every level,"We booked the restaurant quite a time before our visit, perhaps 6 months.  We stayed in Amsterdam and caught the train to Zwolle and back. The train is a frequent service and runs very late.  The restaurant is a 15 minute walk from the station. No taxis in Zwolle was our experience so plan time for the walk.  Zwolle is delightful.  De Librije building is fabulous and I loved the art they had crammed inside.  Lounge and restaurant spaces very different but decor fabulous. Table spacing in restaurant very generous so other diners not intruding upon our space or conversation.  Service. Almost perfect. Had to ask for water but only because glasses are badly designed and staff cannot see when they are empty. A very professional team and goodness they work hard.  Food. We chose the seven menu. There are a large variety of options for your degustation which made me nervous on their part as I wasn’t sure why they wanted to tempt fate by introducing the complexity of so many options. The execution was almost perfect. Just two waits that seemed oddly lengthy when it looked to me that they were synchronising diners. Overall the experience from in to out took four hours which felt 30/45 minutes too long.  Food. Presentation flawless. Variety of flavours and textures excellent.  Food. Seven was though courses for us. We counted 15 dishes including all the amuse bouche and others. It felt generous.  Wine. We chose the cheapest bottle in the menu which was recommended on the first page of the list. I was very impressed that the menu would recommend a 45 euro bottle. And of course it was very satisfactory.  Theatre. Yes there is some accompanying theatre, colour and movement. We were very impressed both jonnie and therese spoke to us ( and everyone ) as part of the experience. We loved the kitchen tour.  Go to dish? For me it was langoustine so moist and flavoursome. Eggs, trout, duck and citrus all memorable dishes also.    Value. We paid AUD 880 (for two seven courses with one bottle of wine) excluding train to Zwolle which was AUD 130 return for two. Conversion rate of Aussie to Euro is 1.64 today. It’s expensive. Nevertheless I thought the experience was fabulous. We are both very pleased we went. We recommend the experience to anyone contemplating booking."

De Librije,50,De Librije is the Best 3 stars Michelin,"De Librije is the BEST 3 stars Michelin restaurant. It’s first time we tried to have 3 stars Michelin restaurant. We stayed in your hotel with the package - stay 1 night and with the dinner, included wine pairing. As I can’t drink too much. They deducted small price of my part. Their thoughtfulness is very attractive.  Thank you the team of De Librije gives us a perfect services and a top quality food, and the best experience in our life! We will keep continue going to have 3 stars Michelin restaurants in the world. Hope every 3 stars Michelin restaurant can give us such experience as De Librije."

De Librije,50,A fullfledged three star restaurant,"Everything matches their Michelin three star rating. Service is superb. Also the price matches. Naturally it is expensive, but it is worth it. I was introduced to an outstanding wine I did not know. A sommelier even offered to drive me back to the station, but it was a nice walk."

De Librije,50,"Dining at De Librije feels like experiencing a show: just sit back, watch, taste and enjoy the gastronomic ride.","Three Michelin stars, a reputation of the best restaurant in the Benelux ánd a former designation on the list of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. We had been very curious for prestigious restaurant De Librije in Zwolle, The Netherlands, for a long time and now we were given the opportunity to visit De Librije with our team. Our expectations were high.    We arrived at the impressive property, which used to be a prison from the 18th century. Five members of the staff were waiting for our arrival and welcomed us in an attentive and formal way. We immediately felt very welcome. While our coats were carried away by one of them, another one took us through the narrow corridors right to the lounge area. Well, this space did not always function as the ‘lounge area’ it is today: it used to be a prisoners cell. It felt strange and exciting at the same time to be aware of the fact that prisoners – men, women, children – served their sentences right at this place where at this moment a festive glass of bubbly Champagne was poured to us before our extensive royal meal would be served. Kind of sinister, but interesting and enthralling at the same time.    In this mysterious room surrounded by lots of natural elements, we were pleased to be welcomed by co-owner and renowned sommelier Thérèse de Boer. Her formal yet cordial hospitality and genuine interest secured us of the feeling we were in for a perfectly organized experience at her restaurant. Just in case we were not looking forward to our dinner already, several bites made sure to make us salivate for more, under which there was a crisp of Mangalitza bacon and a duo of celery and gherkin with mayonaise and piccalilli. The taste of each bite was delicate and refined and the presentation of the bites was purely outstanding. You could notice lots of attention had been given to the presentation and use of colors.    Our experience continued by Thérèse leading us the way to the restaurant area. A playful, open and light space full of round tables with rough, leather tablecloths on them. The place where the prisoners could receive their daylight was turned into a unique gastronomic ambiance. A nice thing about this space is that during lunch, you can enjoy the daylight because of the glass ceiling. Big plus is that you can really admire all photogenic dishes with optimal lighting this way!    At lunch, the same dishes are served as during dinner. During our visit, the impressive sounding 10-course ‘Librije menu’ was served to us, accompanied by 6 pairing premium wines selected by wine expert Thérèse de Boer herself.    Concerning the food and wines: in this article we will not explicitly point out that each dish and each glass of wine was so well balanced and tasteful. They all were, trust us. And even though the one dish could be considered more complex than the other, all courses – from the bread with butter on the table to the friandises – were of high quality in terms of the taste of ingredients, the presentation and originality.    All 10 courses of the menu had its own classical touch.    At first, chef Jonnie de Boer introduced himself to our table. While doing so, he presented several exciting amuses together with a little card from his small and typically Dutch hometown Giethoorn. Something personal, we like that! The presentation of the amuses made it worth admiring them all for a while before we had the pleasure to finally taste them. The soft tasting amuses truly did what they had to do: making us curious for more to come.    Oyster, goat cheese and seaweed is what came to us then. An unusual combination of unique flavors put together in a superb way. For the ones with a goat cheese allergy among our team, a plate of vegetarian steak tartare of dried water melon with piccalilli was served. Besides the subtle yet full and fruity taste, the contrast created by the combination of the spicy redness of the tartare and the grey plate made it a dish to remember.    De Librije is a restaurant where offal is a frequently used ingredient. Besides a piece of brown crab in juice of toasted celery, chicken liver and heart of veal could be found on the dish served to us as a second course. Classic and intense flavors. A glass of Chenin blanc full of acids and oak flavors was served with this course, which managed to create a rich, round taste in combination with the food.    The same wine turned out the be a great match with the third course as well: a tender piece of langoustine, prepared as ceviche in a fermented Japanese tea, combined with tomatoes, kombucha and snake beans. The sour tea found its balance through the high level of acids in the wine.    The fourth course – yes, we’re not even halfway yet – consisted of saibling, pumpkin, lovage and a juice of sherry and almonds. Now, how can it be possible that we have always eaten saibling without any juice of sherry and almonds?! The taste combination was exactly how it should be. An excellent wine, a Mâcon-Charnay of 100% chardonnay from 2017 from Winehouse Jean Maciat in France, was served in gigantic crystal glasses in order to bring out the specific, nutty character of the wine.    Oriental scents were coming out of the open kitchen when the fifth course came out of it. A curry with monkfish, nasturtium, screw tree and pandan rice was shining on our plates. Delicious.    ‘Egg caviar’ was the name of our sixth course. This course is considered a real classic of De Librije. Lukewarm egg yolk with cream and a dash of 10 grams of the finest caviar on top of it – what is there not to love here?    Another classic on the menu formed the seventh course. First, Thérèse poured us a glass of Pombal do Vesuvio Douro from 2015, originating from the North of Portugal, which had been matured in wood for over 14 months. The wine went great with the natural and earthy tones coming out of the food: veal sweetbread with spicy pineapple and shrimps in peanut sauce. An interesting combination of ingredients that each had an intense taste on its own.    This dish illustrates one of the powers of chef Jonnie de Boer and De Librije: the ability to make dining an actual experience through providing surprising and tricky food combinations which can sometimes even be a bit uncomfortable. That’s when it gets fun. The art is to still let such a dish make sense at the same time and we think Jonnie de Boer is a true artist in this respect.    The eighth course consisted of ‘Ermelo’s duck’ which had been dried for two days, stuffed with hay and dandelion and then matured in parafine for ten days in order to draw the flavors as much as possible. After this process, the duck had been fried on its carcass and then cut in the form of a T-bone. Next to the duck, our plate was filled with marinated duck skin with meat offal in it, ragout of the stomach of the duck and a juice of fermented celery. Again, in our opinion this was an intense and deeply tasteful dish presented in a unique way.    A very interesting Macvin du Jura was brought to us to go with the ninth course: a traditional Macvin of chardonnay (non-fermented grape juice mixed with Marc de Jura) which aged on wood for three years and resulted in a fine dessert drink of 17,5% alcohol and sweet, earthy tones which immediately let us think of the strong, old tasting flavors of rye bread. With this wine, we received a dish of red cheese from the Bourgogne with chorizo, potato juice and tiny rabbit kidneys. Yes, cheese and rabbit kidneys.    A lovely intermezzo was created through introducing De Librije’s ice cream car at our table. We got to pick our favorite ice cream. All ice cream was homemade and inspired by summery blossom flowers.    Then the grand finale followed: a dessert made up of various citrus fruits, each in a different bowl. The first bowl was about salt. It was filled with orange and salted caramel. The second bowl had a sweet theme and had blood orange as a main ingredient. Sour was the taste of what was inside the third and last bowl: citrus with cucumber.    After our dessert, we were invited for a tour in the kitchen. It was impressive to see the hardworking staff fully focussed on preparing only the best for their guests.    Our dining experience – and it was an experience indeed – ended with a cup of fine coffee and friandises made by reputable patisserie Bontom, all nicely presented on wooden roots on a trolley.    All in all, our heigh expectations have truly been met. Dining at De Librije feels like experiencing a show: just sit back, watch, taste and enjoy the gastronomic ride. We don’t advise you to go here when you are someone who says ‘I rather don’t eat this or that’ in advance – but in case you are in for some surprises and oddities, De Librije is the food jail get entertained. Trust Jonnie and Thérèse de Boer to take you through the different spaces of the restaurant and be openminded for them sharing all the carefully selected fine food and beautiful wines with you. It’s truly a special experience, without any fuss, ending with a standing ovation."

SaQuaNa,50,Amazing,Refreshingly good food. Best toilets I’ve ever seen. The cleanest of clean . Highly recommend !

SaQuaNa,50,"Delicious food, caring staff and insane value for money","Lovely food and caring staff. They accommodated our little infant with such kindness. The lunch serving was GREAT. The value for money is way above anything else this close to the center of the town, possibly way above anything else i’ve tried. Their dishes combine tastes in a way you would only expect in capital cities. When you’re sick of the Bassin and the galettes, treat yourself at least once at this wonderful place."

SaQuaNa,50,Perfect,"Inventive, perfectly executed, flawless service. We have booked to come again on our last night in Honfleur, simply too many dishes to choose from despite the small menu. Thank you."

SaQuaNa,50,A Great Experience!,Another great gastronomic stop in my Normandy touring. Not only Honfleur is a wonderful town with many art galleries and historic landmarks to visit; the food trail discovery was awesome.  SaQuaNa is a fantastic place to discover Japanese cuisine with a truly modern twist.  A place not to be missed when visiting Honfleur that I highly recommend.

SaQuaNa,50,Amazing Restaurant .. One Bad Apple ..,"I don't write many reviews but this time I felt I should .. It addresses specifically my original waiter, the very tall and skinny, the one who took my order .. I asked a few questions about the wine (Pot de Vin from the Guilhem family) and I can say the answers were more arrogant than friendly.  More on the ""you obviously don't know anything about wine, so let me make you feel stupid"" by telling me what something means ..  1) I asked what VDF meant beside the description and he bluntly said ""Vin de France"", as if it was obvious (he said ""c'est logique"", and then smiled). After having eaten 35 times in restaurants in 35 days, from Carcassonne to Saint-Malo, passing through Saint-Emilion, Bordeaux, Cahors, Chinon, Saumur Champigny, la Rochelle, le Croisic, and I'm going to skip a bunch, and having looked at 35 wine lists, I don't recall VDF. Many times you can see VDP (Vin de Pays), but not VDF, For me it's obvious it's a wine from ""France"" when it is listed under the Languedoc region on the wine list.  2) I asked if it was 100% merlot, and he again answered as if it was another stupid question, when it is written the ""cepage"" on the bottle it is ""because"" it is 100% from those grapes .. Well my dear friend, it is NOT written merlot on the bottle but ONLY on your wine menu and ""en parenthese"", which is why I ASKED. And just so you know my tall friend, it is NOT 100% merlot as it is clearly written 1) on the bottle itself ""issu DES CEPAGES TRADITIONNELS de la Famille Guilhem and 2) in the cepage""s"" description's on the website, but ""majoritairement merlot, so it is an ""assemblage"". So much for being arrogant in answering my questions .. and now you must be put back in your place .. doesn't feel good I'm sure .. (ps to management: you might want to change the description on the wine list and take away the word merlot, so it doesn't confuse this waiter)  I any case I did ask another question later in the evening to see how another individual would answer from the restaurant. This time the ""responsable de la salle a manger"" (I hope I got that right), and he Nicely answered me like a client should be answered, any questions, good or bad .. your job as a waiter is to engage in friendly conversation and make the customer feel comfortable, something you seem to NOT have been able to do with me at least .. and again I repeat I have done 35 restaurants in the last 35 days, so I have met many waiters. Here's a tip, take every customer as if they were your mother.  I gave the restaurant a 5/5, no use in spoiling a review on one bad apple. It will eventually fall from the tree and be eaten by hungry birds ..

SaQuaNa,10,Absolutely dreadful,"Booked for dinner on the last night of our stay in glorious Honfleur. Being Michelin recommended I anticipated a fabulous dinner! We had a Champagne aperitif and settled down to nibble the bread and ponder the menu. My wife and I both love Sashimi so asked our waitress what was so special about their ‘8 piece premium platter’ @ €23 as opposed to their 20 piece @ €30? “Oh it’s very special, the chef takes great care” Great, let’s have that then and a bottle of €70 White Burgundy” …. Well all I can say is the wine was lovely but the so called premium platter was absolutely dreadful. The fish was dry and warm and the whole platter looked like it had been made several hours previously and obviously not kept refrigerated. As if that wasn’t bad enough, my wife asked for some Wasabi only to be told abruptly that, “You don’t have Wasabi with this dish” I said we’d like some anyway please but it turns out they didn’t have any! Really? A Michelin restaurant service Sushi and Sashimi that doesn’t use Wasabi? “Have you been to Japan?” I asked with a wry smile … I realised we had made a grave error of judgement, ate up and went back to our apartment for a bread and cheese supper."

SaQuaNa,30,All right,"We probably expected a bit more, because this place really looks splendid from outside. Breakfast was all right, but the bread was not really fresh, and there was not enough."

SaQuaNa,50,Bello e buono,Very nice restaurant! Excellent service and good food! We ate fish dishes and desserts. Everything tasted good. Service is fast and waiters are very polite! Highly recommended :)

SaQuaNa,20,Overrated and food without taste,Extreamly disappointed. The food at Saquana was boring and without taste and even the chicken was dry. Everything could have been much better tasting and interesting except for the bread which was of really good quality. All dishes sounded inspiring and the disappointment when we got it was even bigger because of that.    Nice personnel though.

SaQuaNa,50,Wow—an amazing meal!,"Make a special trip to Honfleur for SaQuaNa. We had the “red” menu for lunch. Each course was outstanding—which were paired with lovely wines. The scallop, trout and lamb courses were all perfectly cooked with great delicacy and balance. Simply superb. The service was outstanding."

SaQuaNa,50,Faultless. ....,"faultless....  having been to Honfleur many times over the years, i have visited many local restaurants but seem to have missed this one, probably due to the outside looking like an office more than a restaurant and only found it via TA.  So glad we did, not cheap by any standards and if your not a 'set menu' person then it might not work for you but what you get is faultless, not surprising they have two michelin stars.  My first dinner stop when over again    https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187189-d797717-r733049253-SaQuaNa-Honfleur_Calvados_Basse_Normandie_Normandy.html#"

SaQuaNa,50,Excellent lunch and fine service,"We were on a land tour in Normandy and stopped in one of my favorite towns around lunch time. I had checked out the restaurants and found SaQuaNa, a Michelin 2-star spot, was open for lunch. We stopped in to see if there was a table for two, but the hostess acted as if we were stupid tourists who didn't know what we were doing, and showed us a menu, with prices, which were high, but not exorbitant. So, we asked for a table. There were several amuse bouches before the actual meal was served. All were delicious, and they were able to accommodate my girlfriend's menu substitutions. After several courses, including the fish, meat, and salad course, we had to leave to rejoin our tour group, and skip the cheese and dessert courses. Nevertheless, everything was excellent. I wish we could go back to finish the meal. (Note that some say that SaQuaNa is Asian, but to me it's pure French, perhaps with minimal Asian influences)."

SaQuaNa,50,Best dinner of my life,"Every course was a delight and a few of them were transcendent. I was blown away by the flavors and beauty of each of the eight course, most with seafood, and moved to tears by the meal as a whole. 😍😭 Thank you, SaQuaNa!"

SaQuaNa,50,Elegant and Personable,"We had a lovely evening at SaQuaNa. The service of course was impeccable. The food was very fine, the desserts were a highlight for me. The duck preparation was also divine. I appreciated that although it’s a 2 Michelin star restaurant, it’s unpretentious. It wasn’t food magic for me, which has only ever happened once (Mirazur, Mentón FR), but it was absolutely excellent."

SaQuaNa,10,A dreadful end to our visit.,"Having booked saquana many months ago to celebrate my partners birthday we were very much looking forward to the evening.  The first 4 courses were good and service was efficient.  Unfortunately, before our duck arrived the lady on the next table started to be violently sick. Not the fault of the restaurant but the way they dealt with it was a disgrace, allowing the lady to continue to be sick at the table and not moving her to a toilet area. This left my partner feeling ill herself and desperate to leave to get away from the smell that was rapidly enveloping the restaurant. I asked to pay the bill for what we had already had and paid with my only thought being to get out as quickly as possible.  On examining the bill later, the restaurant had given a very small reduction on the actual bill despite us missing 3 courses and ruining a long planned birthday.  Clearly it was more important to not upset their regulars despite their disgraceful behaviour than to ruin the night of 2 visitors.  The managements comments that the lady was a little bit ill were blatantly obvious but if a customer is being violently sick, move them to the toilet not provide a plastic bin to allow them to keep being sick at the table!!  Thank you for ruining our trip to honfleur. 350 euros NOT VERY WELL SPENT!!"

SaQuaNa,50,World Class!,"Honfleur is a gorgeous, old, port and very worth the visit after seeing the Normandy beaches. But this restaurant is absolutely worth the drive by itself. Dishes were small and subtle. Wine superb. Service perfect. Ambience quietly elegant. Memorable!!"

SaQuaNa,50,Top restaurant !!,We visited this restaurant for lunch with two kids (age 11 and 9). We were very well received and the dishes were all at high high level with good creativity. Only negative was that the chef did not visit the tables.

SaQuaNa,50,A Great Meal,"This is a top restaurant - Excellent wait staff - helpful and friendly, especially so with translations We had 5 courses (+) and each were beautifully presented and cooked. Unable to fault. Wine list great too. Not a cheap restaurant but a wonderful special occasion place."

SaQuaNa,40,A quiet oasis in a crowded town,"We were in Honfleur on a very busy holiday weekend and so appreciated escaping into the serene setting of SaQuaNa. The service was quietly excellent, the food was always beautiful, and the sommelier was very capable and respectful of the limits we put on price. As to the food itself, it was variable. Some courses were exquisite, whereas others were nothing special, and occasionally there was a clear miss. For example, the cheese course was a strange concoction of green peas mixed with something (perhaps a fresh cheese), topped by a crisp of cheese. I would have greatly preferred a selection of wonderful French cheeses. Given the price, I would have liked for everything to have been delicious, but it was still a nice evening, and I appreciate the chef's aim to have a lighter cuisine than la cuisine Normande."

SaQuaNa,40,Lovely experience,"The service at this beautiful restaurant was lovely. The presentation of the food amazing and the delightful little extras added to the night. We had the rouge menu and were struggling to finish. Can’t say I loved all the courses, especially the blood sausage which I was looking forward to, and the salad was very disappointing given all the great salads in France. I loved the duck and the dessert and the wonderful  experience for someone not so used to fine dining"

SaQuaNa,50,"SAVEUR, QUALITÉ, NATURE... SAQUANA .....Do not miss, à ne pas manquer","3rd time in roughly 2 years, each time the menu has evolved and the people I brought to discover the place left it with dreams..  Some unexpected association of flavours with work delightfully well.  I ll recommend the olive menu with looks bigger than it is.  Each plates size is well though that one can go through all the courses.  I found the service of better quality (was good, but now it higher). As staff has changed.  Water (still or sparkling) is complementary.. which is far from being the case in most 2 stars (which will make you pay easily 10euros a bottle)..  Wine is well priced.    Will DEFINITIVELY go back again..    Do not forget to reserve as it has only 24 seats."

SaQuaNa,50,Superb,"What a great place !    - I loved the surroundings  - service was really good (not as ""present"" than for a ***, but perfectly decent and professional...and with the extra nice touch)  - lots of little innovations there and there (like the knives)  - fantastic bread and butter  - very well researched wine list  - now to the ""main"", the food. It ranged between exceptional and good. But all dishes were very innovative  My favorites were the Lotte with coconut, the lobster with risoto, and the last desert (truffled cream and nougatine, just awesome). Only the beef disappointed  Wonderful ideas, close to perfect execution...    Far from home, but hope I can return"

SaQuaNa,50,World class,"We visited during the summer heatwave and the menu perfectly reflected the weather. From the light Asian broth with monkfish starter to the salad served with grilled beef everything was light, in season and delicious.  The sweet/savoury pancake ( in the UK a version of a Yorkshire pudding) is fantastic and helps to give the restaurant it's identity.  The room is also light, modern and relaxed.  A lot of French restaurants, at this level, go down the thick carpet and linen route but Sa Qua Na has the confidence to go it's own way.  A husband and wife owned business, both are at the top of thier professions. Madame was warm, welcoming and pleased to explain everything.  I really loved this place and wish them every success in the future.  I hope I will return soon"

SaQuaNa,40,Super,"Well worth a visit. Nice touch: water is free, prices of wine are reasonable and they have a child menu (all not easily found in michelin restaurants)"

SaQuaNa,50,sophisticated and elegant,nevertheless minimalistic and food in perfect harmony. Very nice and competent staff. The food was a taste trip beyond the usual in a kind of duet between the French and Japanese kitchen. The sommelier wine selection perfect. The whole dinner was one of the best I have eaten. Worth every penny!

SaQuaNa,40,My visit,Tonight I ate at this restaurant with my partner. The presentation of the food was exquisite and the service faultless. The restaurant should be commended for accomodating my partners garlic allergy and adjusting dishes accordingly. I enjoyed my meal and embraced new flavours I had not experienced. The food was not to my partners palate though he appreciated the brilliance of each presentation!  At the end of the meal the maitre d' asked me how I enjoyed my meal which of course had a positive feedback but she did not my partner who had sent back food uneaten....the skill and presentation were appreciated but it was just not his palate! He would have enjoyed the opportunity to give feedback.

SaQuaNa,50,Gorgeous!,It's truly alchemy what happens in the kitchen of SaQuaNa - mixing other substances to get gold.    The best restaurant during our trip to Normandy.    The Madame of the House is charming and smiling and this compensates the lack of warmth of few of the waiting staff.    Definitely recommended!

JAN,10,Not great,"I was very disappointed. A Michelin star should indicate quality, but this is not the case. The food was bland, we were left waiting between courses and the cheese room was unexceptional, and we had to ask the distracted staff for a drink. On the whole I am surprised they maintain a star, not worth it."

JAN,50,"Wonderful dinner and Nice breakfast with the Big Dipper, Rusks, we got from you.","Thank you for a fantastic evening. The food and wine was excellent. See you next summer. Jorgen and Lotta from Stockholm, Sweden."

JAN,50,A culinary must,Absolutely amazing! One of the best culinary experiences ever. Thank you to everyone at JAN for creating such culinary magic.

JAN,40,"Excellent food, mediocre service.","We have been to several 2 star but this was our first 1 star Michelin restaurant. It was disappointing. The food was excellent but not the service. First, they seated us by the kitchen, even though there was another table but they insisted (maybe because we are Americans?). Second, the menu said the main course was fish, so I ordered white wine, but it was beef. Third, the cheese course is across the street, so you don’t have your wine, and I had to ask for water. Fourth, I had to ask the staff for the rest of our white wine to be poured as they were ignoring us. If this was a regular restaurant then the quality of the food would outweigh these issues, but as an expensive Michelin restaurant, it was disappointing compared to the others we have experienced."

JAN,50,Great celebratory occasion,"Amazing experience, much more than just dinner. I had reservations about the mix of flavours but wow they were amazing. Carried through the authentic taste of South African culture."

JAN,50,Best dining experience ever,"This is without a doubt the best dining experience I’ve ever had. From start to finish it was perfect, having the cheeseboard presented as an entire separate building (just across the street) was a highlight, walking in and seeing a grand table laid up with 91 dishes was phenomenal and all of the pairings were so well thought out. The whole tasting menu was impeccable as was the service."

JAN,50,An explosion of flavours,"This was one of the best meals I have ever had. I’ve been around a while and eaten at many great restaurants. This was as good as it gets. Amazing service. Fabulous food. Just blown away. A great chef has a special knack for combining ingredients that others may not have thought of, yet they work incredibly well. That is Jan. Every dish would explode in your mouth with flavour. Just loved this restaurant. What a gem."

JAN,50,More than worth the visit,"What a lovely place. We went there for dinner during our stay in Nice. The restaurant is not very large but very nice decorated. Everybody is very friendly and makes your stay unforgetable.  The kitchen is French/South African style and they serve very good pairing wines with the menu (we choose the French and South African wines). The most fantastic experience in this restaurant is the wonderfull cheese 'room' at the opposite of the restaurant. A very nice lady invited us to join her for the cheese course. When you enter the room you will find a couple of tables where you can sit and in the middle of the room you will see a large table with lots of different cheese / drinks / bread etc. We told the lady that we would like to skip the dessert and just stay in this room but unfortunately we had to go back to the restaurant. Even as expectations for the dessert were now very high, also the dessert was just delicious.  Nothing more to say - just give this restaurant a try when you are in Nice."

JAN,50,Wonderful experience,We had a wonderful experience at this Michelin restaurant. As South Africans we are very proud of Jan and his team for the exceptional food that they produce. We opted for the Signature experience with wine paring. This included a few good South Afican wines. The Amuse-Bouche with the braaibroodjie and the biltong was so different from anything we know and wonderful. Every dish was excellent. The visit to Maria where we enjoyed a variety of cheeses and preserves was a fun experience. A great evening not to be forgotten.

JAN,50,Phenomenal!!,"This was not just a meal, this was a dining experience of a lifetime. The artistry of Chef Jan that transforms simple, fresh and colorful ingredients into a masterpiece is truly an experience. We visited Jan on our anniversary trip this month. We were invited into the mind and imagination of Chef Jan. We trusted him and his staff to provide a wonderful experience, and it was phenomenal. The cheese room, in honor of Chef Jan’s mother, was an over the top experience. This is truly a must visit experience when in Nice. LOVED IT!!!"

JAN,40,An amazing eating experience!,This was an amazing tasting dinner experience. At least 6 different offerings- presented beautifully with some ceremony. Top of the line for a special occasion- we celebrated my birthday- it is out of this world presentation and execution. There were so many different attractive and tasty items that I might suggest you be judicious so that your stomach will adjust kindly.

JAN,50,Once in a lifetime meal,"One of the best meals of my entire life. If you have the opportunity, you must go here. It is pricey but totally worth it. From the non-alcoholic cocktail (Hibiscus) to the honey sesame and hazelnut finale, this meal was sublime. The setting, impeccable service, and creative but substantial food courses all came together for an unforgettable experience. Some highlights the night we visited were a fish from Nice with dill, lemongrass and puffed spelt and a skipjack apple and smoked mussel dish. After several courses, they walk you across the street to experience the most amazing cheese room you'll ever see. The cheeses, preserves, condiments (such as candied sage and rose petals from their gardens) are all expertly paired. The portions are also the right size - not too large or small. I will remember this meal for a very long time and plan to return to Nice just to visit JAN again someday."

JAN,50,Where Chic Meets Artistry in a Refined but Understated Setting,"This was an elevated and inspired culinary experience in a cozy and chic environment, bathed in impeccable service.    Although the restaurant leans on very traditional cultural (South African) roots, the expression is nothing short of an exquisite contemporary culinary art form, executed with precise and flawless technique and complex layering.    That said, the main course featured a more traditional rendition of the dish along side the deconstructed and highly decorated nouveau version. Perhaps pairing the two wasn’t such a good idea: I found grandma’s original version much more satisfying than the elegant performance art.    Thanks to the sommelier for the inspired pairings! Moreover, The cheese experience was unique in so many ways.!    Finally, a tribute to the restaurant is that it attracts lovely people from around the world. The fondest and most enduring memory I’ll have of the evening was of engaging, Esther, a diner sitting at the table next to us. Esther is a vivacious and charming octogenarian chef with experience from around the world, who’s heart and mind reflect the essence of humanity and dedication to the culinary arts.    Thank you to Restaurant Jan for bringing us all together for a perfect evening!!"

JAN,30,Sorta average Michelin star restaurant,"Great effort by chef, kitchen, service staff. Very meticulous. Amazing service. However, because everything was so meticulous, the meal gets stretched out significantly — I could see it easily getting to 4 hours. First few rounds of food are very interesting (in a good way); the mains were disappointing. Hard to explain - perhaps salty and taste that I would expect at a normal restaurant (despite so much effort that I can plainly see). I’ve been to six Michelin restaurants and I would put this restaurant around average in that pack (I’m more there for the food and wine versus service)"

JAN,50,The best restaurant meal of my life,"Anyone that gives this restaurant a poor review is either delusional or they work for a competing restaurant.    Absolutely hands-down the best meal of my entire life. And I’m 75 years old. You cannot believe this meal and experience. The cheese course has 91 items in the cheese course. You go to an entirely different restaurant to have the cheese course. I have eaten at a lot of Michelin star restaurants and really not enjoyed any of them. This is the only Michelin star restaurant I enjoyed and will remember for the rest of my life even if I live to be 105. If this restaurant only has one star, I can’t imagine the criteria For two stars or three stars. This is an entirely different level of food and experience. Do not miss."

JAN,50,Wow,"Dinner here was truly exceptional. The food was amazing. The cheese course was decadent. Meeting the chef was an unexpected delight. But over and above all of that was the exceptional service, which absolutely exceeded expectations. What an amazing experience - so happy to have had the opportunity to partake."

JAN,30,Very disappointing,"According to the review I was expecting something great for this one star Michelin, It did not started well we had to wait more than 30 min before someone came to our table ! Brasserie service not professional at all!!  We took the tasting menu with wine pairing , some dishes were ok some so so , the bobotie pumpkin and lentill , really a dish from a one star chef? The wine pairing was really a disaster and a pricy disaster , 120€ ! They did not offer to taste each wine , the serving was so little that I thought it was for tasting! Really big disappointment , does not deserve its one star !"

JAN,50,Breathtaking experience at JAN!,"It has been almost 2 months since we dined at JAN and we are still revelling in the beauty of the experience. It is hands down the best restaurant we have eaten at! JAN is dining at its finest and what makes it remarkable is that the food, textures and flavours are true to their form! Sometimes chefs are a bit on the fancy side and create a menu that is unrecognisable. But not JAN. He is a purist.    Every detail is taken care of from the crisp, perfectly ironed tablecloths, wonderful service, exceptional wines, and food that was a truly special blend of French and South African cuisine. We loved the ritual at the beginning, the theatre that is Marie across the road (for those interested in adding the cheese option - do it, it is spectacular and the best cheese board you'll ever experience)!!! Jan has gone above and beyond to refine every detail in his restaurant. The music, art, and even the bathroom was beautiful, nostalgic and special with a touch of drama.    We are very proud that Jan has done so well representing South Africans on a global stage!! We will definitely be back and will be certain to visit his other restaurants, including the new one recently opened in South Africa. Thank you JAN and team for a truly memorable and exquisite dining experience!"

JAN,50,Best food/experience of the entire trip,"My fiancee and I made a reservation for JAN months before our trip as we saw this place books up quickly and we were so glad we did. We ordered the Menu Diamant, which was a 7 course meal and a bottle of red wine. We aren't super knowledgeable with wine, but told them what we liked and you would've thought our waiter was a sommelier! It was perfect to what we love. Every course from the amuse bouche to the last dessert dish was beyond what words could ever describe. Every bite was superb and felt like it was made special for us. The waitstaff were all extremely knowledgeable and eager to answer any questions or fulfill any whims of ours. As part of our order, we were able to experience the cheese room (Maria) across the street before dessert. Everything I said about JAN applies to Maria as well. It was an amazing collection of cheeses and treats that were a perfect compliment to the meal we just had. The waitstaff was also extremely hospitable and knowledgeable. The waitstaff there came over to us as we were eating to ask if we had any questions and he even offered advice to pair a cheese I chose with a chocolate and it was just a perfect combination. The guy knows his cheese! JAN is definitely the most expensive restaurant that we went to but we do not regret it as it was an experience we still look back on and cherish. This was the highlight of our trip and highly recommend it to everyone who visits Nice."

JAN,50,Outstanding,Terric meal and imaginative cooking. We do not normally do Michelin star place but this ticked all the boxes ..stunning!

JAN,10,Asked to leave after 90mins,Turfed out after 90 minutes - have visited before and the standard has fallen dramatically especially the size and quality of ingredients. Was mortified as brought a friend to show them. The worst experience I’ve had in the South of France

JAN,50,Amazing dinner!!! Don't miss the cheese room,"We read all the positive reviews and booked a dinner for our last night in Nice.  Everything was perfect! The place itself, the service and the food & wine- WOW!  We have been to other Michelin star restaurants but this is the best experience so far! We took the 1st option of the wine pairing, highly recommended! My partner does not eat meat, and I only eat fish- the options we got instead of meat were really amazing. Do not miss the cheese room!! So worth it.....it felt like Wonderland.  Do arrive hungry, as there are many dishes."

JAN,50,Excellent South-african Michelin star restaurant,"We visited an October Friday at 6 pm and had the Menu Crystal with 6 servings among other an excellent deconstructed version of the South-african dish Bobotie. The two types of bread were a.o. accompanied by an outstanding olive oil. As we would like a bottle of local white wine the sommelier recommended Clos Saint-Vincent from Bellet situated less than 10 miles north of Nice. The grape is Vermentino and this wine was for us an excellent companion to the entire meal. Service was quick, competent and friendly."

JAN,50,You must have dinner here,"We were 3 that went for the dinner, the experience were out of the world, you cannot believe all the flavour that they get into each and every dish. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. It is expensive but definitely worth what you pay."

JAN,50,An Amazing Experience!,"Let me start my review by saying our reservation was accidentally canceled (probably my fault) but Pascal and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us. My sister had purchased a gift voucher for Jan in South Africa instead of Nice, and once again the staff worked diligently to straighten things out. It took many phone calls. They were gracious. Kudos.    From the moment you are greeted, it’s a 5 star experience. We started our meal with one of the many servers bringing out a big silver bowl, two white towels and a pitcher of rosemary and lavender infused water. You put your hands over the bowl while the water is poured over them and you then dry them with your white towel. A good way to introduce you to the fact that you are going to have a night like maybe you’ve never had.    Every single server or sommelier spoke English. Not perfect English but enough that you could ask questions and get answers. You were able to hear the explanation of your wine, where it was from and what notes and complexities it has (their words, not wine). After our hand washing we ordered an aperitif. Jim had a Martini and I had a very expensive glass of champagne, but I can tell you it was a great palate opener for the rest of our experience. I’m not a good describer of food, so you are going to get impressions instead of details. Better yet. Make a reservation and taste for yourself.    Four bite sized savory pastries or tarts were served on a big fluffy napkin flower. You are instructed by your server which pastry to start with and then to proceed clockwise, recommended by the chef. Each delectable bite was a little explosion in your mouth, starting with creamy and ending with a crunchy South African bite to finish. The chef is South African.    We then went on to choose our wine pairings. Jim went for the premium pairing. Premium pairings would be lost on me, so I stayed with the choice pairings. Our next course with a white wine was summer truffle with ancient grains. The truffle was unlike anything I’ve ever tasted. Cannot describe. I wanted to lick the bowl but then I was tempted to lick the bowl after every course.    On to the next course with a different white wine. Incidentally, their wine choices perfectly complemented the course. Pure delight. The next item on our prix fixe menu was fish from the Nice Harbor, apple, chorizo, haddock and tête de moine. Here you could add a supplement of caviar and I did! I’m 64 years old and have never tried it.  Once again, I will not attempt to convey the taste with my words. I wish there was a device that captured taste. I only know I leaned back in my chair and said “I am so happy, so lucky.“    And then onto the next course which was a plate of little rounds of beef, beets and other veggies with a sumptuous brown sauce. Two pieces of bread, one brioche and the other a hearty grain with a little knife already spread with butter and herbs and a plate of olive oil to dip. Once again, heavenly. This was served with a very light red wine.    Dessert was wonderful, sago, rose, strawberry and litchi. All I can tell you is I took my spoon and tried to get every last drop out of the bowl. Think a meringue with an explosion of fresh strawberries when you cut into it with a thick cream poured over the top. This course was served with a sweet dessert wine, something I would not have chosen but worked perfectly.    Finally, since it was my birthday, we were served an assortment of small delicacies, one of which had a candle in it. Crème brûlée but so much better, a chocolate truffle and more.    We did want to add on the cheese tastings but could not eat another bite.    This is one of the most memorable meals of our lives. I will not try to replicate it. Some things are better left to memory."

JAN,50,Can't Say Enough Good Things,"This was our first night of a 6-night south-of-France vacation (part of a celebration for my wife’s birthday) and it was nothing short of exceptional. We came for a 6:15 dinner reservation which was in theory 4 courses, plus we had added on the cheese course. The restaurant itself is dark and intimate. Drinks were well-made (excellent negronis) and we appreciated that they weren’t pushy with the wine menu (as neither of us are huge wine enthusiasts).    The courses themselves were delicious, with excellent presentation, attentiveness from waiters, and a good pace – everything you would expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. Despite getting the lower-course menu, we were surprisingly full, but still powered through to the cheese course, being led to the restaurant across the street. As noted by other reviewers, this is effectively a table laden with all manner of amazing cheeses, accompanying jams, nuts, and similar items – a larger-than-life cheese board that you can graze and bring back to your table at your leisure. At some point, we took up the offer of wine and were offered some compliments of the chef. We also received some lovely desert with a candle in honor of my wife’s birthday, something we didn’t already receive from allegedly better-classed restaurants, despite my noting the occasion when I booked. We also received a visit from the chef which while not expected from everyone Michelin-restaurant, is always a fun touch, as well as a photo-book about the chef and the restaurant, signed by him and the staff – a very cool souvenir.    There’s no doubt that this place is on the way to its next Michelin star – I hope that this level of quality and care does not change even as Jan continues to rise"

JAN,50,The best Michelin restaurant,Over the years have been to many Michelin restaurants this was by far the best we have been too. The staff were amazing every dish was delivered with a full description and informative staff. Great wine menu and the cheese room was something else.

JAN,50,BEST FOODIE EXPERIENCE EVER,"Drop everything when you are in Nice and visit Restaurant JAN, from the moment you enter the restaurant you are transported to the Chef's vision and fine eye for detail. The interior is out of this world and a world class establishment.    The staff is incredible, extremely friendly/ knowledgeable and where do I begin to explain the food. Every dish is carefully curated, from texture right through to taste.    This is 3-star Michelin quality."

JAN,50,Delicious food; serving at perfection,"This was by no doubt one of my best fine dining experiences ever, and the first along with my girlfriend. We knew virtually nothing about the South African cuisine before we came here. The restaurant blends the South African with local French and Asian tastes. We really enjoyed it. The staff made the serving at perfection. We could have skipped the cheese buffet, because we were so stuffed at that point, but on the other hand, it was so rich. We would gladly recommend!"

JAN,50,Amazing experience,"It was an amazing experience. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable and if you are a fan of French cheese make sure you add on the cheese course if you are going for the 4 course menu, you won’t be disappointed."

JAN,50,Elite level dining,"Absolutely sensational from start to finish. Worth its Michelin star. Superb food, service and setting. Obviously expensive, but treat yourself if you can"

JAN,50,A MUST,A wonderful experience for any food lover. Make the efford as for me it ticked box of have to do....

JAN,50,Fine dining with a big heart - absolutely lovely!,"JAN serves up a wonderful combination of French and South African cuisine that is nothing short of spectacular. Truly one of the best restaurants in town, if not the best of all. Fine dining with high ambitions that are fulfilled with every dish that is served in the set tasting menus. The cheese serving where you cross the street and enter the cheese room is to die for. I've been to JAN three times since it reopened after the pandemic and I have never been disappointed."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Superb restaurant! Fantastic food and service.,"A great experience. Celebrated 50 years of friendship with old friend, sadly one of the trio was admitted to the hospital the day before so could not join us. The service is excellent and meticulous as one might expect from a Michelin 3 starred restaurant but the personnel were warm, friendly and made for a pleasant experience. The food is absolutely amazing. Every course in the large Degustation menu was superb, visually and of course, with incredible quality. A real taste sensation with some of the combinations and sauces. The beverage and wine offering is vast and will please anyone. The pre menu welcome bites were a nice touch, the pralines at the end a great finale. The dress code is adapted to a more relaxed, no tie approach, but a suit would still be just as appropriate."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing experience at Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,"I thought I wanted to treat myself a bit on my holidays, and I couldn't be happier with my choice to do so at the Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube. Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. A treat to remember!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Traditional cuisine lacking a wow effect,"After booking a table months in advance and knowing about the reputation and accolades of this well established place - I had sky-high expectations for my meal at Schwarzwaldstube. Unfortunately, the restaurant did not live up to them. Both the interior of the newly-built place as well as the vibe of the restaurant staff were not spectacular. I got the feeling they tried to copy the ""New Nordic"" concept of reduced elegance, but instead of Scandi hipsterism added German rustiness to it, which resulted in a slightly underwhelming experience.    However, in the end, I rate a restaurant mainly on the taste of its cuisine. In this case, although most dishes were very good, none of them sparked excitement. Mostly, I was missing a bold focus on top produce: All dishes contained many different ingredients, and although they usually blended well, they lacked a clear star element on the plate that would leave a lasting memory. What's worse, some dishes clearly did not reach a 3-star level. A few examples: First, the ""two kinds of venison"" dish contained - unsurprisingly - two pieces of venison. One of them was an immaculate, tender piece that was up there with the very best venison I have ever tasted; the second one was a stringy piece that I decided not to eat after tasting the first bite. Why a 3-star chef would decide to serve both pieces instead of focusing on the better part of the meat is a mystery to me. Second, the sole was prepared in a complicated manner (using some kind of lobster sauce to stick several pieces together and then cooking it sous vide), which was explained to us in long detail. However, the only result I could taste from this process was that the sole was quite hard and less tender than how I usually know it. Finally, the ""Baba au rhum"" dessert - usually one of my absolute favorites - was a disappointment since the focus clearly did not lie on serving a perfect Baba soaked in highest-quality rum, but on all kinds of garnish around a very small piece of cake that resembled a Baba mainly in shape. It was accompanied by a bowl of inedible - as in stone-hard, deep-frozen - pieces of strawberry topped with a heavy, creamy mousse. I had to return this dish almost untouched, which got barely noticed by the staff.    I want to state again that apart from the above most dishes were indeed very good - the cheese selection and the broad range of delicious chocolates deserve an honorable mention - and we did spend a lovely night at Schwarzwaldstube. But in my view this house does clearly not play in the league of the world's best restaurants (anymore)."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Finally! We made it.,"This was our third attempt to come here, and finally we actually managed. Between the many reviews and our excitement our expectations were sky high. As you probably know the original restaurant and it’s historic building burned down and the Schwarzwaldstube reopened in the same location but in a new building just very recently. Historic coziness was replaced with a rather Scandinavian-feeling minimalism. We ordered the Grand Degustation menu. To our surprise there was a lot of dishes that mixed Asian elements with European cuisine and both of us being a couple mixed a long the same lines, think what works for us, rarely works for food. That seemed hold to hold true here too. While every dish was delicious and the quality of the ingredients were clearly very high the experience lacked wow effects for us. We still of course had a very satisfactory meal and enjoyed ourselves very much, also because of the attentive and very friendly service. We would love to come back when the menu changes and try again."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Lacking the dazzling brilliance of our previous dinner here,"The last time we dined here was in late 2019, just a couple of months before the historic bulding in which this restaurant was housed, sadly burnt down. The restaurant has only just reopened in its new permanent home, a fabulous piece of contemporary architecture that maximises the spectacular views. The interior now enjoys a double-height ceiling and has a fabulously airy and contemporary feel.    Our 2019 dinner here (see separate review) was spectacular with exceptional dish after exceptional dish; in summary our dinner here in 2022 felt far more pedestrian in comparison.    As is usually the case in 3* Michelin restaurants we took the longest tasting menu, which ones hopes, is usually the best expression of the kitchen's output and provides a journey to experience as many different dishes as possible. As my wife is pescatarian a couple of the meat dishes were thoughtfully and easily swapped for fish ones. By the end of the savoury courses, I too wished that I had gone with the pescatarian option.    The amuse bouches were pleasant enough, but there was no flash of genius that one often hopes for in a 3* Michelin restaurant. The final amuse of a salmon tartar was nice enough, but it was just a nice salmon tartar, nothing more. Then we were into the main menu, which began with a foie gras terrine which was again nice enough, and perfectly made, but there was no ""wow"" there and the fruit pairings with it were very classic. As a contrast, at L'Hotel de Ville (a 3* Michelin restaurant in Crissier) the previous weekend, they took the foie gras to a much more bitter and savoury place which was more interesting than this.    This was followed by a beautiful lobster dish which had perfectly cooked lobster with the most perfect texture and was paired with what is probably best described as the most complex and refined Thai style curry sauce. This was a lovely dish packed full of flavour and technique.    Next up was a fish dish with a perfectly cooked piece of John Dory paired with a variety of preparations of fennel and a beurre blanc sauce split with a herb oil. This was lovely cookery with the fish perfectly cooked, and the whole dish ate very well. However, this is what I'd expect in a solid 2* restaurant, there was nothing that elevated this to that 3* Michelin level.    The worst course by far was a morel and pork dish. There was a big lump of pork on the plate, which was perfectly cooked and just pink in the centre. The black truffle sauce tasted like the meat stock component was ever so slightly over reduced, and the accompanying morels didn't have much morel flavour and just tasted a bit salty. The best thing on the plate was a number of preparations of peas which had amazing flavour and brought freshness to the palate. As with the previous dish, this was 2* Michelin level cooking, but there was nothing exciting about it, in fact it was a pretty boring dish.    My wife on the other hand enjoyed some far more exciting fish dishes which were firmly in the 3* category; it is such a shame that the kitchen didn't create more interesting meat based dishes. The meat courses felt like lazy cooking; dishes which the chef had not spent much time developing. One does not expect this lack of attention to detail in a 3* Michelin restaurant.    Fortunately the dessert took a turn for the better, although for me the plating was too simple and didn't match the amazing flavours of the dishes. The most impressive dessert was a chocolate sorbet accompanied with a super light liqueur mousse and cherries such that it had the classic flavours of the black forest gateau but in a completely different format. My description does not do justice to how good this dish was. A mille-feuille of gariguette strawberries was also very impressive, but again could have been plated to better effect.    The wine list here is spectacular and full of hard to find gems so is a real treat and the wine service itself deserves a special mention as the servers were continually checking on the temperature of the white wine and putting in back on the ice as appropriate. Top marks for attention to detail here.    I would happily have shared my thoughts at the time, but no manager stopped to ask how the meal had been. Perhaps our expectations were set too high given how wonderful our last meal here was. This one just doesn't compare at any level and felt dull by comparison. Maybe we caught the kitchen on an off day, but it was incredibly disappointing to experience this dinner, albeit my wife's food was more 3* Michelin than mine. We will nevertheless try it again and hopefully the kitchen will be on better form."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Iconic - no other word,"The Schwarzwaldstube is among the iconic restaurants of Germany and indeed Europe - no other place in D has held 3 stars for as long. The current temporary venue is pretty comfortable but we await the completion of the rebuilt restaurant (the old one burned down in Jan. 2020). The meal we had there was outstanding from the amuse bouches to the mignardises - the langoustine and lobster as starters were truly world class. My main of sea bass was very good but not at the same level as the langoustine or the lobster. We chose a la carte, and the courses/portions were surprisingly generous. We thus only ordered only 2 portions of the soufflé (for 3 persons) - that was excellent as well and at the same level as a soufflé at the Hotel de Ville as few years ago.. Service was most pleasant and unrushed, the waitress even asking for the score of the Euro 2020 which was played that evening. Stéphane Gass is a world class sommelier, and we enjoyed the 2008 Josmeyer Riesling he recommended over another Riesling from F.P. Keller....... we will mot certainly return, and sooner rather than later"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the Five Best Restaurants in Europe,"We took two trains and a bus from Stuttgart and spent a night at Traube Tonbach in October 2018 just to eat at Schwarzwaldstube. It was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made.    Chef Michel is a genius and deserves high praise. While no single dish sticks out like the Lasagana at Osteria Francescana or the Caviar Eggs Benedict at Eleven Madison Park, every detail of every preparation was perfect. No needless attempts at being overly inventive - just supreme quality ingredients prepared in perfect combinations in accordance with the same local tradition that was respected by Chef Wohlfarht.    The location in the Black Forest is magical. The cheese cart is awesome. Service is extremely honest and professional. Chef walked around to greet each table towards the end of the evening - as many high-profile chefs do - but he did so in a very genuine, attentive way. Difficult to describe, but the humility of the restaurant despite its legendary status is striking.    We were fortunate to make the pilgrimage here before the fire. What a special place. We will never forget that meal."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Perfect wine pairing,The food was expectedly superb but it was the wine pairing that I loved. It was absolutely divine. It was the best in any Michelin-starred restaurants I’ve been to. I greatly appreciated the friendly service as well. It wasn’t stuffy at all. Hope to be back when the new place is up.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolutely top notch cuisine,"As a fan of more classical than ultra modern Nordic style food I had high expectations for Schwarzwaldstube. The room itself manages to mix classic Black Forest style carved wood with a contemporary neutral palette to great effect. The same traditional foundations paired with modern touches extends into the cuisine.    The wine list is extensive and offers a wonderful selection of varietals and vintages from some of the world's best producers and the markups are very modest so it is a real treat for the wine enthusiast. The service throughout the evening was extremely attentive and slick whilst remaining friendly too.    As expected the food was the perfect combination of top notch technique and the best produce. Sauces had a wonderful depth of flavour and an extra serving of each of the sauces halfway through one's dish is a really generous and most welcome touch. We had their longest tasting menu and every single dish was a joy to eat which is not always the case with these types of menu. The quality and attention to detail was absolutely consistent and the seasoning was very delicate and perfectly judged.    Compared to other restaurants operating at a similar level, Schwarzwaldstube is right at the top of the pack, and offers the perfect blend of the old and the new. We've already planned a return visit!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,An amazing experience!,"We managed to make a reservation for lunch. The dinner service was already booked when we were making our hotel reservations. The restaurant is very intimate, just a few tables, with big windows opening to the valley around us.    We decided to have the large degustation menu as we wanted to have the full experience. And what a treat it was! Everything was simply delicious. We asked for a wine pairing and the sommelier did a fantastic job too. The waiters worked very well together and the service was excellent. My husband who never eats liver was raving about the duck liver! If there is something you don’t care for, they can do swaps. But honestly, everything they serve is amazing!    The only critique I have is that they do not bring you a wine menu. We did not ask for it but still, it would be nice to know in advance what the damage would be...    We loved the restaurant and we are already making plans for returning!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Simply the best,"First and foremost is the feeling on entering this restaurant. As if your floating within the forest, peace and tranquility . All you can see from windows is natural beauty.  The waiting staff are as you would expect , with an added bonus of being personable, easy and perfectionists.  They move between each other like a fine ballet. Smooth, efficient and so very pleasant. All speaking perfect English.  The food is the best, from start to finish mind blowing . We went for the seven courses . They will happily accommodate six or mixing for personal taste. The wines are paired perfectly , outstanding in fact.  The chef made a point of going around each table at the end of the evening.  What an incredible talent.  An evening I will not forget."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Definitely worth the visit - absolutely exceptional,"My partner and i travel to Baiersbronn once a year to celebrate his birthday at our favorite restaurant in the world, Schwarzwaldstube    Truly worthy of its 3 Stars in every respect - from the beautiful and elegant decor, to the magnificent view of the forest and villages in the distance, the highly experienced and friendly team, to most importantly the exceptional food. We normally dine twice during each visit, and every single course is a treat. Congratulations to Torsten and his team for a perfect job in every respect in creating this wonderful oasis    Can not recommend highly enough - if you are a real foodie, you really need to visit this incredible restaurant soon ."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A remarkable Restaurant in every way,"Nestled in The Black Forest since 1789, Traube Tonbach is considered one of Germany's most luxurious destinations, and at Michelin 3* Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube Chef Torsten Michel continues a tradition of greatness that has yielded over 50 Michelin starred Chefs over the years.    Historically Germany’s most important Restaurant, three Michelin Stars awarded under the toque of Harald Wohlfhart whose tenure stretched from 1990 until 2017, guests visiting Baiersbronn are now treated to the talents of a man who served as Wohlfhart’s sous for over a decade, and from the moment one steps through the dining room doors it is hard to believe any aspect of the experience has ever been better.    Well appointed with an elevated view of the Black Forest, “Schwarzwald” in German, Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube resides in the heavily wooded main building but creates a light space thanks to bright whites and big windows, the show quick to begin before menus even arrive as guests are treated to bites including Beef Tartare, a refined Shrimp Chip and Mackerel brightened by Curry and Coriander.    Given the choice to order a la carte or via tasting, the latter ranging 165€ to 245€ depending on length and ingredients, it was with one Large Degustation plus a Vegetarian Menu and a glass of Wine each that dinner continued at a comfortable pace, Salmon Tartare and Red Pepper Mousse built on Couscous offered as Amuses to their respective menus with each just a hint of the artistry soon to come.    Taking no shortcuts, Bread repeatedly arriving warm and highlighted by Olive Focaccia as well as seeded Cereal Bread ready to be slathered in local Butter, course one offered tender Lobster medallions amidst saline Custard and Oysters perfumed by Lemon Grass, the harmony achieved undeniably impressive just as it was for wood-fired Artichokes that offered noteworthy variance from bite to bite depending on ratio of Black Truffle or Mustard involved.    Open to swapping items between tastings or even a la carte, it was trusting Chef Torsten that dinner continued henceforth, any preconceived notions about Beef Liver erased by a tender cut softened by Barolo and brightened by Peas while Morels offered their earthy aromatics to both this composition and the Vegetarian alternative featuring Egg Yolk cooked inside Mushroom Jelly that acted like the skin of a Ravioli.    Lightening up course three, a Filet of Red Mullet reminiscent of Guy Savoy in its use of crispy “scales” served amidst vibrant Red Pepper Coulis, it was with impressive artistry that the Vegetarian Menu one-upped its counterpart by way of tiny Tomatoes and Onions hollowed and refilled with fortified Cream atop a fresh Tomato Tart resting in Pine Nut Marinade.    Not an overly-long menu, though portions will assuredly challenge those of smaller appetites, savories concluded by way of Duck Margret and Confit alongside stacked Turnips and thin, yet intense, Sauce plus “Chef’s vision of Spring” as Green Asparagus and Young Peas forming the base to laminated Pastry ready to sop up what was described as “Beef-free Bordelaise,” though if served alongside the real deal only the most discerning might be able to detect a difference.    Proudly wheeling out a Cheese Cart, many local plus several from France offered with Bread, it was after taste buds were sent reeling by Cabri Ariégeois that the rest proved well-aged and pleasant, though the composed course of melted Chabichou and Potato Mousseline with Garlic Pistou was an enviable alternative and fantastic transitional dish to the Vegetarian Dessert offering Gariguette Strawberries in several textures atop a boozy Baba anchored by Chantilly Crème.    Equally elegant in the presentation of a Yuzu Croustillant in sour surroundings, this dish essentially a palate cleanser in preparation for Schwarzwaldstube’s reinterpreted Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, both this Dessert and its counterpart featuring Chocolate, Bananas and Lime were amongst the most complex sweets seen in Germany, each bite a little different from the last but all of them memorable and just as relevant to the whole.    Undeniably deserving of its accolades, not even one item from the collection of Mignardises lacking in terms of artistry or flavor, it was after settling the bill that guests were bid auf Wiedersehen with the lone regret being opting not to spend a night at Traube Tonbach in order to enjoy Breakfast the next morning."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A Little Bit too much SALT,"I had the Small tasting Menu with 5 courses ,  Very Imaginative courses with some Asia Twist,  such as the Raw Tuna with Soy sauce.    The dishes Beautiful but they have a little too much salt in ALL of them.    After the Told them I am on a low Salt diet, the taste turned a little milder.    Service was excellent......"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing restaurant,"Went there as a present for my Mum's 70th birthday and weren't disappointed. The service team was extremely friendly, attentive and easygoing. They even prepared the table nicely for the ""birthday girl"" although i only mentioned it once a couple of weeks ago when I made the reservation. The place is cosy and nicely decorated with a stunning view of thw black forest. The food is simply perfect, regardless of what you're eating. The pigeon was great, the cheese soft and tasty and the dessert beyond any standard. I've been to the Schwarzwaldstube before (Mr. Wolfarth's time) and I habe to say that it didn't get worse. We'll be back (after we have trained the menu away...)."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Excellent restaurant!,"We visited for lunch, and had a la carte. Perfect cooking and amazing skills shown both tehnically and flavourwise. Service was flawless, warm, welcoming. They hd great knowledge of the food and wine. Next time we come for dinner! Thanks for an amazing culinary treat."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing restaurant,Beyond my expectations my first 3 star dining experience. I can’t wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food staff and location.    The staff obviously love working where they work.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Incredible experience,"My husband and I had the pleasure of eating here during our trip to the Black Forest this year. We had the 7 course dinner with wine pairings. We can’t say enough wonderful things about the beautiful, delicious food, and the fantastic, friendly service. The wine pairings were absolutely perfect, and included a good balance of German and other European wines. We had an incredible experience overall, and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area who is looking for a fine dining experience. We would love the opportunity to visit again in the future."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A truly magical evening!,"A German friend of ours recommended this restaurant when they learned we were staying in nearby Baden-Baden for our honeymoon. We were still several weeks out and were able to get reservations for one of the nights we'd be nearby.    The restaurant did request that we re-confirm our reservations one week in advance of our visit.    Our reservations were for 7:00 PM. We were unfamiliar with the area and had a long drive (1 hour or more) so we gave ourselves plenty of time. We arrived about 30 minutes early and the dining room was not yet open.    They made us feel welcome, inviting us to sit in a comfortable and beautiful waiting area. They provided us with a choice of aperitifs and we selected two different types so we could compare. Both were delicious.    Once the restaurant was opened (a little earlier than 7:00) they invited us to our table - we were right against the window, with a beautiful view. We found they had a name card on the table. My wife had made the reservations and used her maiden name. When we told them we'd just been married as we were enjoying our aperitif, they were attentive to the name difference and made up a new name card for us, showing our new married status. That was a very nice touch!    The rest of the experience just got better with every interaction. The 3 small bites of the amuse-bouche was delightful and gave a hint of the incredible experience ahead of us.    I selected the small digestive menu and my wife the vegetarian. There were phenomenal moments in both, but I would have to say the vegetarian menu was my favorite. One plate in particular was so incredible, I jumped at the chance when they asked if I'd like one of my very own. All I can say is WOW!    To limit what could easily be a novel-length review, I will share some additional highlights that stood out.    1) The friendliness of the staff truly made you feel like you were an honored guest or some long lost family member. Rather than making you feel like they were doing you a favor by allowing you to dine with them, they made us feel special and welcome and that they truly appreciated our custom.    2) The visit by the owner stood out. He warmly welcomed us and shared some brief history of the hotel. I am always more loyal to restaurants where the owner, chef or management take the time to greet you, inquire about your experience and say thank you.    3) The staff. Each person was a true delight. I wish I knew their names so I could call them out, because they deserve the recognition. Each played their role impeccably well, with just the right amount of professionalism and personality to make the experience as wonderful as the food.    4) Lastly and most significantly was the food. WOW! I am not sure how it is possible to create such an experience in a single bite. Visual presentation, aromas, flavors, temperatures and textures combined into what I can only describe as an emotional response. I'm not sure how the chef was able to tap directly into my emotion centers but some of these flavor combinations were so incredible, I remember them not as ""taste"" but instead ""experience"" - a truly wonderful experience at that. .... I had to laugh at one point. The reaction was so strong that I closed my eyes and covered my mouth and just reveled in the great flavor. One of the gals came up to me to ask if everything was alright! :) ""Oh yes! Very right!"" was what I thought, and probably what I said. That was the single best bite of food of my life so far."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,"One of the finest restaurants in Europe, if not the world.","We are from the USA and liked this restaurant so much when we visited last May that we just returned for a second visit. Much to our surprise the Maitre’D recognized us and gave us a table on the opposite side of the room from where we sat the last time so that we could enjoy a different view. We had the vegetarian tasting menu and it was the finest we have ever had, by far. Everything was perfect. Service was knowledgeable and efficient. We are already planning our return. The Maitre’D is a good source of recommendation for other fine restaurants."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolutely fantastic!!!,"I can't say enough about the quality of food and service we received at this Michelin 3 star restaurant. The waitstaff was so thorough yet incredibly friendly - not stuffy at all.    The restaurant has 12 tables and the setting and views are lovely. We were there with our 2 teenage sons and had a lovely circular table next to the window.    And the food...what can I say - it was outstanding. We purchased a la carte, an appetizer, main and dessert and of course they bring 2 amuse bouche before the appetizer and selections from the dessert carte after your dessert. Every bite we took was phenomenal. This was the culinary highlight of our German vacation!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Excellent - worth its 3 stars,"There isn't much to add to the rest of the reviews here: it's simply excellent from start to end. The food is absolutely incredible. We had the vegetarian and regular tasting menu with wine pairing. Most of the courses were not only something we never had before, which is not an easy feat, but a perfect combination of several smaller dishes, perfectly in sync with each other. It's hard to explain: you simply have to experience it.    A special mention should go to the young sommelier that took care of us that evening. She was incredibly nice and also highly competent. We really appreciated the broad knowledge that accompanied each wine and the passion that she displayed each time.    All in all it was simply a perfect experience, there is literally nothing we would change and we look very much forward to our next visit!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,"Food, wine, service, location - perfect!","One of my best restaurant experiences ever.  The food was excellent - innovative as well as perfectly executed.  The wines were perfectly matched with the menu - and the sommelier and his staff were very knowledgeable.  Excellent service - good at adapting to the diners.  Perfect location in Schwarzwald, good view from the restaurant.  By far better than the nearby Bareiss Restaurant (also ***). We chose to stay at the Bareiss Hotel (recommended!) because they had a more appealing website - next time we'll stay at Hotel Traube Tonbach. There is a complimentary limousine service between the two hotels and their ***-restaurants."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best fine dining restaurants in the world,From the moment you walk in the food is magical from the amuse bouche to the main courses to the incredible desserts.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Very nice experience,"The setting is very nice with large windows overlooking the Black Forrest.  Ambiance inside the restaurant could be better, its a little too sterile for my taste.  The food was excellent and so was the service. We had a very enjoyable evening."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Finally the real deal!,Basic food taken to the next level! From Maultaschen über grüne Sosse to Kalbsrahmgulasch. Absolutely to die for

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Superb restaurant! Fantastic food and service.,"A great experience. Celebrated 50 years of friendship with old friend, sadly one of the trio was admitted to the hospital the day before so could not join us. The service is excellent and meticulous as one might expect from a Michelin 3 starred restaurant but the personnel were warm, friendly and made for a pleasant experience. The food is absolutely amazing. Every course in the large Degustation menu was superb, visually and of course, with incredible quality. A real taste sensation with some of the combinations and sauces. The beverage and wine offering is vast and will please anyone. The pre menu welcome bites were a nice touch, the pralines at the end a great finale. The dress code is adapted to a more relaxed, no tie approach, but a suit would still be just as appropriate."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing experience at Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,"I thought I wanted to treat myself a bit on my holidays, and I couldn't be happier with my choice to do so at the Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube. Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. A treat to remember!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Traditional cuisine lacking a wow effect,"After booking a table months in advance and knowing about the reputation and accolades of this well established place - I had sky-high expectations for my meal at Schwarzwaldstube. Unfortunately, the restaurant did not live up to them. Both the interior of the newly-built place as well as the vibe of the restaurant staff were not spectacular.

What's worse, some dishes clearly did not reach a 3-star level. A few examples: First, the ""two kinds of venison"" dish contained - unsurprisingly - two pieces of venison. One of them was an immaculate, tender piece that was up there with the very best venison I have ever tasted; the second one was a stringy piece that I decided not to eat after tasting the first bite. Why a 3-star chef would decide to serve both pieces instead of focusing on the better part of the meat is a mystery to me. Second, the sole was prepared in a complicated manner (using some kind of lobster sauce to stick several pieces together and then cooking it sous vide), which was explained to us in long detail. However, the only result I could taste from this process was that the sole was quite hard and less tender than how I usually know it. Finally, the ""Baba au rhum"" dessert - usually one of my absolute favorites - was a disappointment since the focus clearly did not lie on serving a perfect Baba soaked in highest-quality rum, but on all kinds of garnish around a very small piece of cake that resembled a Baba mainly in shape. It was accompanied by a bowl of inedible - as in stone-hard, deep-frozen - pieces of strawberry topped with a heavy, creamy mousse. I had to return this dish almost untouched, which got barely noticed by the staff.    I want to state again that apart from the above most dishes were indeed very good - the cheese selection and the broad range of delicious chocolates deserve an honorable mention - and we did spend a lovely night at Schwarzwaldstube. But in my view this house does clearly not play in the league of the world's best restaurants (anymore)."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Finally! We made it.,"This was our third attempt to come here, and finally we actually managed. Between the many reviews and our excitement our expectations were sky high. As you probably know the original restaurant and it’s historic building burned down and the Schwarzwaldstube reopened in the same location but in a new building just very recently. Historic coziness was replaced with a rather Scandinavian-feeling minimalism. We ordered the Grand Degustation menu. To our surprise there was a lot of dishes that mixed Asian elements with European cuisine and both of us being a couple mixed a long the same lines, think what works for us, rarely works for food. That seemed hold to hold true here too. While every dish was delicious and the quality of the ingredients were clearly very high the experience lacked wow effects for us. We still of course had a very satisfactory meal and enjoyed ourselves very much, also because of the attentive and very friendly service. We would love to come back when the menu changes and try again."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Lacking the dazzling brilliance of our previous dinner here,"The last time we dined here was in late 2019, just a couple of months before the historic bulding in which this restaurant was housed, sadly burnt down. The restaurant has only just reopened in its new permanent home, a fabulous piece of contemporary architecture that maximises the spectacular views. The interior now enjoys a double-height ceiling and has a fabulously airy and contemporary feel.    Our 2019 dinner here (see separate review) was spectacular with exceptional dish after exceptional dish; in summary our dinner here in 2022 felt far more pedestrian in comparison.    As is usually the case in 3* Michelin restaurants we took the longest tasting menu, which ones hopes, is usually the best expression of the kitchen's output and provides a journey to experience as many different dishes as possible. As my wife is pescatarian a couple of the meat dishes were thoughtfully and easily swapped for fish ones. By the end of the savoury courses, I too wished that I had gone with the pescatarian option.    The amuse bouches were pleasant enough, but there was no flash of genius that one often hopes for in a 3* Michelin restaurant. The final amuse of a salmon tartar was nice enough, but it was just a nice salmon tartar, nothing more. Then we were into the main menu, which began with a foie gras terrine which was again nice enough, and perfectly made, but there was no ""wow"" there and the fruit pairings with it were very classic. As a contrast, at L'Hotel de Ville (a 3* Michelin restaurant in Crissier) the previous weekend, they took the foie gras to a much more bitter and savoury place which was more interesting than this.    This was followed by a beautiful lobster dish which had perfectly cooked lobster with the most perfect texture and was paired with what is probably best described as the most complex and refined Thai style curry sauce. This was a lovely dish packed full of flavour and technique.    Next up was a fish dish with a perfectly cooked piece of John Dory paired with a variety of preparations of fennel and a beurre blanc sauce split with a herb oil. This was lovely cookery with the fish perfectly cooked, and the whole dish ate very well. However, this is what I'd expect in a solid 2* restaurant, there was nothing that elevated this to that 3* Michelin level.    The worst course by far was a morel and pork dish. There was a big lump of pork on the plate, which was perfectly cooked and just pink in the centre. The black truffle sauce tasted like the meat stock component was ever so slightly over reduced, and the accompanying morels didn't have much morel flavour and just tasted a bit salty. The best thing on the plate was a number of preparations of peas which had amazing flavour and brought freshness to the palate. As with the previous dish, this was 2* Michelin level cooking, but there was nothing exciting about it, in fact it was a pretty boring dish.    My wife on the other hand enjoyed some far more exciting fish dishes which were firmly in the 3* category; it is such a shame that the kitchen didn't create more interesting meat based dishes. The meat courses felt like lazy cooking; dishes which the chef had not spent much time developing. One does not expect this lack of attention to detail in a 3* Michelin restaurant.    Fortunately the dessert took a turn for the better, although for me the plating was too simple and didn't match the amazing flavours of the dishes. The most impressive dessert was a chocolate sorbet accompanied with a super light liqueur mousse and cherries such that it had the classic flavours of the black forest gateau but in a completely different format. My description does not do justice to how good this dish was. A mille-feuille of gariguette strawberries was also very impressive, but again could have been plated to better effect.    The wine list here is spectacular and full of hard to find gems so is a real treat and the wine service itself deserves a special mention as the servers were continually checking on the temperature of the white wine and putting in back on the ice as appropriate. Top marks for attention to detail here.    I would happily have shared my thoughts at the time, but no manager stopped to ask how the meal had been. Perhaps our expectations were set too high given how wonderful our last meal here was. This one just doesn't compare at any level and felt dull by comparison. Maybe we caught the kitchen on an off day, but it was incredibly disappointing to experience this dinner, albeit my wife's food was more 3* Michelin than mine. We will nevertheless try it again and hopefully the kitchen will be on better form."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Iconic - no other word,"The Schwarzwaldstube is among the iconic restaurants of Germany and indeed Europe - no other place in D has held 3 stars for as long. The current temporary venue is pretty comfortable but we await the completion of the rebuilt restaurant (the old one burned down in Jan. 2020). The meal we had there was outstanding from the amuse bouches to the mignardises - the langoustine and lobster as starters were truly world class. My main of sea bass was very good but not at the same level as the langoustine or the lobster. We chose a la carte, and the courses/portions were surprisingly generous. We thus only ordered only 2 portions of the soufflé (for 3 persons) - that was excellent as well and at the same level as a soufflé at the Hotel de Ville as few years ago.. Service was most pleasant and unrushed, the waitress even asking for the score of the Euro 2020 which was played that evening. Stéphane Gass is a world class sommelier, and we enjoyed the 2008 Josmeyer Riesling he recommended over another Riesling from F.P. Keller....... we will mot certainly return, and sooner rather than later"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the Five Best Restaurants in Europe,"We took two trains and a bus from Stuttgart and spent a night at Traube Tonbach in October 2018 just to eat at Schwarzwaldstube. It was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made.    Chef Michel is a genius and deserves high praise. While no single dish sticks out like the Lasagana at Osteria Francescana or the Caviar Eggs Benedict at Eleven Madison Park, every detail of every preparation was perfect. No needless attempts at being overly inventive - just supreme quality ingredients prepared in perfect combinations in accordance with the same local tradition that was respected by Chef Wohlfarht.    The location in the Black Forest is magical. The cheese cart is awesome. Service is extremely honest and professional. Chef walked around to greet each table towards the end of the evening - as many high-profile chefs do - but he did so in a very genuine, attentive way. Difficult to describe, but the humility of the restaurant despite its legendary status is striking.    We were fortunate to make the pilgrimage here before the fire. What a special place. We will never forget that meal."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Perfect wine pairing,The food was expectedly superb but it was the wine pairing that I loved. It was absolutely divine. It was the best in any Michelin-starred restaurants I’ve been to. I greatly appreciated the friendly service as well. It wasn’t stuffy at all. Hope to be back when the new place is up.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolutely top notch cuisine,"As a fan of more classical than ultra modern Nordic style food I had high expectations for Schwarzwaldstube. The room itself manages to mix classic Black Forest style carved wood with a contemporary neutral palette to great effect. The same traditional foundations paired with modern touches extends into the cuisine.    The wine list is extensive and offers a wonderful selection of varietals and vintages from some of the world's best producers and the markups are very modest so it is a real treat for the wine enthusiast. The service throughout the evening was extremely attentive and slick whilst remaining friendly too.    As expected the food was the perfect combination of top notch technique and the best produce. Sauces had a wonderful depth of flavour and an extra serving of each of the sauces halfway through one's dish is a really generous and most welcome touch. We had their longest tasting menu and every single dish was a joy to eat which is not always the case with these types of menu. The quality and attention to detail was absolutely consistent and the seasoning was very delicate and perfectly judged.    Compared to other restaurants operating at a similar level, Schwarzwaldstube is right at the top of the pack, and offers the perfect blend of the old and the new. We've already planned a return visit!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,An amazing experience!,"We managed to make a reservation for lunch. The dinner service was already booked when we were making our hotel reservations. The restaurant is very intimate, just a few tables, with big windows opening to the valley around us.    We decided to have the large degustation menu as we wanted to have the full experience. And what a treat it was! Everything was simply delicious. We asked for a wine pairing and the sommelier did a fantastic job too. The waiters worked very well together and the service was excellent. My husband who never eats liver was raving about the duck liver! If there is something you don’t care for, they can do swaps. But honestly, everything they serve is amazing!    The only critique I have is that they do not bring you a wine menu. We did not ask for it but still, it would be nice to know in advance what the damage would be...    We loved the restaurant and we are already making plans for returning!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Simply the best,"First and foremost is the feeling on entering this restaurant. As if your floating within the forest, peace and tranquility . All you can see from windows is natural beauty.  The waiting staff are as you would expect , with an added bonus of being personable, easy and perfectionists.  They move between each other like a fine ballet. Smooth, efficient and so very pleasant. All speaking perfect English.  The food is the best, from start to finish mind blowing . We went for the seven courses . They will happily accommodate six or mixing for personal taste. The wines are paired perfectly , outstanding in fact.  The chef made a point of going around each table at the end of the evening.  What an incredible talent.  An evening I will not forget."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Definitely worth the visit - absolutely exceptional,"My partner and i travel to Baiersbronn once a year to celebrate his birthday at our favorite restaurant in the world, Schwarzwaldstube    Truly worthy of its 3 Stars in every respect - from the beautiful and elegant decor, to the magnificent view of the forest and villages in the distance, the highly experienced and friendly team, to most importantly the exceptional food. We normally dine twice during each visit, and every single course is a treat. Congratulations to Torsten and his team for a perfect job in every respect in creating this wonderful oasis    Can not recommend highly enough - if you are a real foodie, you really need to visit this incredible restaurant soon ."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A remarkable Restaurant in every way,"Nestled in The Black Forest since 1789, Traube Tonbach is considered one of Germany's most luxurious destinations, and at Michelin 3* Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube Chef Torsten Michel continues a tradition of greatness that has yielded over 50 Michelin starred Chefs over the years.    Historically Germany’s most important Restaurant, three Michelin Stars awarded under the toque of Harald Wohlfhart whose tenure stretched from 1990 until 2017, guests visiting Baiersbronn are now treated to the talents of a man who served as Wohlfhart’s sous for over a decade, and from the moment one steps through the dining room doors it is hard to believe any aspect of the experience has ever been better.    Well appointed with an elevated view of the Black Forest, “Schwarzwald” in German, Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube resides in the heavily wooded main building but creates a light space thanks to bright whites and big windows, the show quick to begin before menus even arrive as guests are treated to bites including Beef Tartare, a refined Shrimp Chip and Mackerel brightened by Curry and Coriander.    Given the choice to order a la carte or via tasting, the latter ranging 165€ to 245€ depending on length and ingredients, it was with one Large Degustation plus a Vegetarian Menu and a glass of Wine each that dinner continued at a comfortable pace, Salmon Tartare and Red Pepper Mousse built on Couscous offered as Amuses to their respective menus with each just a hint of the artistry soon to come.    Taking no shortcuts, Bread repeatedly arriving warm and highlighted by Olive Focaccia as well as seeded Cereal Bread ready to be slathered in local Butter, course one offered tender Lobster medallions amidst saline Custard and Oysters perfumed by Lemon Grass, the harmony achieved undeniably impressive just as it was for wood-fired Artichokes that offered noteworthy variance from bite to bite depending on ratio of Black Truffle or Mustard involved.    Open to swapping items between tastings or even a la carte, it was trusting Chef Torsten that dinner continued henceforth, any preconceived notions about Beef Liver erased by a tender cut softened by Barolo and brightened by Peas while Morels offered their earthy aromatics to both this composition and the Vegetarian alternative featuring Egg Yolk cooked inside Mushroom Jelly that acted like the skin of a Ravioli.    Lightening up course three, a Filet of Red Mullet reminiscent of Guy Savoy in its use of crispy “scales” served amidst vibrant Red Pepper Coulis, it was with impressive artistry that the Vegetarian Menu one-upped its counterpart by way of tiny Tomatoes and Onions hollowed and refilled with fortified Cream atop a fresh Tomato Tart resting in Pine Nut Marinade.    Not an overly-long menu, though portions will assuredly challenge those of smaller appetites, savories concluded by way of Duck Margret and Confit alongside stacked Turnips and thin, yet intense, Sauce plus “Chef’s vision of Spring” as Green Asparagus and Young Peas forming the base to laminated Pastry ready to sop up what was described as “Beef-free Bordelaise,” though if served alongside the real deal only the most discerning might be able to detect a difference.    Proudly wheeling out a Cheese Cart, many local plus several from France offered with Bread, it was after taste buds were sent reeling by Cabri Ariégeois that the rest proved well-aged and pleasant, though the composed course of melted Chabichou and Potato Mousseline with Garlic Pistou was an enviable alternative and fantastic transitional dish to the Vegetarian Dessert offering Gariguette Strawberries in several textures atop a boozy Baba anchored by Chantilly Crème.    Equally elegant in the presentation of a Yuzu Croustillant in sour surroundings, this dish essentially a palate cleanser in preparation for Schwarzwaldstube’s reinterpreted Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, both this Dessert and its counterpart featuring Chocolate, Bananas and Lime were amongst the most complex sweets seen in Germany, each bite a little different from the last but all of them memorable and just as relevant to the whole.    Undeniably deserving of its accolades, not even one item from the collection of Mignardises lacking in terms of artistry or flavor, it was after settling the bill that guests were bid auf Wiedersehen with the lone regret being opting not to spend a night at Traube Tonbach in order to enjoy Breakfast the next morning."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A Little Bit too much SALT,"I had the Small tasting Menu with 5 courses ,  Very Imaginative courses with some Asia Twist,  such as the Raw Tuna with Soy sauce.    The dishes Beautiful but they have a little too much salt in ALL of them.    After the Told them I am on a low Salt diet, the taste turned a little milder.    Service was excellent......"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing restaurant,"Went there as a present for my Mum's 70th birthday and weren't disappointed. The service team was extremely friendly, attentive and easygoing. They even prepared the table nicely for the ""birthday girl"" although i only mentioned it once a couple of weeks ago when I made the reservation. The place is cosy and nicely decorated with a stunning view of thw black forest. The food is simply perfect, regardless of what you're eating. The pigeon was great, the cheese soft and tasty and the dessert beyond any standard. I've been to the Schwarzwaldstube before (Mr. Wolfarth's time) and I habe to say that it didn't get worse. We'll be back (after we have trained the menu away...)."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Excellent restaurant!,"We visited for lunch, and had a la carte. Perfect cooking and amazing skills shown both tehnically and flavourwise. Service was flawless, warm, welcoming. They hd great knowledge of the food and wine. Next time we come for dinner! Thanks for an amazing culinary treat."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing restaurant,Beyond my expectations my first 3 star dining experience. I can’t wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food staff and location.    The staff obviously love working where they work.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Incredible experience,"My husband and I had the pleasure of eating here during our trip to the Black Forest this year. We had the 7 course dinner with wine pairings. We can’t say enough wonderful things about the beautiful, delicious food, and the fantastic, friendly service. The wine pairings were absolutely perfect, and included a good balance of German and other European wines. We had an incredible experience overall, and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area who is looking for a fine dining experience. We would love the opportunity to visit again in the future."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A truly magical evening!,"A German friend of ours recommended this restaurant when they learned we were staying in nearby Baden-Baden for our honeymoon. We were still several weeks out and were able to get reservations for one of the nights we'd be nearby.    The restaurant did request that we re-confirm our reservations one week in advance of our visit.    Our reservations were for 7:00 PM. We were unfamiliar with the area and had a long drive (1 hour or more) so we gave ourselves plenty of time. We arrived about 30 minutes early and the dining room was not yet open.    They made us feel welcome, inviting us to sit in a comfortable and beautiful waiting area. They provided us with a choice of aperitifs and we selected two different types so we could compare. Both were delicious.    Once the restaurant was opened (a little earlier than 7:00) they invited us to our table - we were right against the window, with a beautiful view. We found they had a name card on the table. My wife had made the reservations and used her maiden name. When we told them we'd just been married as we were enjoying our aperitif, they were attentive to the name difference and made up a new name card for us, showing our new married status. That was a very nice touch!    The rest of the experience just got better with every interaction. The 3 small bites of the amuse-bouche was delightful and gave a hint of the incredible experience ahead of us.    I selected the small digestive menu and my wife the vegetarian. There were phenomenal moments in both, but I would have to say the vegetarian menu was my favorite. One plate in particular was so incredible, I jumped at the chance when they asked if I'd like one of my very own. All I can say is WOW!    To limit what could easily be a novel-length review, I will share some additional highlights that stood out.    1) The friendliness of the staff truly made you feel like you were an honored guest or some long lost family member. Rather than making you feel like they were doing you a favor by allowing you to dine with them, they made us feel special and welcome and that they truly appreciated our custom.    2) The visit by the owner stood out. He warmly welcomed us and shared some brief history of the hotel. I am always more loyal to restaurants where the owner, chef or management take the time to greet you, inquire about your experience and say thank you.    3) The staff. Each person was a true delight. I wish I knew their names so I could call them out, because they deserve the recognition. Each played their role impeccably well, with just the right amount of professionalism and personality to make the experience as wonderful as the food.    4) Lastly and most significantly was the food. WOW! I am not sure how it is possible to create such an experience in a single bite. Visual presentation, aromas, flavors, temperatures and textures combined into what I can only describe as an emotional response. I'm not sure how the chef was able to tap directly into my emotion centers but some of these flavor combinations were so incredible, I remember them not as ""taste"" but instead ""experience"" - a truly wonderful experience at that. .... I had to laugh at one point. The reaction was so strong that I closed my eyes and covered my mouth and just reveled in the great flavor. One of the gals came up to me to ask if everything was alright! :) ""Oh yes! Very right!"" was what I thought, and probably what I said. That was the single best bite of food of my life so far."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,"One of the finest restaurants in Europe, if not the world.","We are from the USA and liked this restaurant so much when we visited last May that we just returned for a second visit. Much to our surprise the Maitre’D recognized us and gave us a table on the opposite side of the room from where we sat the last time so that we could enjoy a different view. We had the vegetarian tasting menu and it was the finest we have ever had, by far. Everything was perfect. Service was knowledgeable and efficient. We are already planning our return. The Maitre’D is a good source of recommendation for other fine restaurants."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolutely fantastic!!!,"I can't say enough about the quality of food and service we received at this Michelin 3 star restaurant. The waitstaff was so thorough yet incredibly friendly - not stuffy at all.    The restaurant has 12 tables and the setting and views are lovely. We were there with our 2 teenage sons and had a lovely circular table next to the window.    And the food...what can I say - it was outstanding. We purchased a la carte, an appetizer, main and dessert and of course they bring 2 amuse bouche before the appetizer and selections from the dessert carte after your dessert. Every bite we took was phenomenal. This was the culinary highlight of our German vacation!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Excellent - worth its 3 stars,"There isn't much to add to the rest of the reviews here: it's simply excellent from start to end. The food is absolutely incredible. We had the vegetarian and regular tasting menu with wine pairing. Most of the courses were not only something we never had before, which is not an easy feat, but a perfect combination of several smaller dishes, perfectly in sync with each other. It's hard to explain: you simply have to experience it.    A special mention should go to the young sommelier that took care of us that evening. She was incredibly nice and also highly competent. We really appreciated the broad knowledge that accompanied each wine and the passion that she displayed each time.    All in all it was simply a perfect experience, there is literally nothing we would change and we look very much forward to our next visit!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,"Food, wine, service, location - perfect!","One of my best restaurant experiences ever.  The food was excellent - innovative as well as perfectly executed.  The wines were perfectly matched with the menu - and the sommelier and his staff were very knowledgeable.  Excellent service - good at adapting to the diners.  Perfect location in Schwarzwald, good view from the restaurant.  By far better than the nearby Bareiss Restaurant (also ***). We chose to stay at the Bareiss Hotel (recommended!) because they had a more appealing website - next time we'll stay at Hotel Traube Tonbach. There is a complimentary limousine service between the two hotels and their ***-restaurants."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best fine dining restaurants in the world,From the moment you walk in the food is magical from the amuse bouche to the main courses to the incredible desserts.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Very nice experience,"The setting is very nice with large windows overlooking the Black Forrest.  Ambiance inside the restaurant could be better, its a little too sterile for my taste.  The food was excellent and so was the service. We had a very enjoyable evening."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Finally the real deal!,Basic food taken to the next level! From Maultaschen über grüne Sosse to Kalbsrahmgulasch. Absolutely to die for

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Black Forest romance Dinner!,"With my wife we were lucky to dine at some of the most distinctive and finest Michelin star rated restaurants in Europe. Needless to say that we were anxious to visit this place as well. After all Harald Wohlfahrt is the most often Michelin 3 star decorated chef in Germany even though his second Torsten Michel succeeded him by now.    The result is simply “delicious” in every sense of the word. This restaurant greets you warmly with a cozy atmosphere. Nicely fitted in a Black Forest decoration the restaurant is small and very charming.    From a service level perspective, being in Germany you would normally expect a heavily disciplined army of waiters and sommelier where everything looks orchestrated almost artificially to a level of perfection and where you would still feel some cold distance. Well the result is completely different : still a superb perfection is being achieved but thanks to a young team of waiters, sommelier and maître d’hôtel that make you feel very welcome but all of this still with a level of great discipline and warmth in the service.    It is almost as if you would be invited to a select dinner event by a family member who has not seen you in years and who is willing to go out its way to make you feel comfortable and to impress you in every single aspect of being a host. Around 10pm the kids club closed and we were even invited to take the boys to our table without any kind of disturbing look or impression. It is worth noting this that families are simply welcome here as well.    From a food perspective, I am still looking for the mistake or hiccup but simply cannot find it. All scents and flavors are nicely combined to strike a delicate balance that eventually triggers a fabulous explosion in your mouth.    It is certainly not the most innovative cuisine we have tasted yet (but we did not come to this place for that!) but it is as far as I can recollect the best dishes we ever tried!!!    I will intentionally not comment on any particular dish but will simply say that if you go for the langoustine, the lotte or the lobster, you will seal your own doom of having to go back there time and time again as your palette will firmly remind you on a regular basis of what a fantastic experience this has been.    Prices are very high, but this comes to no surprise in such a fine restaurant. The wine list is superb and prices slightly below my expectations for such a fine dining place.    Call us old school, but what we also like is that you are also greeted by the owner or the chef himself and in this place the owner Heinrich Finkbeiner himself comes to your table, presents himself and engages in a short but very honest discussion with you simply aiming at making you feel almost home!!!    We will certainly come back to this place, very hungry for more..."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A dream come true,"Pure bliss and delight! We celebrated a very special moment there and couldn’t have chosen a better place. The team around the new chef Michel is excellent, their delivery outstanding - from the first moment you enter to the moment you leave. Paradise on earth.    We had the ‘small’ degustations menu. Absolutely recommend. On top we chose the accompanying wines and had the pleasure of the sommelier explaining every new glass he served. The service is highly competent and friendly. You feel welcome and not stiff at all.    This is a place for your bucket list."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Wow!,"If you are fortunate to get a reservation at this fantastic restaurant you will be in for a real experience.Like the hotel,this restaurant could not be better.The staff works very hard to make the evening perfect.Amazing food & wonderful wine selection at varying price points.The ""Christmas Ornament"" desert made me wish I brought my camera.The chef & owner visit every table.What a treat!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Spectacular!,"Our evening was perfect, start to finish. The dining room is stunning. The staff are welcoming and pleasant. The food was absolutely delicious. The wine and wine service was lovely. We had a wonderful, fun time and enjoyed every bite."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,The absolute pinnacle of fine dining,"The Black Forest has always been known for scenic beauty and heartfelt hospitality. You're not greeted with hello, but rather with: Gruess Gott. That already gives you a warm feeling. The restaurant exudes an air of elegance and yet sturdiness in keeping with the surroundings. The service is professional, knowledgeable and unhurried, that includes the sommelier service, the wines were wonderful parings. The stand-out course for me was the seared foie gras, but I hasten to add that the entire meal was a highly sensual experience. Mr. Wohlfahrt certainly deserves the three stars as well as 18th place on La Liste. I am attaching a copy of the menu as well as the maximum allowable pictures."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Perfect in all respects,We had an exceptional meal and visit at this wonderful restaurant. The tasting menu was exceptional and the maitre d' let us choose and replace absolutely everything we wanted. The turbot in seaweed salt is a must. Every dish was outstanding. Service was consistently pleasant and helpful and the owner came very graciously to greet us at the beginning of our meal. The design of the room is traditional with a beautiful view of the forest. Overall a very memorable and wonderful experience.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Good food...nice setting,Good food...nice setting...not far from the Bareiss...give it a try while in the area...nice environment.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Uskomaton,"**** Stars one of the best meals and menu i have ever taste,desserts were unbelievebull ,wines selection and very nice and smooth service  i recommed ,from my full heart ,the atmosphere is so nice and how they put all portions outlook,taste and local dishes are very good on the menu"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,3 star food without the breathless fussiness,"My title says it all. Excellent, thoughtful, good advice for meal and wine pairing, but ultimately the choices are left to the customer, completely without stuffy judgment."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,traditional and comfortable,"if you like your 3 star Michelin restaurants to provide traditional style food , this restaurant works well. It doesn't have the excitement in the food that others provide, but everything is prepared and presented at the highest quality. Its much more casual and relaxed than many places and perhaps risks not feeling extra special."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best anywhere,"We came to Baiersbronn especially for this restaurant and we were not disappointed. They have a large and small price fixe option as well as a la carte. We opted for the large which was 7 course with wine pairing. Spectacular! Each course was a show stopper and the service was first class. The wait staff were very friendly and both the owner and the chef came out to greet the guests. There were several additional courses that they added along the way, making this an event meal. Highly recommend coming here while you are here in the Black Forest."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Simply the best! Unforgettable!,"we had a stay at the Bareiss and tried the ""Schwarzwaldstube"". A true Michlin-3-star restaurant.  We tried the large and short menu, added / changed some of the meals and were highly impressed. The taste of the food, the optical presentation and the professionality of the entire staff were unmatched. A some sort of slim, but very clever assorted wine list fitted perfectly to the menu offerings.  We never dined that good in ""ole Germany"". Our finish was rounded up by a personal visit at our table of ""chef"" Harald.  Simply unforgettable!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Classic gourmet dinner,"We stayed two nights at the Traube Tonbach hotel and on the second night we had dinner at their three star Schwarzwaldstube in the building opposite. We had a five course dinner which was very good, but very traditional. We were not over-impressed by the staff. We entered the restaurant at 20h00 na d had a prédinner drink. One waitress approached our tabel with assorted breads but noticed there were no side plates on the table. She walked away and did not come back to put side plates on the table. After half an hour, at 21h00, I asked her if we could get any bread and all she asked me was: Oh, are you hungry? I found this a bit odd in a restaurant with three Michelin stars. We noticed that the maitre was paying attention to all regular guests during the whole evening whilst we only granted a nodd. We found the ambiance typical Schwarzwald. It is also a pity that there is no toilet on the same floor as the restaurant. Disabled people have to go to the toilet in the hotel opposite the street."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,wonderful,"We have been to the 3 star Michelin restaurant here twice before and know it to be fantastic. This time we wanted to go to the Stube as we were just passing through to Metzingen. The setting, atmosphere, service, attention to detail was perfection - like a Michelin starred restaurant. The food was delicious and high end. We had the four course taster menu and then had coffee and an extremely large slice of the black forest gateau from the coffee shop.....mmmmm (we shared one piece).  Loved it so much we have booked to take the parents back in July this year. We just want to share the experience at an affordable price. We only do the 3 star Michelin meals for our wedding anniversary once per year. Enjoy this place - a hidden gem in paradise."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Truly one of the best,"Let me just say, whether you believe in the quality of Guide Michelin or Gault Millaut, there is a reason why Chef Wohlfahrt is the longest standing chef with a continuous 3 star rating.  I won't go into the details of the menu, as it changes quite frequently, but from what we experienced I can say that I am convinced that whatever will be on the menu will be perfect. The service was impeccable and absolutely friendly. The choices made by the sommelier for each course of the dinner have been perfect. Pricey, yes it is, but worth every penny."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,The best of the best,"(The wife and) I have been to a number of great restaurants with all possible numbers of coques, stars and points. But this one is the best of them all, by a mile. The level of delightful perfection achieved by Harald Wohlfahrt and his team is literally incredible. Every time we come here we are blown away by the atmosphere, the wonderful service team and, most of all, the sensational food. Craftsmanship, creativity, imagination served with a nice touch of Southern German understatement make for an unbeatable combination."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,excellent allways .we at,we liked everything.we were there 4 times and every time it is an amazing experience.The food quality presentation and the outstanding service.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolute highlight in my culinary life,"Today was the absolute highlight in my culinary life. I had lunch at the fabulous restaurant “Schwarzwald Stube”, headed by Harald Wohlfahrt, one of Germany’s 3-Michelin-Star chefs. We went for the great 7 course meal which kept us entertained for about 4.5 hours. Following an amuse bouche, we started with tartar and mousse of mildly smoked sturgeon with imperial caviar and oyster vinaigrette. A glass of a white burgundy accompanying it was surprising in that it had the honey bouquet of a sweet desert sautern but was ultra-dry on the tongue with fruity, mineral notes.    A fried goose liver with artichokes and a caper pesto on balsamico glace formed the second course. I’m not commenting on quality – everything with no exception at all was just fabulous – fantastic material, creatively combined, cooked to the point. The service was also flawless, with a special price to be awarded to the sommelier whose recommendations where always right. The goose liver was accompanied by another white burgundy, this time with pronounced notes of oak.    The third course – scallops with a truffles from the Perigord – was especially nice because it was combined with a local speciality, Topinambur roots, their earthy, moldy :-) taste perfectly complementing the truffle. The main course, a potpourri of lamb with fennel compote and a mild garlic jus underpinned again Wohlfahrt’s dedication to flawless ingredients combined with uncompromising craftsmanship.    Although already slightly overwhelmed by what we had so far and time approaching 3 o’clock (we had started at noon), the cheese cart selection easily managed to revive our excitement. My memory being as bad as it is, I can only recall an ash-covered creamy goat cheese and a perfectly semi-liquid brie, but all six specimens on my cheese table where equally sensational. For both the lamb as well as the cheese we went for a Rioja, which was smooth with a well-balanced rich full body.    The first of the two concluding deserts consisted of a warm lemon biscuit on rhubarb compote, with a ginger lime sorbet served in a separate glass. The latter combination of tastes is one of my eternal favorites which I try to get where ever I can. The sommelier recommended a 1992 Riesling Beerenauslese for desert, which have lost a lot of its initial intense sweetness over the years and was now just incredible, with a wonderful acidity over fruit and honey notes.    The last course served its purpose of completely equilibrating our taste buds. A simply surprising apple-cilantro sorbet was set on a bed of mango and hibiscus juice, with a crunchy eucalyptus oblate on top.    So, it was simply astounding. We would have preferred to go there for dinner, but you need to book a dinner table up to a year in advance, depending on when you want to go (I guess, Saturday evening is the hardest). However, if you consider visiting Harald Wohlfahrt’s Schwarzwald Stube, just book a table – it will be an unforgettable event, no matter how long you wait for the evening to arrive.    Since this first experience in 2008 I had the please to dine on three other evenings in the Schwarzwaldstube, the last time in 2014. All evenings where superb."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best meals I've ever had ...,"We were very fortunate to be staying at Traube Tronbach when another guest cancelled & we were given the table. The waiters were charming & amusing. They explained each dish for each course (averaging 3 dishes per course). The wine pairings were excellent. I had never before had a menu in which I enjoyed every course. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish everything; there was just to much food. Arguably (and my family did discuss this at length), this was one of the finest meals we're ever had."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,One of the best experiences,We stayed overnight and had dinner and breakfast. This was one of the best experiences ever. They absolutely deserve their 3 star Michelin rating. Everything was absolutely perfect. Planning on returning soon!

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,It is always an amazing time.,"Das war ein wunderbarer Abend,mit feinstem Essen,im großartigem Ambiente. top freundlicher Service und passender Weinbegleitung.  Besser geht es nicht.    It was a a wonderful evening,the food you only need to experience it, words can't describe it enough. Ambience and the wine ,and the service made the evening worth the drive."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Going from strength to strength,"We first dined here relatively soon after the passing of the original chef patron and Clemens and his brigade were offering more or the less the same wonderful cuisine. Fast forward to today, and the late chef's influence and ethos is apparent in every single dish, however, one can now really see Clemens' own style in the dishes.    The menu today still incorporates the best classical techniques combined with the very finest produce, but has a little bit of a lighter feel to it overall. There are also a few ""Walhotel Sonnora classics"" that are still on the menu which adds to its timeless appeal.    The flavours, and balance that are apparent in every dish, is very impressive. This is especially true for the sauces, which combine all of the elements that the very finest sauces should, giving them so much complexity that they are amongst the best sauces in any 3 star restaurant we have ever dined at.    It was a real joy to sample the latest creations from the kitchen accompanied by wines from their wonderful cellar; we can't wait to return again. Waldhotel Sonnora is definitely in our top 3, 3 star restaurants worldwide and it is so pleasing to see it going from strength to strength; truly the definition of a hidden (well, relatively) gem!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Excellent,"No wishes stay umfulfilled here. Excellent kitchen- team, excellent service, excellent sommelier. I would anytime come back. The value for money is excellent considering the amount of staff and the efforts made. (For orientation: 2 big menus with extra signature dish and wine pairing, champagne as aperitif, good digestive, double room incl. breakfast ca EUR 1300)"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Absolutely stellar cuisine,"As it turned out, our last dinner here was our final 3* Michelin experience before the pandemic hit in early 2020, so it was with much anticipation that we were to find out if the refurbishment had changed things. Any apprehension that the restaurant might have lost its warm atmosphere or charm was totally unfounded and things were better than ever before.    The dinner here marked the end of a foodie trip through Germany and Switzerland with Schwarzwaldstube and L'Hotel de Ville representing the other 3* dinners, so Waldhotel Sonnora had some pretty strong competition (definitely in the case of the latter and less so for the former).    As usual, we took the tasting menu which includes both some classic as well as new dishes, and tonight was no exception. The amuse bouches here are really miniature dishes in their own right rather than just being ""something"" served on a cracker as is the case in many starred establishments; they were as wonderful as ever.    The classic ""gateau"" of beef tartar, potato rosti topped with a very generous layer of caviar was as delicous as it ever was. One of the standout new dishes was turbot served with tomato and watermelon which sounds a little questionable on paper, but on the plate ate exceptionally well with just the right levels of sweetness and perfect balance. This was absolutely top notch cooking. A spring lamb dish served with no less than three different sauces was divine too.    The pastry section here has gone from strength to strength. It was our 3rd strawberry based dessert in a 3* restaurant this week, so we were a little sceptical, but the kitchen here presented the best one. It had a multitude of textures, and nutty, almost savoury elements that gave it real interest and originality. The accompanying muscat sabyon really worked well with it too.    Finally there was a wide variety of petit fours, including a parfait, beignets as well as lots of chocolates and miniature tarts. All of them were perfectly made and rounded off this generous dinner well.    There are some new members of the front of house team alongside more familiar faces and they all worked in perfect harmony to achieve a friendly yet slick service.    The kitchen here is cooking better than ever and truly offers some of the best cooking that you can find anywhere in the world yet bizarrely this restaurant is still relatively under the radar. Highly recommended."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Divine as ever,"This was our third dinner here and each and every time there are new dishes to discover so there is never remotely any sense of repetition, even though the cuisine is so wonderful here we wouldn't mind eating the same meal a thousand times over!    The dining room is very well lit which after recent experiences in New York - where you need to use the torch on your phone to read a menu - is a very welcome and refreshing change. Indeed, I find the somewhat dated decor really rather charming in a comforting sort of way.    The food was as delicious as always and it was nice to see the evolution and ever so subtle tweaks here and there such as slightly lighter and less sweet friandises. The type of cuisine served here is unapologetically classical and all the better for it - the quality of the raw ingredients is top notch and the skill in preparing them is stellar.    Waldhotel is in my top five 3* Michelin restaurants worldwide and is somewhere that I'll continue to return to time and time again... indeed we've already booked again for the start of the summer!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,40,"Traditional 3-star cuisine, slight changes with the new chef","The last visit was 4 years ago, and the menu looks quite similar. Prices have gone up by 20%, as everywhere.  Last time I was impressed by the fact that they did not use any Asian twist or seasoning and still did a perfect and creative job. This has changed a bit - but the food is still 3-star level. The only criticism for us was the order of dishes- we would have put the rather mild turbot before the sweetbread, not after. Also it was the weakest course. Waiting times got quite long during the course of the evening as well.  That‘s why I put 4 this time: still top notch, but not (yet) the perfection Thieltges delivered."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,still going strong,"This was the third time I visited Sonnora with family, but the first time under the tenure of Clemens Rambichler as head chef, after the untimely death of Helmut Thieltges in 2017. It was good to see that the kitchen has kept up the standard. My daughter and i took the menu this time, rather than choosing a la carte. The beef tatar with caviar and potato roesti was wonderful, and the second starter with lobster excellent. By comparison, the two main courses - sole and venison - were very good but not outstanding. My parents ate a la carte - my mother noted that the the turbot main course could have done with some more seasoning... on balance, when we return next time, we will go for a la carte choices. We drank a quite intriguing while Mosel wine - Fio . Took quite a while to appreciate...."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Fabulous cuisine,This was another wonderful dinner which showcased the best of classical French cookery with stunningly well made sauces and all round on point cookery.    The environment is very relaxed and the service friendly and efficient. If you want to enjoy a wonderful dinner that is largely classical in style albeit with a few subtle twists here and there at a price point where an entire tasting menu here is more economical than a single first course in some 3* establishments in Paris then it is more than worth making the journey here; we can't wait to return!

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Perfect :))),"Situated in a quiet location close to a small village.    Decoration and ambiance are ""classical/vintage"".    Welcome and staff are perfect. They take real care of their clients without being invasive. Trust the sommelier who introduces you to unknown treasures of German wine producers.    Delicious food and surprising wine list are perfect.    The signature dish I like best is kind of ""tarte"" as appetizer ""Torte von rohem Rindstartar auf Rösti mit Sauerrahm und Kaviar"" (potatoe-rösti with minced raw beef & sourcream topped with caviar). Soooo good and you won't forget the taste of this delicious dish...    Price&quality ratio is okay.    The restaurant belongs to the Waldhotel Sonnora... a good idea would be to book a room and stay for the delicious breakfast!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Wonderful classical cuisine,"Three Michelin stars represent ""exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey"" and there couldn't be any more apt a description for this restaurant.    Whilst the style of the decor of both the hotel and restaurant could never be accused of being cutting edge, it has been so well maintained over the years that it still looks very fresh.    The food was simply beautiful. Lots of ultra classical cooking techniques involving exceptional deeply flavoured sauces that have taken a long time to prepare. The Pomerol sauce accompanying a Dover sole was exquisite; sauces do not get better than this! All of the dishes were superb and the seasoning was always spot on; often at this level the seasoning can be verging on the side of slightly too much, but here it was absolutely on point.    The whole meal felt very generous with plenty of amuse bouches and friandises. Even the cup of tea or coffee is served with a mini slice of a gateau opera. The wine list is very extensive and offers a wide selection of regional as well as international wines - excellent vintages from top producers at pleasingly low markups which is a real treat in this day and age!    The service was extremely attentive and it was also very friendly too with none of the starchiness or indifference that one can sometimes encounter. There are very few restaurants serving this style of cuisine at this level and this absolutely ranks amongst the very best... Ignore some of the trendy restaurants appearing on the World's 50 Best list. Having been to quite a few of the top ranking ones, for me they simply don't compare to the quality and enjoyment that Waldhotel Sonnora offers. I can't recommend it highly enough and have already booked a return visit!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,very competitive with the other michelin 3 stars in europe,"my wife and I have eaten at 40-50 of the Michelin 3 stars in Europe over the years.....this is very competitive with the best of them...had the 210 euro menu..…..would love to go back......beauty and imagination in the presentations and decent portion sizes...….very good service....as expected, a very good and very pricey wine list.....the 4 of us had a good reisling but a so-so pouilly-fume and spatburgunder among the lower priced wines our budget would allow.....overall, a memorable dinner"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,the Best of the Best,"Second time under the new young chef and again it was a perfect night out for my wife and me. we had the full tasting menu and YES it is french and you will be very full in the end but you will be also absolutely happy. from the foie gra , to the beef tartar with imperial caviar, to the lobster, sol and deer ..... every dish was sensational and a taste explosion. that restaurant is the opposite of TRENDY - it is classic, old fashioned and this in the best way because everything is taste driven. don't get me wrong the food looks great but the optic is secondary - it is all about how good the dishes taste and fit together. i wrote it last year allready but need to repeat it again> . the best lobster dish in the world is in that lonely spot in the middle of the hunsrueck - where no ocean is close. the cheese selection and desserts - everything is a 10 out of 10. i went to over 100 michelin star restaurants around the globe and this restaurant is my favorite. if you eat at Sonora you think the French Laundry is a 1 star."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Absolute perfection,"If you have the resources and opportunity to eat at Sonnora, do so. It was sheer perfection, from beginning to end. Yes, this kind of fine dining has a price, but it was worth every cent.    And to anyone who may feel intimidated to eat in a three Michelin star restaurant, I can assure you that any little flubs you make are handled discreetly. If you drop your fork, there is a new one on your table without anyone noticing you messed up.    I would not necessarily recommend staying at the hotel, but the restaurant and everything about it was a once-in-a-lifetime event for us."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Fabulous,"I'm eternally grateful to have eaten at this restaurant shortly before the owner passed away. Not that they haven't moved forward successfully, but it was a special evening and I'm glad I got to experience his vision. In point of fact, this was a tremendous meal, practically a perfect three-star experience from start to finish. Had the full tasting meal with wine pairings and there isn't a single criticism I can offer. I only wish other three-stars were as committed to the standards of excellence and attention to detail as provided by Waldhaus Sonnora. Best wishes to them going forward."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,classic ....french inspired..... perfect....,"the 3 michelin stars are well deserved ....now where the chef recently died the young sous chef had to take over the kitchen and delivered the tasting menu perfectly .... every dish had a wow effect ...starting just with the bread and homemade butter.... lobster (the best one i ever had), turbot, quail, venison...  classic ... old fashioned ... in a old fashioned hotel in the middle of a forrest in the wine region MOSEL in the hunsrueck .... this is only one of 8 german 3 star michelin and so far my favorite of them ....worth a trip... the night in the hotel is only 150 euro incl. breakfast for 2 ...food is 200 euro per person plus wine .... i have to say most of the 2 stars i went didnt delivered - felt mostly flat ....but 3 stars allways deliver in a major way .... a lot of 1 star recently were better as the 2 stars"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Top class in difficult times,"It must have been so tough for the owner and her staff, running a service like this only days after the iconic chef of this restaurant had passed away. Any criticism really would be out of place - and who cares anyway when it's a bit too warm inside and the waiting time between the courses is just a tiny bit away from uncomfortable. What truly matters is the cuisine and the new chef / former sous chef certainly proved he can maintain the top quality of the dishes. This is a classic restaurant, with impeccable, slightly formal service - which our German table partner by the way explicitly liked (""nowadays it's more and more rare to see serving staff that still knows how it's properly done""). The 6 excellent courses were all delivered without a flaw, doing justice to the often expensive and carefully chosen ingredients. To me, the difference between two and three stars always has been that a 3-star menu actually tells you a consistent, story throughout the evening. Maybe such a story is not completely apparent at Sonnora, but in a way carefully delivering top quality at every step of the way is a story in itself. Good luck to the new chef, who probably has an impossible task of keeping 3 stars (it would not pay respect to the former chef, who founded this cuisine), but hopefully manages to maintain 2 and can then build out his own style from there."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Simply superb,"Took my wife for special dinner and the place definitely delivered! We ate the full menu, the service was exceptionally good and the food was delicius. Wine list looks good, we trusted sommeliers selections which were great. The portions are generous so after the menu you are definitely not hungry. After some four hours of tasting, the bill landed around 600 eur for 2 persons so we have to save a while before coming again. We sure would like to visit again!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Sublime,My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here and to cross dining at Michelin starred restaurant off our bucket list. We decided on the 7 course set menu and each course was better than the last. The amuse bouche of the sashimi tuna was followed by canard pâté tortellini in veal broth and then a scallop carpaccio. Risotto with sweetbreads and lobster in a lime-ginger vinaigrette were presented before an exceptionally succulent rack of lamb. The calvados whipped cream on a crispy apple tart was one of the many desserts that rounded out the dinner. The service was exceptional. The entire experience was simply sublime.

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Lifetime Memorable Dining Experience,"This restaurant is definitely worth adding it to your itinerary as a destination. GPS takes you right there even though it's off the beaten path. Plan to stay at the hotel, which is very nice. Dinner is a wonderful experience so you don't need anything else to do. Every dish was wonderful. Duck specially was excellent. I still remember the rosemary and tyme dinner rolls. So good. Hostess was delightful and serving staff was very professional. A lifetime experience, worth the price."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,40,The best Kalbsbries (Ris de Veau)!,"The atmosphere in Sonnora was not the typically atmosphere in a Michelin-Star restaurant, it was a lot more relaxed. That is not meant in a negative way. The crew was very nice and fullfilled the expectations.  We had the Gourmet Menu: the Food was great. Sonnora still does Classic Cuisine and it stills taste amazing. The Kalbsbries (Ris de Veau) was amazing. Without any doubt the best that I ever tasted.    The only negative Point is the wine list. For a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant is the wine list too poor. It was the worst wine list from a Michelin Star Restaurant that we have been.    Because of the wine list I decided to give ""only"" 4 Stars."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Perfect restaurant,"Lovely rooms, friendly staff, especially the hostess. The food is to die for and the winepairings excellent. Will return soon again! Best dish was the sweetbreads with trufflesauce"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Unbelievable dining experience. Vegetarian special menu!,"We were mortified when my boss (who is german) made my husband and I a reservation at this 3 Michelin star restaurant. Why? Because we're VEGETARIANS and that is often frowned upon by the chef-world. But not this chef and not this restaurant. They made us feel perfectly NORMAL and the dishes that came out were perfection. Honestly, I cannot remember a better meal since Suzanne Goin's Lucques in Los Angeles (our favorite restaurant back home.) This is worth the expense in every way...service, wine list, location, etc.. etc.. The entire hotel and dining room could use a bit of an update, however. It's caught in the 1970's Grandmother's house and kind of stuffy. But who cares when you're eating and drinking at this level. BEYOND!!!!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,"Fully justified 3-star experience, wonderful food and service!!!!","Truly at the highest levels of classic French cooking, hotel Sonnora is a small/medium-sized family run hotel in beautiful surroundings in the Mosel valley, about one hour's drive from Luxembourg.    The chef himself is legend and by tasting his creations you will find out why! We took the full tasting menu with a super selection of matching wines.    Service was top-class, very friendly, and the hotel itself was a great place to stay the night.    A special place for a special occasion."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,pure excellent!!!!,"everything here from the place,service and stuff to the food and range of wines - is just perfect!  Every time i visit mosel valley it's a must for me to have a lunch/dinner at this mouthwatering place.  And after each time I have no doubts why this restaurant is keeping its *** Michelin for more than 60 years I guess  simply try it  its worth just to plan to come to the mosel area only cause of this restaurant."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,An experience in food perfection!,"As we were in the area for some family business, we decided to try Sonnora mainly to see how a 3 Michelin star restaurant is!  It did feel a bit intimidating at the beginning, as we felt that some of the waiting staff were a bit judgmental and the atmosphere was very traditional, but once you relax you start enjoying it :-) We got the tasting menu, which does give you the best insight into the type of dishes the chef can do but I found it very filling, considering that on top of the actual menu there were also 2 complimentary dishes. What can I say about the food? It is amazing though not very experimental. But the attention to detail is utterly impressive. I can probably better appreciate it now, as I think about each dish we had, then during that evening when I was worried I won't manage to get through all of them :-)  The tasting menu had eel, lobster, mussels, oyster, foie gras, sole, venison and two desserts, all amazing. I would have liked more detail about each dish, as the descriptions given by the waiters were very short. There were lots of highlights. I especially loved the dessert with tropical fruits as it was the most complex experience, with every little bit on the plate providing interesting texture and taste. I did not like very much the small chocolate desserts at the end as I've had much better ones before. Overall, it was something really special, way beyond just food, and definitely worth the money."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Excellent tasting experience,"My first visit at Sonnora. Chose the 6 course tasting menu. Service was great, as would be expected at this level, sommelier was knowledgeable and competent, and the food was incredibly tasty - a a perfect mix of intense flavors and complexity. Highly recommended!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Utterly brilliant classic french 3* cuisine,"You just love great tasting brilliantly cooked and lovingly presented classic french cuisine? Look no further. This food is just fantastic. I really loved their food very much. The service is very good, too. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. The adjacent hotel is fairly priced although I did not particularly enjoyed the décor. But: degustibus non disputandum! You will not find culinary experiments or nouvelle cuisine here. 'Just' great tasting food. Go on, spoil yourself! You will not regret it!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Top-notch traditional Three Star,"Here, you get perfect 3-star cooking without any of the ubiquitous Asian twists like Wasabi, Japanese sauces etc. - without lacking creativity! Flavors are perfectly balanced, and the sequence of the dishes makes a great composition.  Service is attentive and flexible. We did the wine pairing, and one wine we didn't like was exchanged immediately.  Of course, for such a dinner you need to bring time and money. It takes approx. 4-5h to complete the full-blown menu, and it is 189€ without wine."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Absolutely excellent,"It was one of the best dinners in my life. During the course I had five positive surprises. First one was excellent german sekt. It may have been better than all champagnes I have tasted.    The second surprise was 'amuse bouche'. We probable ate it too fast because we don't remember what it was but the pleasure was perfect.    The third surprise was in foie gras. The protecting ""gel' was actually very tasty and made that dish extra ordinary.    The fourth surprise was in first desert. The chocolate mousse was light but full.    The last surprise was in cookies with coffee.    Everything else was just excellent.    During the evening we ordered an extra small bottle of wine and they handled it perfectly.    There was only one minor human mistake in service but it was fixed professionally. The service was the best I have seen in this type of places."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,one of the best restaurants in Europe,"British food critic Andy Hayler has repeatedly praised the cooking of Sonnora chef Helmut Thieltges as ""superb"" and and as being of utter consistency at the highest level. We largely agree - had lunch there four yeary ago and again this past Easter Sunday. This is classical French cooking using the highest quality produce available - no excursion into molecular gastromony here. If I had to compare, the meal four years ago had more of a ""wow"" factor - the nibbles were of slightly higher quality, and my Atlantic seabass main course this time was excellent but not outstanding. But it is all really a matter of taste - my wife was of the same opinion as I, but my parents were full of praise. Service is attentive, but there were the occasional slips this time - topping of the red wine was slow. The wine list is strong on German wines, and price levels are fair - we had an excellent bottle of white from the Saar region and a very good bottle of red from the Ahr region."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Classic french three star cooking,"The cooking at this german three star Michelin restaurant is classic french, and everything I had in the dinner tasting menu was perfect. The focus on the cooking is to create dishes that taste great, and which are lovely presented. Do not expect to see modern trends on your plate here. Service is fine, although there was long waits for a few of the dishes. Wine service was Ok, a few times my wine glsss was empty for some time before it was refilled, which should not happen at a three star restaurant."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,The Finese on the Moselle,"Although not directly on the Moselle, the drive from Bernkastel is at most 30 minutes, to the Wittlich suburb of Dreis. (Be sure to locate via GPS; it's not easy to find.) However, this is a restaurant one would drive hours to enjoy. Lovely atmosphere, impeccable service, menu of both local and sea specialties, and an exquisite cook. What could be more to an evening?"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,"Excellent location, staff and food","Was there over lunch for 2,5 hours with my wife. Exquisite location in the forest, very nicely build and modern house with a flaour of luxury. Reservations were made over the phone just 3 days before.  Warm welcome by 3 staff at the door. Led us to the table in a room with 3 tables. Nice and professional welcome and service by a staff of 4-5. Beverages were asked for and came without delay. The menue was handed out, and we selected the menue of the day, with changes in 1 course.  As to the wine selection, we did not ask for recommendation but we were also not offered some. So we selected a German wine which we did not like after some sips. It was exchanged to another one (French this time) without a glimps.  2 starters, and then the menue courses came, a pre-dessert and some petit four. All courses were excellently made and presented. Traditional ingredients. No real surprises though.    So, we had better meals in 3 star restaurants, but also 'worse'. Seldom a similar quality in 1 star or 2 star restaurants. There was nothing to complain about, but also nothing to be WOEed.    The price was a appropriate. Yes, we would go there again."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,20,Nothing Three Michelin Star about this place - DONT GO!,"We were excited to be heading to the Restuarant Sonnora for a truly fine dining experience.    As there is nothing much else around and we did not live in the area there was only the option to stay in the hotel. It is very much what you would expect from a country style hotel. The rooms are quaint, very German (read utalitarian) and clean.    We had room 20 which was on the top floor (warning, there is no elevator) and had a nice little balcony. Bathroom was a good size and sparkling white. I note there was no air conditioning but in spring time this was no problem and also quite common in Europe.    The main reason for coming here is for the food. It is suppossed to be Germany's second best restuarant (after Vendome - which is stunning by the way). The friends I was with (all German) consulted the chef to confirm the degustation menu including informing him of dietary requirements which for me is no lamb and no foie gras (moral objection as sadly I like the taste!!).    Service was done quite well by the young staff who were warmly engaging. The somellier is extremley young and frankly made some mistakes in her wine matching selection.    The food is good but NOT three Michelin star quality. At best it is two stars. Some of the servings and food was unispiring and frankly looked sloppy on the plate.    The worst part for me was on my main course there was foie gras. When I complained they denied all knowledge of my requirement and though it only applied to the entree. The chef's wife literally shrugged her shoulders and said ""what do you want me to do?"". The chef denied there was any issue and that it was essentially our problem.    There was no offer of any compensation and the arrogance that eminated from the chef was awful.    I suspect his reputation is so strong that he almost doesn't have to care as people keep flocking back. That said the restaurant was not full on a Saturday night.    After the attitude of the chef, the disappointing food and the ""couldn't care less"" attitude I see nothing redeeming about this place and would suggest avoiding it unles syou would be happy with something that is well below the touted three Michelin stars."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,"Great food, service and ambiance","We went here for a celebration with eight people and had to reserve months in advance. The night started with a glass of champagne in a cosy lounge area before we were taken to our table to start a culinary journey. From monkfish, mussel soup and lobster salad to the best lamb I have ever had in my life, the food was fantastic. Both wines that we had selected were also excellent.  The restaurant had no problems accommodating my wife's dietary requirements (no shellfish) and she received equally great dishes instead.    As is sometimes the case with such great dinners, the food just keeps on coming and it becomes more difficult to continue eating! Sound advice: do not eat too much of the delicious bread that they serve!    Would definitely recommend this restaurant as a great place for a celebratory dinner!"

His creations are unique and visionary. After a stressful and successful year this is the reward that motivates you for the next year.  We just ordered a la carte, 2 appetizers - frog legs and than variation of lobster, as main the rack of row deer and an incredible desert. Just amazing.  Just excellent."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Simply magnificent.,"This was simply a stunning meal. We selected the 5 course chefs selection, avoiding the 7 course. This proved sound judgement: as suspected there were extra courses - three. One of party needed to change two courses due to dietary reasons - the chages were readily accommodated. All the courses were nigh on perfect & to 3* standard bar one pedestrian course - say 1*.  Service exemplary: allowing to bring our own special bottle. Corkage not advised but a reasonable €25. Superb wine list with depth & breadth. Fairly pricey but not unreasonable.  On the face of it high priced menu but ultimately value for money.  One niggle expensive bottled water.  We stayed in hotel for 2 nights (excellent rooms fairly priced) - it is in a peaceful setting but isolated, if you are planning to drive.  Probably the finest cooking I have had the pleasure to eat."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,"Wonderful Cossetting Service, Great Food, Great value","Visited in September with my other half. Restaurant and Hotel are out of the way and a difficult drive in the dark. Was sat down on arrival and glasses of champagne served. We did not take the 5 or 7-course, but had ordered a starter to share and the beef and duck mains respectively, and a desert. We were eventually served a total of 7-different courses each! Every dish was outstanding. Total damage, with 2 glasses of champagne and a half-bottle of local Riesling, was less than 200 Euros. An incredible value in my view, for the quality and quantity we received. The drive back (20 minutes to Wehlen) was less fun in the dark and rain, but I will be back next time, no question!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,Outstanding !,"We have booked this hotel for the start of a wonderful stay in Germany. Small, luxury hotel with an exellent service! Restaurant offers the most outstanding dishes. We will be back!"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,30,Undecided,"Well I went to this restaurant knowing it had 3 michelin stars. On this basis, I was disappointed. For me, nothing should go wrong in a 3-star restaurant.    The service was very attentive and faultless, but the food was not 3 star quality in my opinion.  The lobster they served was papery and lacked flavour. The veal with fois gras and sweetbread and truffle was underwelming - the dish was too strong on butter and the leek overpowered the subtle veal and truffle taste.    They also served shaved mint on every dish - what a lack of inventiveness! It did nothing to enhance the flavour of the meal either.    I also thought they served too much bread to start with and given that the wait between courses was very long, encourages guests to nibble on bread.    I was suprised we only got 1 pre-dessert because we ordered only 1 dessert. I never encountered this before.    Overall it serves good food but definitely not 3 star quality. Also the grounds of the hotel itself need some manicuring. The pond was filthy. I did not think it was worth the detour."

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,best meal ever,"We ate here for dinner and had the best meal of our lives. We spent 4 hours experiencing the highest levels of culiniary art imaginable. Yes it is a 3 michelin star restaurant and yes it is expensive. But the quality of the food, the cooking, the presentation, the service and the attention to every detail are all out of this world. The two of spent nearly 400 euros on dinner for two and we came away saying that it was cheap!!! We are not rich but we had the experience of a life time.    We stayed in the hotel for two nights, it was amazing to be be able to stagger to your room after dinner without having to drive"

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,best restaurant in the world,I have been to a few three star restaurant but this is the best. two visits so far and even if expectations were extremely high the second time I was more impressed than I expected.    The lover of molecular cuisine will not rate this as high as I do. It is classical a bit innovative. It has the disadvantage of not having the easiest location for raw material but it really doesnt show.    Its strenght is its perfect tast balance and harmony simply astoning. Gault millaur rates it an imporessive 19.5of 20 and I tend to agree.    Wine list is OK for a restaurant of this quality but not more. Service is perhaps not up to three star level but still of highest class.    Value for money is simply great calculate with about 200 euro per person with interesting wines. less than the menu price at comparable restaurants in other places!

Waldhotel Sonnora Restaurant,50,"Deep In The Forest, A Luxury Hideaway","Summary: This hidden treasure is assuredly the best of its kind.    Hidden away in western Germany, hours from the nearest big city, the Waldhotel Sonnora is, despite the cliché, one of the best kept secrets among the elite Three Star restaurants in the Michelin guide. Elegance with contemporary class pervades this unique property at the edge of the small town of Dreis, a country village unknown even to most Germans.  With its twelve generously spaced tables in the main dining room and 20 luxurious hotel rooms for discerning overnight guests, Sonnora is a one of a kind restaurant with rooms, not a hotel with a restaurant. The subtle difference in this description is often lost on casual visitors, but it means that the main function of the gloriously well-presented property is the top level cuisine and matching service. The hotel rooms are merely a very pleasant and comfortable accommodation.  Although I have addressed the issue of Michelin Stars vs. other rating/award systems before, let me say again here that for the dining guest seeking the very best in food and service, the few restaurants that carry the Michelin Three Star rating have nothing to do with the often touted and generally misunderstood multiple stars, diamonds and other nonsense that so many USA restaurants attach to their names. Outside of France, there are very few Michelin Three Star properties, (currently, in October 2009, there are eight in Germany) and this one is even rarer because it’s not near or between major Germany cities.  Nestled close to the German border with Luxemburg and France, Dreis is the sort of little town that the autobahns fail to touch and even the marvelous German Rail system ignores.  Although I had planned to drive a rental car from Frankfurt, at the last minute I decided to take a train: about a three and a half hour trip with a change of trains in Koblenz.    The local countryside, near the Mosel River, is major wine country and the fine cuisine at Sonnora simply amplifies the essence of fine wines and grapes grown nearby.    As the train wound its way along the Mosel River banks west of Koblenz, the steep terraces of grape vines provided a fascinating vista with the occasional fortress/castle on the hilltops adding Teutonic romance to the scene.    In about an hour from Koblenz, the fast regional train deposited me in the small city of Wittlich, about 10 km from the hotel. In trying to assist me beyond the rail connections, the agent at Frankfurt station had indicated on my itinerary that when I got to Wittlich, I was then to take a bus from the train station to the bus depot at the center of town and then another bus to Dreis. To my surprise, when I arrived at the bus depot, there was no bus going to Dreis, no telephone and no taxi. Walking a short distance, I found two gentlemen in a local Greek restaurant who summoned a taxi for me.    All of this travel was taking its toll in time and Euros. I left my hotel in Frankfurt at about 9 a.m. and the Frankfurt station at 9:42 a.m. I reached the Waldhotel at a little after 1 p.m. The cost to travel was about $85 including the taxi and a small tip.    Fortunately, I was in time for lunch and enjoyed an excellent glass of champagne before a small appetizer of veal tartar topped with a thick cream and generous portion of caviar. This was followed with a double consommé of oxtail with tiny raviolis and vegetables. The luncheon entrée of turbot on a delicious fresh tomato and basil base was enough to take care of my hunger from missing breakfast and easily hold me over until dinnertime.    As an interesting surprise, the glass of German Sauvignon Blanc, (in a region so famous for its Riesling Mosel whites), provided a fine compliment to the excellent soup and seafood luncheon.    Every aspect of these first few hours at Sonnora was relaxing, comforting and already making it worth the trip. My large, category I hotel room with a furnished balcony looking out over the gardens provided an opportunity to rest up a bit and plan how I’d spend the evening. The moderately sized bathroom had somewhat austere features, but chromed plumbing fixtures with brass trim, decent towels and the commonplace stand-up only stall shower. The sleeping area had a beautifully wood trimmed double bed, plus a full length credenza and desk. Leading to the balcony was a sitting room with two upholstered chairs and a CRT TV on a wooden cabinet/refrigerator. Next to this was a roll top writing desk. Virtually all furnishings and the room’s décor appeared to be new. The architect’s floor plan was dated 2005. Either the room was just recently done over or they have incredibly fine maintenance.    Dinner at seven brought new delights. Chef and owner Helmut Thieltges’ style combines simplicity with creative manipulation of textures and flavors. What I mean by this gibberish is that great European culinary skill is apparent in all of the dishes that my companions and I had, but it is not flashy. Aside from the liberal topping of caviar on a few different items, the presentations and seasoning were normal and straightforward.  This style appeals to me because there is no subterfuge, as is often common with lesser cooks who seek to overwhelm the diner with mysterious combinations of rare and odd ingredients stacked on the plate to look more like what the plumber left when he finished fixing your sink than like an edible meal.    Fortunately, Thieltges has not succumbed to the ailment of TV/celebrity chefs and his approach is colorful and attractive to nose, eye and palate, letting the presentation, aromas and tastes speak for themselves. Also, thankfully, the menu is short, but not sparse, with an alluring mix of fish, game and meat. Without itemizing the meal, I must say that the most outstanding dish I had was a pair of large, lightly pan seared Breton scallops on a bed of caramelized sweet onions. The tenderness and flavor of these twin beauties exceeded any seafood in memory.    Waldhotel Sonnora is a family owned and operated business. If you plan to go, be prepared for a grand experience in the old style, resembling nothing you may have previously encountered in contemporary chain hotels. This is no Four Seasons Hotel and thankfully, it is not trying to emulate such.    Room rates range from around about 90 Euros for a single to 280 Euros for doubles, possibly more in high seasons.    Restaurant prices are steeper: A la carte entrees range from 35 to 50 Euros. The double consommé I had for lunch was, I think, the least expensive item on the menu at 24 Euros. I would estimate the typical dinner for two, with wine and at least three courses, will cost around 500 Euros. That may sound normal for high end US establishments, but remember this is with the Euro-dollar exchange at about $1.5 to one Euro. That means your dollar now buys about .60 Euros. So a 500 Euro meal now costs about $725, depending on the exchange rate you may get or your credit card company’s degree of skill in adding additional fees for foreign transactions.    Service throughout the meal was monumentally well directed, smooth and perfect in every way. The staff was attentive and obliging in both English and German.    One other note of possible interest: unlike the rest of Germany, some small hotels like Sonnora have added elegant smoking salons near the dining rooms for those who wish to smoke cigarettes or even cigars. There are no zero smoking guest rooms but I found no traces of smoking, other than an ashtray in my room, anywhere else but in the Red Saloon, which is also perfect for after dinner brandies, coffee and desserts. Apparently there was enough hue and cry from various influential sources in Germany to cause governments to move back a few paces and permit very limited smoking in the premises. How long this will last it is hard to say, but Waldhotel Sonnora is normally fully booked and getting dinner or room reservations is not easy, so apparently there is plenty of interest in the more liberal smoking rules here.    This could be the ultimate romantic getaway for couples or a very small group of savvy dining friends who want to get out of the city for a few luxurious days. I would not recommend it for children because they will be bored and uncomfortable with the adult atmosphere."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Another stellar dinner,"Having had such a wonderful dinner here towards the end of last year, our expectations remained high. Fortunately we were not disappointed and enjoyed the attentive yet relaxed atmosphere and course after course of top notch ingredients all combined together with the utmost in finesse and skill.    Bau is truly one of the world's greatest chefs and manages to combine the best of French and Japanese cuisine without anything ever feeling contrived. If you appreciate the finest food and want to experience the exceptional, then you simply have to dine at Bau."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Best meal ever - Christian Bau is a genius,"Wow! What a spectacularly amazing meal… Christian Bau’s Paris-Tokyo menu is sheer genius. Each course is a work of art and the menu in its entirety is perfectly constructed. There are no gimmicks - just brilliantly executed and inventive dishes which combine Japanese and French ingredients and cooking styles. We’ve eaten in many top end restaurants (including other 3*) and think this meal was right at the top, probably the best.  The front of house team was also excellent - young, knowledgeable, super professional with just the right balance of friendliness. The sommelier provided us with a wine pairing of local wines, which was an interesting and very well-chosen accompaniment for the meal.  The meal was well paced with a very good amount of food. By the end (several hours later) we were very full - make sure you go there hungry. The bill wasn’t cheap, but was truly worth every penny.  The only thing to add for those thinking of booking is that the menu is very focussed on fish/ shellfish, some of it served raw. There was only one meat course in our menu. This suited us very well. The quality of ingredients is outstanding.  For anyone who is a foodie you simply must visit. It is a meal you will never forget."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,"Exceptional, spectacular & more","We had had dinner here booked for March 2020 which unfortunately fell victim to the pandemic, so it was with great excitement that we finally got to dine here. Given its 3* Michelin status and the rave reviews from serious foodies our expectations were sky high.    All too frequently we have been in similar situations with other restaurants and found the reality falling short - to varying degrees- relative to our expectations. Fortunately Bau went way above and beyond any aspirations that we may have had for our dinner there.    The restaurant itself is small with less than 25 covers and is housed in the historic Schloss which is charmingly decorated (quite unlike the main hotel).    The service here is friendly, engaging and doesn't take itself too seriously even though the kitchen here is of the very highest calibre.    The menu is sensibly a tasting menu only format that allows the dinner to experience the very widest variety of the chef's creations. If even that isn't quite enough one can add on extra dishes which is a nice touch.    The wine list here is stellar with a huge array of hard to find bottles from the best producers. The sommelier is passionate and super knowledgeable. Also unlike in many other high end restaurants, if the other front of house of staff are busy, they happily step in which as a diner is really great to see.    How was the food? Exquisite, sublime and every other superlative that you can think of and more. The quality of the ingredients themselves was incredible and they were crafted into the most complex yet harmonius creations by the genius chef Bau. Words really do not do justice to how good our dinner was. We are fortunate to eat in many 3* establishments and Bau is on another (higher) level compared to pretty much all of them. It was probably one of the top 3 dinners of our lives - no hyperbole.    If you enjoy the finest food then Bau will exceed your expectations, the only downside is that everywhere else will seem pedestrian by comparison."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,"Fantastic meal, sadly a bit boring on the wines.","Everything is magnificent. Luxury and comfort combined is always a success. There are rooms at the « castle » and also in the modern building where the pools are. It’s spacious, and not too expensive considering the very high 5* quality of the hotel part.    It’s the same as the restaurant whose standing, service and food are all of outstanding quality. Great welcome (even though I initially could not properly sit on the chair they had provided but that was solved quite rapidly). The maître d’hôtel is very good and so is the sommelière Nina Mann.    The menu is very elaborate, between french and Japanese inspirations, with lots of exquisite dishes. We were amazed by the beef tartare in the mises en bouche, one of the tastiest I have ever had (and I’m Belgian, beef tartare aka « américain » we know something about that!!), transported by the Toro tuna with caviar and  Soy, blow away by the tarbot, surprise but the truffle dessert etc etc. Every dish was 18 to 19/20 with remarquable precision and display.    The wine list is a 65 pages book with an impressive list of German wines, plus french and international but…. NO natural wines at all. I mentioned that to the sommelière and she said she would like to have some but the chef does not like natural wines and has made law « no natural wines in my restaurant ! ».    This is of course very sad when you’re a 3-stars restaurant as Michelin itself is awarding sommeliers who serve varied selections between wines, sake, beers, natural wines, pet nats etc. At the end of the meal I got to greet the chef and told him that. I could see his face closing like an alligator on a steak. “I don’t like it” is not a reason to deprive the public from a whole world of tastes and surprising creations by the “newest” winemakers of the world. And when you go to restaurants of the 50Best list you end up tasting naturals wines 95% of the times. (Well not at Geranium).    When you hit a 3-stars restaurant with a bill of 4 digits for two, you deserve to be surprised and amazed on the plate but also in the glass. Even though Nina serves very good wines, none of them was worth a “let me write this down, I must get it”. There is something to work on there.    But it was a great meal anyway. Just in the plate even though, again, Nina did the best job she could on the wines.    Attention, also don’t eat 5 hours before this meal. It’s quite a lot of food to eat !"

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Perfection,"Wonderful experience at Herr Bau’s restaurant. He had the intention of visiting for several years and finally made an expedition to the Saarland to dine at Victor’s. We stayed in the hotel, which is very convenient and allows one to fully enjoy the wine pairing. The restaurant is located at the historic Schloss and provides a nice environment. The atmosphere is relaxed and the service friendly. Little touches like the personalised reservation and the table decor add to the experience. The meal starts with aperitivo and a large selection of amuse bouche, some of them truly works of art. The menu offers the possibility to exclude two dishes, which I would recommend, otherwise I think it would be excessively long. Bread was delicious, both types, the French style baguette and the sunflower Brot. As far as the menu is concerned, everything was executed to perfection. If I have to chose a favourite, perhaps I would highlight the Steinbutt (rodaballo). We enjoyed our dinner enormously. A truly master chef.  Last but not least, we found the price very reasonable. Really worth visiting and enjoy the magic of this wonderful maestro of the kitchen. Vielen Dank, Herr Bau. We will return."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,"Brilliant food and brilliant staff, come hungry!","The food is outstanding and so is the attentive and kind staff. We particularly liked the sommelier and it was a pleasure to say hi to Christian after the meal.    The timing of the serving of the dishes was perfect and it's good to keep in mind that you need a good few hours to get through a meal here.    The only possible downside is that although the individual dishes are small, the the total amount of food together with the tiny in between dishes is enormous so it may be hard to be able to enjoy all of it if you take a full menu. At least we haven't experienced this amount of food at other Michelin starred restaurants. Unless you're a really big eater, make sure to have a reduced menu. The smallest option which only includes some four dishes is probably more than enough for most thanks to all the extra amuse bouche that come along.    It's a very small restaurant with a nice atmosphere and toned down interior and it can get a little loud in case some other guests are loud."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,10,Incredibly BAD experience!!,"I invited my best agents of my company here yesterday to celebrate a very good year 2019. We were all very much looking forward to this evening.    The bad experience already started weeks before. I was in contact with the restaurant to get organised, and to my big surprise they didn’t answer about 2 mails out of three. I had to sign a contract because we were a party of 8 and send them my credit card details as a guarantee that they would charge in case we would cancel prior to the evening. Firstly I think this is a strange and not very friendly practise, and secondly they never answered me back to confirm the reservation.    Then the evening itself:    Second very strange thing is, as you arrive to the table the first thing you see is a card saying “no pictures allowed”! No pictures allowed?? How in their right mind wouldn’t wanna take pictures of a 3* dinner?? That mentality reminds me of East Germany that was ruled like a dictatorship until 30 years ago.    Since we were a party of 8 and had a lot of expensive bottles to drink (Dom Pérignon 1999, Puligny Montrachet, Côte Rôtie, etc...), I’m sure we were a bit louder than the average couples who come here to have a romantic dinner. But I constantly made sure that we didn’t exaggerate. I even called some of my guests the next day to ask their opinion about it if my judgement might have been wrong. One of them being a former Cargolux Engineer said “during the whole dinner no, except maybe in the end we were a bit too loud, but we were alone in the restaurant at that point.” Anyways the restaurant was almost empty the whole time, except us there were only four other guests sitting far from us on the other side of the restaurant.    At some point my business comes to me and says “I just went to talk to the chef/owner who was standing there, he’s really weird, I tried to get a small conversation with him but he hardly answered me, he didn’t seem to care”, I told him maybe he’s just being shy, not wanting him to be disappointed in the person who had just cooked for us.    By now all other guests had left so we used to opportunity to FaceTime a good friend of ours in Canada, at this point we might have talked a bit louder, but we were alone in the restaurant so nobody cared, or at least I thought so. After paying the bill (3500€!!) I asked the sommelier politely if we didn’t make too much noise and she said it was ok. (There were only waiters that night, no manager no maître d’hôtel nothing...) It’s at this point that suddenly the “shy and quiet” came out from behind a corner where he was hiding and listening to our conversation secretly and said: “This is not going to happen a second time, you were way too loud in the end, there are hotel rooms above the restaurant!” I couldn’t believe my ears!!??? The chef/owner of a three star restaurant without saying hello or asking if we enjoyed our evening comes to his guests and talks to them like this?? How are we supposed to know there’s a hotel above a 3* restaurant?? And how could we know that they didn’t invest in a proper sound isolation t separate a 3* restaurant from a 5* Hotel??? And this after just paying 3500€???    I right away put him back in his place telling him that this is not a way to talk to guests in a 3* star restaurant to which he just arrogantly replied that he had been to over 90 3* restaurants and that he knew better. Also I tried to explain to him that he could expect selling expensive wine bottles to a group of 8 people and then expect them to shut their mouth all night long. But that’s not all, now comes the best part of all, as he saw I don’t allow him to talk that way to us he suddenly raised his right arm and showed us the door!!! Can you believe this?? In a 3* star Michelin restaurant??? UNBELIEVABLE!!!    This is definitely a place where guest are not welcomed, they are just tolerated as long as they shut their drink, pay, shut their mouth and leave. The 3* star have certainly got into his head. He very visible has no idea of how to treat a guest and of hospitality. It’s not enough be be in a good guide, you also need to have a minimum of good manners and friendliness.    I have never ever been treated that way in any restaurant or hotel in my life, not even at Mc Donald’s. On top of that the food was not that great this time, surely not 3* food. The dessert was so bad that hardly anyone of us finished it. My advise is, if you want a really good and friendly German 3* dinner where guest are guests and are really welcomed as such go to “Klaus Erfurt” in Saarbrücken which is just 30min drive from there. Just don’t come waste your money to this place!!!    One of my two favourite quotes are: “Le client est Roi. » (The client is the King) and: “Go where you are celebrated, not where you are tolerated.”    I leave you with this, and I hope the Michelin guide is going to read this and do something about this kind of utmost impolite and arrogant behaviour."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,10,Just normal food,"Of all 3 Michelin star restaurants I met in Germany (5) this was the least interesting, and I would add, by far. It’s normal food, sometimes bland. Their treatment with clients is quite unfriendly and arrogant, which helps to turn the experience even worse."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Pure perfection,"Three stars might not be enough for this restaurant. From the food, to the wine, to the service, everything was perfect.    Unique tastes and combinations are just one of the highlights of this restaurant. The sommelier was fantastic and very helpful.    The mix of Asian and European cuisine is amazing.    We go once or twice a year and we’re never disappointed.    This restaurant never ceases to amaze us."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,One of the best dining experiences ever.,Some of the best food I’ve ever eaten. Had the 5 course meal and each dish was better than the previous one. Excellent service and fantastic wine selection to go with the dishes.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,40,of course one of the best in the world,the paris tokio menu is 60% sensational and 40% very good.... but it is to MUCH and to much stretched out. we ate from 7 to after midnight and couldnt sleep the whole night ...to much to handle. service was flawless but arrogant. and as i said we waited sometimes 25 min between courses and it takes only 2 minutes to eat them.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Great food and service,"We had a really perfect dinner at Victors fine dining. The staff was very friendly and professional, the food was perfectly executed and the setting was lively.    The cuisine is great, including modern Japanese touches while nevertheless perfectly mastering classic aspects of traditional French cuisine as well. Tastes are subtle yet surprising creating a wholesome experience. My favorite dish of the menu was the lobster (even though I usually don’t particularly like lobster). The wine list is extensive and prices are very reasonable for this type of restaurant.    I also found the staff very welcoming and managing to create a relaxed atmosphere while maintaining all the required professional standards and being extremely (!) attentive.    Really very positive experience and would recommend to anyone without reservations."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,paris tokio ...impressiv tastes BUT LONG LONG dinner,"we ate yesterday at BAU and he is really the top japanese inspired chef in europe with 3 michelin stars. i would say 80% of the dishes were sensational and the rest was good... wine selection also nice and the wines were not overpriced. 2 things you need to be aware off: even with only 14 guests the pace is very slow and you will eat from 7 pm to after midnight and you will be really really full in the end. almost to much food - i couldnt sleep properly after. also you cannot mix what means if you want to eat the classic menu and your partner the PARIS TOKIO they will not do it. so we both had the paris tokio but didnt regret it. caviar, gambaroni, blue fin tuna, king crab, wagyu beef ...the food costs will be very high but so will be your bill....we paid 1000 euro for 2 with a bottle of montrose for 200 euro (what is a very low price for a 2004 with 94 parker points)."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,10,An unmitigated disaster,"For all intents and purposes ""the"" destination meal of a trip to Germany, Victor’s Fine Dining by Christian Bau will forever be remembered as the second Michelin 3* Restaurant walked out of, nearly four hours after sitting down and still with several plates to go as the staff largely ignored the solo American in favor of tables speaking German.    26 minutes *average* between courses, including Amuse and Course 1. Guest inquiries about technique or ingredients met by ""I don't know"" or “I’ll find out” with no answer. Empty plates lingering on the table for nine minutes in a room with 1:3 ratio of servers to diners. Same scene repeated every course, such that kitchen could would never know if one table could benefit from faster pacing. And to cap it off, an e-mail to the restaurant explaining the issues entirely ignored.    No matter how good the Food, and yes the Langoustine was stunning, there is simply no excuse for an experience so poor, and particularly not at this level or a cost of over 200€ after a quarter was sliced of the total for items skipped en route to better Restaurants."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Perfect afternoon,"Brilliant restaurant which completely lives up to its 3-star expectations. Daring, but well-designed mix of classic French and Japanese influences, without ever going into mannerism or easy effects. 5 Courses ('ParisTokio') really seem plenty, with all appetizers and amuses preceding them. Took us a day to feel slightly hungry again. Truly excellent sommelier, be prepared for hefty price tags for the wines though - all in all this was our second most expensive dinner ever, and mind you we have been around a bit. The restaurant has a very limited capability, which gives it a nice and cosy feeling. Be sure to get your coffee and sweets 'bento box' in the atmospheric chapel room ."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,A Music Box of Delight,"Jewels for the eye and the tastebuds was how we saw each one of the amuse bouches Chef Christian Bau constructed at Victor’s fine Dining restaurant. Chef Bau knows how to pile on tiny dots of flavour while keeping the blend distinctive and exciting. And diners looking for more. Fortunately we had the entirety of chef’s ‘Tradition’ menu to look forward to. We weren’t disappointed. Each course was a revelation of how with skill and imagination the combination of ingredients can sing solo as well as part of the chorus. The blue fin tuna with pickled radish and kouyu was the first movement in an evening that was a symphony of flavours from the tuna to the wagyu with aubergine. The courses moved along quite briskly. The staff were well practised but not chilly. They knew what they were doing but could spare time to talk to guests about the food and wine.  So many chefs neglect dessert. Not Chef Bau. Of the two of his desserts we tried it was hard to say which was better as both were so spectacular. There is little to compare the ‘Ring of Desire 2.0’ as his delicate and pistachio ring chimed with intensity along with the Valrhona araguani which harmonised with it and was a fitting end to the meal until the sweet bento box arrived. This was the climax to the meal, a multi-layered bento box with marshmallow, fruit gels, chocolates and more. Can’t speak highly enough of Victor’s Fine Dining with chef Christian Bau."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,40,Gourmet at a high level,Victors serves gourmet food at a high level in charming surroundings in an old castle with diligent professional staff. We had the anniversary menu and I have to admit that this time we were a bit disappointed. The menu seemed to lack edge and so did the wine. You couldn’t help feeling that the restaurant was in some ways getting a little bit tired.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Top level gourmet,Victors is a top level culinary experience. The food is innovative and creative with a constant focus on taste as well as the visual impression. A dinner at Victors is an experience that should be repeated with certain intervals to remind yourself how good it can get if you really try.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,3 Michelin star at its best!,"From the very beginning the food was absolutely amazing, multiple Amuse bouches to start off with. Beautiful presentation of all dishes, all the dishes had a lot of different tastes that perfectly worked out together. The service was just great. Great winelist, still decently priced for 3 Michelin starred restaurant. We went for the wines from Markus Molitor including the 2002 vintage which was great. Not a single bad word to say. It is really worth a trip!"

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,the perfect dinner,"great choices - it is more a fish & crab focussed restaurant - meals are fantastic - perfect taste - great chef - we got 2 rounds of ""amuse bouche"" - it is worth every penny of the high price - wine selection was gorgeous - we will come back!"

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Expensive but a fabulous experience,"Christian Bau is a culinary genius. Having dinner at his restaurant is a culinary experience. The food is exquisite and the service was phenomenal. Our five-hour dinner flew by. We could not believe it was midnight when we walked out, totally sated and satisfied."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Bravo..!,"This is a Michelin three star restaurant in the upper echelons of that category.    Presentation of every dish including a plethora of amuse-bouches was incredibly skillful. A standout for us amongst the 5 courses of our lunch was a dish of perfectly cooked lobster with a beautifully balanced nage redolent of thai spices and bergamot. A tranche of turbot with textures of peas; and chanterelles, which followed, although perfectly executed, seemed one dimensional in comparison.    Additionally, one or two of our amuse-bouches were so complex and full flavored, our palates were a little befuddled by the time the main dishes started to arrive. The japanese influences may also be a tad over done, but this should be read as minor criticism of cooking which is at the highest level.    We also adored our beautifully balanced dessert of a frozen verbena flavored parfait with raspberry, slices of green baby peach and pink peach sorbet.    Service was perfect. No more to say.    Christian Bau's cooking is worthy of even wider recognition. It is expensive, but the quality makes it fair value. Bravo!"

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,30,Nice food but not worth three stars,"Food was good but not as inventive as one would expect for 3 stars. Not better than any of the 1 star restaurants I've been to. The desserts were of very high quality though.  The price of the wine pairing was not shown on the menu and it was really overpriced - 5 glasses of wine of max 100 ml for €130.  Service was ok but not up to the standards one would expect for 3 stars and they were clearly struggling to explain the food in English.  We mentioned at the reservation that we do not eat foie gras, the waitress confirmed this at the beginning of the evening and still there was one dish including foie gras!"

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,30,Not 3* - 1 at the most,"Overpriced compared to the quality of the food which was really not better than a number of 1* star restaurants I have tried (some of which were definetly better) but way more expensive. The desserts were the highlights. They offered a wine pairing to the menu, but did not give a price. It turned out to be quite the rip-off- 5 glasses which barely covered the bottom of the glass (more like a tasting glass really) for which they charged 130 euro per person. The service was nice but again not really three star. They 'hovered' too visibly near you most of the time and several struggled to explain the food in English."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Masterchef,"This 3 star Michelin restaurant is a most try for the people who seeks an extraordinary dining experience.    Knowledgeable waiters, excellent service and food from dreams. Highly recommendable and if going as a couple book a night a the hotel in same location for an unforgettable evening.    I have been here 3 times and every visit was something special. There are more personal then guests in the restaurant so you in for special treat."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,top class - best table in Germany,"This was the second time I took my family and parents to Schloss Berg, and the four and a half hour lunch was among the best meals I have ever eaten. Christian Bau is clearly at the top of his culinary art, and his more and more Japanese-inspired cuisine is amazing. The amuse bouche - and there are six or even of them - are world class, and the cornet with beef tartare is almost a signature dish. I had the five course lunch menu with yellowfin mackerel, blue lobster, atlantic turbot, venison cooked to perfection and the signature ""Bau-stein"" dessert. My daughter had the Atlantic turbot with some pasta as a main and a lovely fruit dessert with raspberries and strawberries. The wine list is strong on German wines from Mosel, Saar and Ahr, and the (new) sommelier recommended to us two very good bottles of white wine from the Saar. I am not surprised that top food critics and food bloggers rate this as one of the best tables in the world, and the three Michelin stars are more than deserved."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Surprisingly perfect :),"You don't come here only to eat and drink but to have a memorable experience of fine dining.    Compliments to the chef Mr. Bau who surprises his gourmet guests for many years with creative and innovative haute cuisine. Light French dishes with an Asian touch. (Menu Paris-Tokyo)  Service and decoration is also perfect .  The sommelière has good information to give about the great wines served.    The amount of money spent is worth this great and unique fine dining experience.    The allinclusive menu Paris-Tokyo with wine pairing is around 300 Euros pp. (water and coffee incl.)  They also have another option which is called ""carte blanche"" = surprise menu with 3 (small glasses of wine) for a little less than 200 Euros pp.    The restaurant is situated on the German/Lux. border in a nice old castle.    Great and outstanding restaurant :)"

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Happy days are here again!,"I am a firm believer that you should be careful comparing apples to pears. A 3 star restaurant is obviously good, some highly trained and experienced eaters have said so. As this was my first (and maybe only) visit to a 3 star restaurant I can only compare it with other restaurants I have been to. Which might not be fair to either.  However, the food at Victor's if fantastic. You are in heaven even before the ""real"" menu starts. So much taste in even the smallest appetizer - amazing.  We had the Paris - Tokyo menu which is 7 dishes plus. Plenty of food but as the affair takes a full evening you are not stuffed when you leave. To be honest I could have skipped one or two of the dishes, but not because they ware not tasty. I am not a big fan of artichokes that is one reason - and I am happy with one dessert, I do not need three. BUT - there was nothing in the taste or especially not in the presentation of the food that was less than perfect.  Only one mishap during the evening and that was that one of the waitresses knocked over a glass of water!!! Mon dieu - now big deal for our group, but I don't think she would have been as forgiven by the michelin jury as she was by us. (The way the rest of the staff came to rescue was however very impressive).  I would definitely recommend anyone that has a big wallet, interest in food and a special occasion to go. It is a great experience."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,An experience,"Victors Gourmet is always an experience. The food has always been good but the service is also getting very good and the wine service is absolutely excellent. When at Victor you feel that they are striving for perfection, whether it is the small pieces of art that you are served as you work your way through the menu or the black gloves the staff wears when the touch anything you will be touching, not to mention an exceptional sommelier that can with a big smile puts together an excellent extensive wine menu by the glass based on your wishes as well as the food served. We will be back soon."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,An experience for the Gourmet,Victors Gourmet is almost a work of art. You will be served an array of small dishes in combination with home baked bread and butter. The courses look fantastic and each is almost a piece of art in itself. The taste is delicious and often surprising. The wine service is excellent and the waiters are doing there best to live up the restaurants three Michelin star status. At the end of the evening you can hardly move and you are so overwhelmed that you can't recall all the delicacies you have been eating unless your refer to the personalized menu you have been given. Victors is an experience for everyone that enjoy gourmet food on the very highest level.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Absolutely sublime,"We had a wonderful evening at this incredible restaurant last night. We went for the Paris-Tokyo menu and what a joy it was. The presentation was stunning and then when we tasted the food, I really just ran out of superlatives. Sensational, heavenly, amazing...I could go on. The kobe beef was just to die for. The service was excellent, very pleasant, unobtrusive, helpful staff, overseen by the very friendly capable Yildiz Bau, wife of the incredible chef Christian Bau. Decor is wonderful. All in all a truly wonderful experience and one which I would recommend to everybody to try at least once. The Bau family are doing a great job."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,30,Three stars and disappointing,Of course expectations are always high. Even as this was my 30th 3 star experience. But in this case there are definitely reasons to be critical. Ambience seems to have been created without any regard for taste. The food was excellent but too salty (escargots for example). Service not really friendly nor effective.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,I was in heaven for 4.5h,Been there with my family for a christmas dinner.    All of us went on a big journey - meaning we were eating the seven course meal. Add another four amuse-bouches (three before the first course and one after the seven) and you have a perfect mixture of all kinds of flavors and thus a perfect dinner.    It's more than just a typical dinner of this category (as found in Germany) as most dishes are inspired by japanese cuisine.    Pricy but would definitely recommend this 'journey' to everyone who enjoys food and can appreciate this art!

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,What a feast !,We enjoyed an incredible 5 course menu in this well deserved 3* restaurant. If you like food and the art of making it. I would strongly recommend this restaurant. Service is practically perfect. We were served by a very nice and very capable young sommelier. Perfect knowledge of the dishes and wines that went with it.  We didn't have lunch and we had difficulty to finish our plates :)  We Loved the Japanese inspired dishes. Like all great chefs do.  Would love to come again

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Absolutely perfect!,"""From Paris to Tokyo"" was delicious, well thought and so surprising! The service was perfect and very attentional. If you want to experience catching tastes and lovely art dishes don't hesitate, its worth the price! The Wines that followed the dishes were absolutely great! Thank you for this lovely evening! Merci villmols! Daniel S."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,very nice,there were some changes since our last visits and we loved the new interior design. having a great table in the back of the Restaurant was very pleasant. the Service was excellent and the sommeliere is fantastic. the menu is beautiful but the portions are a bit to heavy to enjoy the large menu. all the courses have been wonderful anyway.

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,If you love seafood ....,"First ate at Christian Bau's restaurant in December last year and it was so good that we returned in April. The meal in April ranks as one of the finest meals I have ever eaten.    If you love seafood then this restaurant is one of the must visit places in Europe. It is a fantastic combination of the extreme depth of flavour you expect in top end European restaurants, coupled with subtle Asian flavours that evoked memories of travelling through Japan and SE Asia. All topped off with some of the best desserts I've eaten.    The chef believes in welcoming his guests, which involves a seemingly endless, and delicious, stream of beautiful small ""gifts"". The tuna with burnt rice particularly stood out - amazing flavours and texture.    Other dishes that stood out were the turbot and the langoustine. The ""banana split"" dessert was quite simply stunning - one of the greatest desserts I have ever eaten.    Fantastic sommelier, great service. Be prepared for a very lengthy meal (I think ours lasted over 4hrs), but that's part of the experience. It's almost a shock to the system when you finally get up to leave to re-enter the real world, as you've been cocooned for so long in this wonderful restaurant."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Perfect,"Had a long-awaited meal at the Schloss Berg gourmet restaurant and it was tremendous from beginning to end. Easily one of the best meals I have ever had, if not the best. Afterwards I went to check what Mr. Hayler had to say about his meals there over the years and he said something to the same effect - it was one of the best meals he had ever had in his life - 20/20. How this place could not be in the top 100 is a mystery and a farce. I can't even offer any constructive criticism because I have none - this was a flawless dining experience. I have something like 330 reviews on TA and take this quite seriously, so when I am this impressed by a meal it is something of a miracle.    We had the tasting menu with wines and virtually everything was fully three-star territory. Not even going to try to deconstruct the meal, all I will say is that it was about 4 hours long, every single course was plated beautifully and tasted just as good as it looked. Service was also perfect - there are only something like 30 covers, so spilt water or crumbs were immediately attended to, but without the utter intrusiveness of some other three-stars. Paired wines were primarily Rieslings as others have noted, but I had no complaints with any of them.    I came out thinking that I am wasting my money in London. Having eaten in probably 90% of the more higly rated restaurants in that city, there isn't a single one that is even half as good as Schloss Berg.    One parting thought - bring your wallet and your appetite. This is an extraordinary meal but at an extraordinary price. For the full experience I would think 400 euros is probably a good estimate. I ate so much I literally couldn't eat anything else for about a day, so they definitely ensure you get your money's worth. One other thought - give yourself some time to find it - it isn't easy and the GPS failed us."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,What a perfection!,"On my bucket list such a long time, finally i've got to Schloss Berg and experienced one of my best meals of the past few years. The lunch i enjoyed yesterday was an impeccable, beautiful and technically strong and complex one.  I admire Christian Bau's talent and creativity. The descret japanese influence, the harmony of so many ingredients, flavours and colours made me speechless."

Victor's Fine Dining by Christian Bau,50,Three Stars is Not Enough,"This may be premature, but I nominate Christian Bau at Schloss Berg for the most innovative chef of the year. The restaurant is quite small, about 30 covers, in the Victors'z Rezidenz hotel - a surprising location as the hotel is nowhere at the level of the restaurant. The restaurant is charming and service is top notch, with a veyr knowledgeable and committed sommelier. Christian Bau offers a single menu: you can have all of it or leave some dishes off. We had the medium menu. The menu is preceded by a series of ""greetings"" from the chef; each is a jewel in minature. There's a strong influence of Asiatic spices combined with the best of Continental cuisine. But everything is at the height of subtlety."

L'Enclume,50,"Amazing food, service and creativity",L’enclume is in the middle of the charming village of Cartmel. We parked on the racecourse which seems to be the main car park of the village. Less than 5 minutes and we are at the restaurant.  L’enclume is an experience. The menu is on the table but you can choose to keep it in the envelope and each course is a surprise. Attention to detail is amazing. Every course has bespoke cutlery and each dish is perfectly placed on the dish or plate.  The breadth of the menu focuses on fresh and local. The offering from the farm is a stunning use of the freshest vegetables and flowers. The snacks are a superb punch of flavour to open the meal. The Scallop and monkish are beautiful and the deserts range from the freshness of the tunworth cheese ice cream to the signature Anvil caramel. Cheese is optional and there is a range of a dozen cheese on a trolley which is wheeled to you.  There is a wide range of drinks from wines to aperitifs and soft drinks. We had a ‘soft drink flight’ which included a range of teas and cordials. Perfectly matched with the food and delicately flavoured.  Don’t hesitate for a special 3 hours experience

L'Enclume,50,Very good,"Set menu of 11 courses, although amuse bouche is also counted in 11. Every dish was excellent, as it should be in 3 star restaurant.  Wine list was on iPad, which usability is not optimal. I was asking a Jura white, which wouldn’t be heavily oaked. We got a good wine (135 £) which I considered heavily oaked. Not full points for sommelier then.  Service was relaxed and first class."

L'Enclume,50,Recommend for a special occasion,"Our first 3 Michelin star experience and well worth every penny. The restaurant is cosy with original features and the staff are very attentive. The food was fantastic.  We had the select wine pairing which was definitely worth doing - had the nicest sake I’ve had.    We stayed for 2 nights in a lovely comfortable room just next to Rogan and Co, comfortable bed, nice and quiet, and easy parking at the racecourse."

L'Enclume,50,Exceptional,"From the food to the service, the cutlery and place settings this is an exceptional experience. You certainly pay for it but it is worth the money for the whole experience. The food is superb and every one of the 15 different dishes was excellent. Many of them are works of art"

L'Enclume,50,Amazing experience,An outstanding meal with exceptional service and attention to detail. A thoroughly lovely experience which we will treasure. Thanks to all of the team.

L'Enclume,50,Great dining experience,"We booked to stay at L'Enclume for 2 nights for our 20th Wedding Anniversary. It definitely was a dining experience. Such a lovely place and everyone was so welcoming from the minute we arrived.  One negative - I felt we were pressurised when it came to deciding on wine etc. There was no chance to look at a wine/drinks list as we sat down. I explained that I didn't drink much and I would like to say when I was ready for a drink which was fine .My husband asked the sommelier to recommend some wines to go with some courses, however there was no price list to see. I was there for the culinary experience not the wine which seemed to take over at times.  Everything else was perfect. The food was a different experience and loved how everything is sourced and grown locally. Some courses we enjoyed more than others but with sixteen courses there is such a variety of food.  Staff were fantastic and loved watching them, it was like a theatre performance at times and all so well timed.  The whole weekend was fantastic and a great way to spend our anniversary. Definitely worth the experience.  Also loved the cutlery and plates, all the small things that make such a great experience."

L'Enclume,50,Otherworldly,"I’ve had to take a few days to think about this review because I don’t think I can ever find the right words to describe L’enclume. I booked this for my husbands birthday and as there’s certain things I wouldn’t eat I asked for a vegetarian option for me upon booking, absolutely no issues with this and they called me a couple of weeks beforehand to check dietary requirements.  Upon entering L’enclume, we received a very warm welcome. There was a real buzz about the place and I noticed straightaway that although busy, there were no other tables encroaching on your space. For some reason I always pay attention to the temperature and noted that it was very comfortable and just right. As soon as our bums hit the chairs the magic began! 15 course set tasting menu, the menu itself was sealed in an envelope and we could choose to view it or just let the experience guide as through.. we chose the latter. We chose the signature wine pairing and our sommelier was outstanding, very attentive without being intrusive and was very engaging. The team that handled our table were fantastic and very knowledgeable, very unpretentious and made us feel at ease, nothing was a problem to them.  So…..the food….I question if I can call it that because it wasn’t like anything I’d ever experienced before. Little intricate plates of absolutely punching flavours that showcased the local area in the best possible way. My vegetarian menu was not compromised in anyway and was full of flavour. There were only actually 3 or 4 courses that differed from the 2 menus.  The food was like edible artwork! Absolutely stunning, well thought out and otherworldly. I could go on and on and on but seriously, my words will never do this justice. The wine was exceptional. The service outstanding.  The interactions between the staff were discreet, just a gentle tap to let people know someone was passing behind them and on occasion a little bit of trickery! They all work seamlessly together without feeling rehearsed.  Highly recommend booking the accommodation as well as this was stunning! Lots of little rooms dotted about the village of Cartmel which in itself is beautiful and worth a visit.  If you’re sitting swithering about going to L’enclume…don’t. Book it and let yourself be taken on a food adventure."

L'Enclume,30,Ok,"Equisite food but perfunctory service and refused to accept Amex. Come on - even Aldi take Amex! It was ok, but I wouldn't rush back, 3 stars maybe but it felt like they've given up trying too hard."

L'Enclume,40,Decent enough but fell short.,"Really want to say this is perfect but it isn't or at least wasn't for us. Everything is pretty good, but it's natural to compare it to other experiences. We've been lucky to now go to 6 michelin starred restaurants. This was just about on a par food and service wise with a couple of 1 star restaurants we've been to in the Algarve, although their views are better (which I know michelin doesn't score). All the dishes are good or very good, but nothing stood out and so it disappointed a bit given our 3* expectations. I also found it a tad disappointing given where we were there was only 1 meat course. Appreciate that the menu will change with the seasons and we all have different tastes, so maybe on another evening we would go wow. Alas this time we just felt it was nice."

L'Enclume,50,Another wonderful visit,"This was our third visit to this fabulous restaurant. The first since they achieved a prestigious 3rd Michelin star    As ever, our dining experience did not disappoint. The food was delicious; exciting with surprising and delighting flavours. The other aspect of the dining experience at L’Enclume we love so much is its relaxed, friendly and unpretentious ambience and customer service whilst maintaining impeccable standards. The staff at L’Enclume from the restaurants to the accommodation are all fantastic and make you feel like a special guest throughout the entirety of your stay. They are also all so charming, warm and friendly.    We stayed in one of the guest rooms overnight in addition to dining in the restaurant. The room was clean, well presented and comfortable with some lovely touches included such as cookies from the kitchen. My only criticism and feedback would be that we found our room to be very noisy. We we staying directly above the Rogan and Co Bistro at the front of the reception building. Early evening when we were trying to relax before getting ready for dinner, there was loud music and shouting from the bistro below. We think it was the staff getting ready for the evening service. Similarly it was a little loud in the morning, when breakfast is served to guests in the bistro. If we stayed again we would make a point of requesting a room that wasn’t in this part of the building."

L'Enclume,50,Eight wonder of the world as an experience.,"Eighth wonder of the world in terms of experience, the history of each plate, its provenance from it's creation, the delivery of its service, was far beyond what I'd expected. Even at the £250 per person its one of those experiences that you are happy to pay for, if like me andyou like your food. The creativity of each dish with the backstory and effort gone into it should be put in little booklets so I can take that history home with me, I want to say I can remember each and every story but I can't I was that overawed with the whole experience.What a fantastic team , fantastic cooks and a big thank you for letting us watch your art as you painted it on the plate. True masters of your profession and the craft you displayed. The servers deliver that passion with the food repeatedly."

L'Enclume,50,"Probably 4.5 in reality, but the food is so good…","I can’t give any less than 5 stars as the food was genuinely incredible. Every dish was world class, although I can understand the few comments in other reviews about the level of salt - I quite like salty food though so enjoyed it. One or two of the dishes properly left us open mouthed with amazement.    We did find the service to be a little odd at times. They are clearly trying to get the junior chefs engage with the customers by delivering a script about some of the dishes, but when we tried to engage them in conversation about the food they seemed flustered and very keen to get back to the kitchen. The actual waiting staff also seem to engage with you at a kind of scripted level, and sometimes it felt a little weird and overwhelming.  We saw other tables being given chances to see the kitchen, but that opportunity wasn’t offered to us, which we felt was a shame as we love that kind of stuff.    Very minor gripes though, but at close to £1k for a night out it should be perfection."

L'Enclume,50,UNRIVALLED PERFECTION ACHIEVED,Only superlatives will do…    And there are not enough in the language to exalt this place…    The commitment to excellence is unparalleled anywhere …    The warmth and passion is unrivalled…    The choreography is steroidal…    But ABVOVE ALL IS THE FOOD…    Every mouthful is a WOW!!!    There is no standing still… new dishes today …    We introduced first timers to L Enclume today … highly discerning highly demanding friends… they were BLOWN AWAY!!!!    Forget the nay sayers… this place is for the living not the dead!    The score today was 11/10…    And as an ex teacher that is praise indeed….    We feel well placed to comment working as we do in hospitality..as does our friend paying the bill today … we all agreed… the non pareil in every respect…    This place is an oasis of pleasure and happiness…    What skills to bring so much pleasure in this increasingly gloomy world of mediocrity and disintegration…    Words are not really adequate……

L'Enclume,30,Nice but underwhelming,"My husband and I were so excited about coming to L'Enclume; it's a 3 Michelin Star restaurant that everyone raves about, and so when we got a booking we were over the moon.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations; the restaurant itself is nice and the staff and service were absolutely brilliant, but the food fell short. We were expecting to be blown away, but we really weren't. Everything was insanely salty, and there wasn't a single course that made us go ""wow"".  The menu is seasonal, so maybe the menu was below its usual standards, and the food was by no means unpleasant, but considering the hype and awards that this place has generated we were expecting more."

L'Enclume,50,A vortex of deliciouness,"This is a rock concert in the VIP area but the act is food  The staff are top of game and explain every dish.  Wifey and I thought every dish was splendid. This is food presented at another level. At three star mich, not sure what they can do to achieve and hit 4. No doubt for us Aussie travellers it's a big hit but how often will you eat 15 courses and have the surroundings and service at this mega level. Oh and to reach 16 courses I stopped at the shop up the road to add a sticky toffee pudding famous in the village. Cardiac arrest forthcoming but what the hell."

L'Enclume,50,Fabulous lunch,"Fabulous food fabulous wine fabulous staff , there for the tasting menu , more than a meal out the food and staff were the best"

L'Enclume,30,Not as expected ….,Interesting … some odd flavour combinations Wine and drinks service a little pushy Stayed over at the rooms linked to to restaurant - room was pleasant however breakfast included was underwhelming - never had cold devilled eggs with a cooked breakfast ?

L'Enclume,50,Mind blowing food and service,I've eaten in great places all over the globe including Michelin star restaurants. This was simply the best meal I have ever eaten and the service was also superb.

L'Enclume,50,Amazing experience,"Brilliant restaurant excellently overseen by Graham and his staff. Could not improve on anything, the food is out of this world."

L'Enclume,50,Fantastic birthday experience,"Me & 'er indoors went today for a birthday treat, I have to say it's absolutely worth the 3 stars! 15 courses spread perfectly over 4 hours, amazing staff, excellent wines - the full 6- nil. A return is on the cards"

L'Enclume,50,Been twice loved it both times.,Whats NOT been said about Leclume? We went with family 6 of us and got a side room which was really nice couldnt fault it at all. Yes its very expensive but that's what you get when you go for the best of the best.

L'Enclume,50,An experience beyond just dining,"This isn’t about food, it’s about art and passion and craft . The 16 course taster menu was incredible. I could identify the flavour of almost every ingredient, so beautifully crafted and presented    If the food was art , the service was theatre. Watching the staff glide about was pure choreography. The training here is at a different level, yet despite its emphasis on perfection, at its core it captures and uses the local culture of welcome and friendliness and being part of a community. What a clever vision .    Pile on top it’s dedication to local produce and L’Enclume has something very special beyond just dining. It embraces and celebrates its surroundings, heritage and producers In today’s soulless, corporate, citizen of nowhere hospitality it hasn’t intruded, it has become part of Cartmel and Cartmel part of it. It is a refuge"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Magical,"Everything about our experience was top class. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. Our sommelier was the best I've ever met. The wine choices were unique and interesting. The food was inventive, exquisite and of course, delicious. The tasting menu had such variety that each course was a wonderful surprise. I can't thank everyone enough for making our visit so magical."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Worth the rating,"It was a true Michelin 3 experience. Incredibly comfortable and inviting. The staff was warm, personable and very engaging. Absolutely no complaints."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,It Was Far More Than Dinner - It Was A Once In A Lifetime Experience!!!,"This was the greatest dining experience I’ve ever had. The atmosphere, service and food were absolutely fantastic. I was their for a birthday celebration and the Staff went far out of their way to make it a very special evening. We had the wine pairing with 7 course tasting menu and it was spectacular."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Nice :),Nicly done. Testing manu perfect with wone dinning - everybody should try this experience. We try this restaurant several times - always good :)

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,No competition. Sadly.,"No competition. Sadly.    I visit quite a lot of restaurants in London (and in Europe) from Bib to 3*. In brief, JP Blondet at Ducasse and his team on the floor are trading way above the competition here in London in their category, at the moment. For ex. was at a world’s famous 3* restaurant a few weeks ago in Chelsea, and it just is not “boxing in the same category”.    Some 3* should secretly visit this Dorchester “auberge” and see what’s like to make a client feel so at ease/comfortable you just do not want to leave either because of the cuisine or because the staff is so professional (they have a new RM, a young, very pro and may I say, very attractive lady!).    With prices so high now in London (funny how 1* restaurants are now roughly GPB 100+, 2* GBP 200 and 3* GBP 300 excl. wines), those restaurants better be not just good but excellent, out of this world.    An example? I had a coffee/cream-based desert in my 3*Chelsea restaurant in early July, the type of desert that it is easy to prepare well ahead of customers coming at 1815. Yep! 1815! No choice! Who wants a coffee/creamy based desert on a hot Saturday of July? Seasons? Who cares? What are they going to serve in November? Even the Ritz changed their excellent souffle to adapt to the current season! But a 3* In Chelsea ? No!!! Who the pastry chef works for? Customers? 😊 You must be joking! They should be so lucky to have the privilege to dine in our restaurant I hear them saying….    Do those restaurants think they can keep on charging those prices with those practices and keep their ratings….?    So yes I am not going to continue to pay GBP 300 for a restaurant whose staff on the floor and in the kitchen are working for themselves instead of working for clients like in this Chelsea-based eatery.    Here I had a cherry-based desert and my friend a strawberry. Seasons fruits. Season deserts. Yes more risks of wasting fragile strawberries or cherries… No risk of wasting coffee beans true…..Your P&L is safe...    The cuisine here is innovative, I tasted some excellent langoustines in a cold consommé, a Scottish wagyu beef with a great jus, highly refined and highly technical in my view etc…    Prices have gone up and now dining in London is really expensive. Some restaurants will be able to stay competitive. That’s the case here. Not certain for many restaurants. I am not very optimistic for those high end restaurants that require customers to come on Saturday eve a 0615, and be out by 0930 whilst serving dishes that are so “ready-to-serve” by the Kitchen/floor staff so they can get out and have their evening for “only” GBP 500 per head inc. VAT… Well no thank you.    Again not the case here.    Not cheap but thankfully, here you could almost say this is great value for money. Almost! 😊"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,"Recommend, however…","Having dined here before we were looking forward to another wonderful experience with a journey through amazing creative culinary delights and impeccable service that you would would expect from a three star. However the sparkle is not quite as it once was, the food was delicious and beautifully prepared but a little lacking in creativity and the service was not three star attentive service from all the front of house (some training issue’s possibly?). I have eaten more creative food and had far more attentive service at Sketch and Helene Darroze. Wine pairings and non alcoholic pairings with the tasting menu were also not mentioned at all which was rather odd? Overall the whole experience felt a little lacklustre and lacking that three star experience you would expect. Maybe an off night with new staff but at that level there should not be any off nights!!"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,:A Gracious Evening Marred by A Few Glittering Missteps,"The occasion of my birthday guided us to grace the opulent interiors of a restaurant which we’ve had the privilege to experience before. In its magnificent splendour and culinary prowess, it had previously managed to leave us awestruck, an experience that etched a permanent memory in our hearts. This visit, while mostly splendid, revealed a subtle diminution in its previously undoubted sparkle and grandeur.    The fare, it must be said, remained as exceptional as ever, a testament to the culinary maestros behind the scenes. Each dish was a cornucopia of flavours, an exploration of the delicate artistry that has rightly earned this establishment its coveted place among the top 3 Michelin-starred restaurants globally.    However, certain unexpected glitches did mildly tarnish our evening. Upon expressing my preference for a teetotal evening, my wife duly requested a non-alcoholic cocktail menu for me. To our dismay, this detail, as seemingly insignificant as it may be for some, was overlooked. Inexplicably, this led to an all-encompassing assumption that our table had opted for an abstemious evening. Despite my wife’s order of a Campari and soda from another steward, the concept of wine pairings was not broached thereafter.    A redeeming feature was the delightful young lady who enthusiastically explained the intricacies of the tasting menu. Her insightful knowledge, coupled with her keen willingness to accommodate my daughter’s dietary needs, was a refreshing example of attentive service.    In the spirit of the occasion, I elected to adorn my dishes with black truffles, an additional indulgence I was keen to treat myself to. Regrettably, this augmentation was overlooked, resulting in an absence of the anticipated truffle infusion.    In summation, while our visit was generally delightful, it lacked the breathtaking ‘wow’ factor we had come to associate with this prestigious establishment. Regardless, we remain hopeful that future visits will recapture the immaculate brilliance and meticulous attention to detail that this esteemed restaurant is renowned for."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Amazing,"Having dined previously at other 3 and 2 starred restaurants (eg Helene Darozze, Gordan Ramsay, Waterside Inn) my wife and I both agreed that this was the best by far in terms of food and service. Obviously at a price but you know the drill when you book here…"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Unbelievable Experience,"Absolutely superb! The decor and the food and the service were just Alain Ducasse again, proved his exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey! The waiters were very polite and descriptive in their food presentation. The staff were all smiles and made us feel very special. It was a very special dinning experience in Monaco."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,Return visit… good but lacking full 3 Michelin star finesse,"I’ve always felt that AD@Dorchester has been underrated in London - it’s consistently had 3 Michelin stars for an exceptionally long time and is relatively easy to find a table at. However my most recent visit was ever so slightly disappointing. Objectively, a great dinner - we had the full tasting with the top wine flight pairings - but there were too many imperfections for this to really be 3 Michelin stars. Small things like sloppily placed cutlery, inconsistent table service and long waits for attention - not a huge deal, and certainly first world problems, but all added to a sense that the restaurant was lacking that ultimate polish. Feels more like a place to go for fine dining tourists and instagrammers. Having said that, my wife and I both enjoyed the meal."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Great dinner and outstanding service,A lovely dinner with the tasting menu and wine pairings. It does last a long time (4 hours) but it was filled with creative food and great service. their communications pre arrival helped with one in our group who had a food allergy. great restaurant

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,30,Where did everyone go?,"I took my wife here to celebrate our 46 th Wedding Anniversary while in town for the Chelsea Flower Show. The initial meal and service was as one would expect but then everyone disappeared! we were seated near the street in an area away from the main dining room with two significant pillars blocking the view but with 3 other tables sharing the space. After finishing our mains, we sat for 35 minutes awaiting clearance of dishes and desert menus. We finally succeeded in signaling for the bill. While I can appreciate that some restaurants struggle with staffing, this clearly was not the issue here. There was plenty of staff but the pillars block their view of these tables and as the restaurant was nearly full their attention drifted away from us. A sad and disappointing end to what started out well but petered out dismally. What a shame."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Truly exceptional ♥️,"Quality and service which you would expect at a three Michelin star restaurant. A wonderful culinary journey from start to end - dishes served at the start had clean and refreshing flavours, followed on with bold, meaty flavours. Ended with cheese course and a beautiful sorbet dessert. At the end of the service, my partner was given a chocolate gift, very thoughtful!    It was the perfect place to celebrate a special birthday."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,10,Poor service,"I visited Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester for my birthday with my wife. We had the tasting menu and the food was exquisite apart for the fish that wasn't anything special nor tasty. We very much enjoyed the medallion lobster, the scallop and the he venison.    The service however was a big let down for a 3-stars Michelin restaurant. We had a glass of champagne when we sat and the sommelier put maybe 50ml in my wife's glass while my glass was filled normally. I never saw that in any restaurant in the world, regardless of their price or how many Michelin stars they have. That was a bad way to start the diner and spoiled a bit the good feel factor of the arrival. The total bill for 2 tasting menus, 2 glasses of champagne at the beginning and half-bottle champagne during the diner was £561.    When we left and got our jackets, I noticed my Louis Vuitton pin wasn't on my jacket anymore. I told the staff and they started looking on the floor for it. I ended up finding it after a while, but not the whole pin, the back was still missing. That was rather annoying to see. I was told they are going to keep looking for it and that I would be contacted. I wasn't and after some days I got in touch with them. At first they were dismissive and when I told them I'm not happy with the way they're treating this a manager then called me. They told me they're still looking for the back part but I'm not expecting it to find it.    To spend above £500 on a diner and then to be disrespected I find unpardonable. I'm not going back there again."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Exceptional meal,We booked this restaurant as a double birthday celebration and our first three star michelin restaurant. We were not disappointed quite simply the best meal I have ever eaten. We picked the tasting menu with a wine flight and when the first course came out I knew we were going to be in for a beautiful meal. The lobster dish was stunning and the wine choices complimented the food. The real highlight was getting to go into the kitchen and meet Jean- Philippe the executive chef.    Worth every penny and I'm so glad we picked here for our first three star meal.

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Simply world-class!,"This was a perfect eveing from the start to the end! First of all the service and ambience is perfect - from the first interaction at the entrace all through the evening! Friendly, super professional, knowledgable and yet a little nice ”french formal” service to...More"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,20,Very bad booking experience (for a £610 restaurant gift voucher),Rarely do I find the time to write a review so it has to be about an extraordinarily good or bad experience. I contacted the reservation team for Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester on Wednesday evening as I wanted to offer a gift certificate for...More

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,30,Food just not 'wow',"Service is very attentive, surroundings are nice, but this very formal restaurant just didn't deliver on food. In terms of taste to value- I have eaten in many better restaurants. Presentation OK but not as good as Core by Clare Smyth for example"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,10,AVOID AVOID!!,Birthday celebration ruined! Staff were professional albeit too fast and production-line style. Food was meagre and fluffed up to sound huge when it was tiny and not great tasting. Wines overpriced and again small amounts despite charging up to £500 extra per person for the pairing. We had to hunt around the tiny mains sauces to find the lamb chop which was even smaller than a 50p coin. Bread was given out sparingly and we had to ask for more - small slice by slice portions. They had extensive works going on and we could not enter at the main door but walk all round the corner in our formal outfits. One couldn't even access the tiny ballroom toilets without being escorted a long way to avoid the dusty works. Definitely over-hyped place - I don't know how they get 5 stars; makes me suspicious! Also it was my birthday and I was astonished to see the very tiny dessert course which everyone was given but mine had a small candle on it! And the well-advertised chef's tour for birthdays never materialised. Thanks for a wonderful birthday celebration -NOT!!

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Absolutely stunning,"Arrived at agreed time to be greeted by an extremely friendly girl on reception, coats taken and shown to our table from there on in everything was faultless from knowledge by the waiters on every course from where every ingredient was sourced to the cooking process and story behind each dish. We had the 7 course taster menu and every single dish was superb, star of the show being the rack of lamb and the lobster raviolis . We had a bottle of lovely 2014 Barolo which was superb. We would highly recommend a visit as we were very very impressed indeed. Good job Alain ducasse at the dorchester"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Wonderful subtle flavours,Went for the 7 course taster. Delicious but subtle flavours. Something for the connoisseur. For me the best course was the John Dory fish but the lobster was good as well. Had the middle grade flight of wine which was beautifully balanced with each dish and they allowed one glass between two.  Very attentive staff who were very knowledgeable and friendly.  A nice touch was that we were taken to the kitchen to meet the head chef Jean-Phillipe Blondet who was very friendly.

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Worth a trip to London anytime !,"The Dorchester entrance is a time machine as you enter you feel you’re in a different age, the corridors the decoration and art on the walls is just from another century quite eye catching. Then you enter the restaurant which is a mixture in between that and modernity so well designed and paired. You need food to be up to all that luxury and the Chefs do not disappoint the food is fantastic. Then you have a ballet in the service directed by Enrico is just incredible how they managed to master their craft and execute an impecable service with a full restaurant."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,"the man, the myth, the place to dine","the worlds greatest chef, our favourite uk place to dine, service impecable, food first rate, selection of wines breathtaking first class in every sense, but need to get the set lunch menu back on ???? its amazing value, which we had once, but usually dinner we take"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Late birthday celebration,I was treated to the exceptional and totally delicious Jardin menu with each course a very beautiful and totally delicious wonder that kept raising the quality and brought delight to my taste buds.  The staff were excellent being attentive and providing information on the food and much much more.  I am so happy and impressed with everything this restaurant has to offer - I was even invited to meet the chef! A real pleasure….thank you so much 😊

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Wow,"Our third visit in London but not for some time and definitely not the last, and not just in UK. Faultless food and experience. We had the tasting menu but a special note goes to our wine waiter with whom we exchanged some interesting notes throughout the meal."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,One of our best meals in London!,"My fiance took me here for my birthday and we had the lunch menu and we both had a really nice experience. The service was excellent to begin with. We told them we do not take alcohol and they were very acccomodating and informed us which dishes are suitable for our diet. They also replaced the wines with Non-alcoholic tea juices.    We had the flower garden, coco bean soup for starters and I had the pollock and my fiance had the duck breast for mains. Amuse bouche was delicious, our 3 courses were of decent size and when dessert came we were both so full up we were trying so hard to finish our dessert. Oops I forgot to mention I think we had a lot of bread before that as the bread and butter was delicious!    For 3 course for £70, it was definitely worth it. I'm not sure if the restaurant still does this lunch menu but if they do it's definitely a must try!"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,"Delicious food with an extensive menu, not so keen on the service","Extensive menu including an a la carte option with variety of flavours and textures. Food is easily the best thing about this restaurant and is worth the money. The meals are cleverly put together and the entire menu is an experience.    The decor and overall atmosphere is more relaxed than I expected which is refreshing. Its a very calm place to eat and you're given space and time to enjoy your meal.    The only thing that let this place down was the service. I don't know if the restaurant was just short-staffed on the day I attended, but it felt like everyone was rushed off their feet. I really wanted to learn more about the dishes but the staff were very eager to leave once they had presented each dish, looking around while they were talking to you and rushing away before you could say anything. Everyone was running around and you could tell that you were holding them up by asking questions which made me reluctant to engage more with the menu and dishes (isn't that part of the entire 'fine dining experience'?). I ended up leaving early because I just felt I wasn't getting much aside from a nice meal and felt I was getting in the way.    Judging by the rest of the reviews this does just seem to be a one-off experience and I'm looking forward to returning in the near future to hopefully a more pleasant meal. Despite this, I would recommend this restaurant for those interested in a unique culinary experience."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Seasons in the Sun as the song goes,"Not been since December I believe. Many changes on the floor with an excellent new RM, truly excellent. The staff is smiling, and genuinely so, not faking it which is so important in a restaurant. We all have our pbs, especially nowadays and a smile may not change the world but a nice evening. En cuisine, also big changes, took a long menu, much more refined than before, over the years, excellent sauces, jus, cuissons, highly refined would be my world. Nice visuals. One suggestion, know it costs but each dish would be so much more nicely presented with a sous-assiette. It changes everything imo. The less is more is so 1990's... Obviously, not everything I agree with but that's my taste like a brioche there, a bouillon, the choice of a fish (when I taste a dish, I try to taste the ingredients separately and then together when possible). Here they respect the seasons for the vegetables, the fish (there is a book that all chefs should have on their shelf and know by heart: Les saisons de l'océan de Christopher Coutanceau ). You think all 3* or even 2* restaurants do that and respect seasons and sustainability? Well i had a pea puree a few weeks ago in a 2* for ex.... And when you have game all year long in a 3* restaurant , even if it is d'elevage? No! Seasons were invented so we can appreciate the season's products AT THEIR BEST not when they are AVAILABLE. It is not because you can get it, source it from a supplier anywhere in the world, that you should serve it. We can all get cherries in December in London. Is that the right thing to do? There is a dish with a mini souffle -would have sworn double cuisson but it is not, a little bit like a la Suissesse/Gavroche) with yellow wine and truffles. A killing we say in French. I can imagine one day they will serve a real souffle, light and elegant like a small isolated cloud in a summer sky with hints of yellow wine, truffles, and aged Comte..... But maybe they don't know how to do it...? :)! They probably don't...! :) That would be a classic 3* dish imo. Yesterday was maybe one of the best meals I had in this restaurant. At the moment, this team in the kitchen and on the floor is at its best. Let's hope they don't lose focus. The hotel is under restoration, there is a corridor to go to the men's room. A suggestion: a few decorative print sets hanging on the curtains would make it less ""chantier-like"". Just an idea. The wine list is on the expensive and difficult side. My own choice of wine yesterday was not great. My fault but the wine list is the weak point of this restaurant."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester still Towers over London,"Recently, upon visiting my son, a student at Imperial College, I chose to delight him at Alain Ducasse. We were not disappointed. HIGHLIGHTS: both ordering the tasting menu, the Jerusalem artichokes with Kristal caviar cream simply melted in your mouth; the lobster medallion, chicken quenelles and Périgord truffle with semolina pasta was flavorful and nicely balanced; turbot, salsify, razor clams and black garlic, parsley, ripe tomatoes, and citrus was delicious, subtlety sour and sweet, allowing the flavor of the turbot to ascend; ending with a fabulous pineapple, galanga sorbet, the latter of which mostly found in Thai cuisine – citrusy with hints of pine. The BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT, however, was being invited into the kitchen to meet Executive Chef Jean-Philippe Blondet himself, who was incredibly gracious. Service was world-class with kudos to Mattia Marcelli and his superb staff. No doubt we'll be back."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,10,Birthday dinner,"This restaurant is rated very high as it has 3 Michelin Stars.  Unfortunately I found it very disappointing the food was so average, I expected flavours to burst in your mouth in fact it was the opposite. I wouldn’t recommend this restaurant to anyone. The bill was 1,500. We were 4 people.  Spend your money anywhere but here.  Jackie"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Exceptional,Service was mind blowing.great food and wine narratives from all staff ..staff mostly Italian .great balance between attentiveness v interference..pricing on the taster menu s was earth shattering but worth it.the renovations around the hotel made access a bit long winded but the overall expert exceeded our expectations

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,3 Michelin stars at its best.,"From the minute we entered we were met with world class service, we all chose the tasting menu and it did not disappoint, everything was excellent. My personal favourite was the cauliflower soufflé but the Lobster was up there as was the beef. The wine tasting is also a must if you enjoy wine, there is a choice if three different pairings with the first at £100, second £210 and £500. We had the second which again was as good as the food it was paired with."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Exceptional evening celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary.,"What I can say, what an evening. We both had the 7 course taster menu.    Every course served just got better and better as the evening progressed. The waiters knowledge of the food and its provenance was incredibly impressed.    The Sommelier knowledge of the wines was amazing and to have an opportunity to visit Jean Phillipe Blondel in the kitchen made our evening.    For me/us a once in a life time experience made memorable by every member of staff in the restaurant.    Absolutely stunning evening, thoroughly recommended, well done guys 🥂👏👏👏👏"

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Perfect birthday dinner,"Great food and service. Portions were larger than average for a Michelin-starred restaurant, so make sure you're very hungry when you arrive! We were well stuffed by the end of the meal, but very happy."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Beautiful Lunch,The incredible experience starts from the minute you walk into the restaurant. The staff are just amazing and so welcoming. They also look incredible with specially designed uniforms.  The food is delicious and there are extra treats thrown in along the way.  If you get the chance to do the rum baba then that’s a must! I’m so glad we made it a stop on our trip to London.

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,Splendid service,"The service and various staff (Nicolas, Cecelia and Roberto) made this dining experience. While not all the flavours ( prawns three ways) of the various dishes were my preference, the expertise and finesse in plating and cooking were ever worthy of its three stars. Highlights were the steadfast lobster dish and desserts."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,Fell a bit short,"I hesitated to write this review initially because it would’ve been less than a rave, and I have little patience with unhinged rants about restaurants, but I received a prompt from this site, and my wife encouraged me to share my thoughts that might be helpful to others. Let me begin by saying that we have been to numerous Michelin starred restaurants and about a dozen three star ones. They are not uniformly fabulous. To me, a Michelin three star experience is one where we are made to feel like valued guests in one’s home. They are not stuffy or pretentious but inviting and entertaining. We recently spent four nights in London and on consecutive nights we visited two Michelin 3 stars. The other was a nearby similarly decorated and similarly located in a 5 star hotel and named after the French executive chef. This one was significantly less satisfying.    A Michelin 3 is not just about the food, but is more about the experience. I don’t really have any comments about the food. It tasted good, was inventive, and well presented. My comments are about the environment, the experience, and the wine service. As mentioned, I hesitated to write this because I saw no real upside. I am not looking for a free dessert coupon. I apologize that my comments are a little vague and non detailed. It has been about three weeks, and I did not intend to provide a review.    My first comment is that I cannot recall a Michelin 3 without tablecloths. You may dismiss me as an ancient traditionalist, and that may be fair, but I think that their absence might have contributed to the noise and casualness that detracted from the experience. Similarly, there were at least two diners in T shirts, jeans, and athletic shoes. The shirts were not fitted Ts but were stretched out, bacon necked, white shirts more like undershirts and suitable for yard work. Again, I am not so old or rigid that they actually offended me, but I do think again that it was reflective of the noise and casualness that detracted from the experience. Let me try to explain.    The wine staff and wait staff were uniformly pleasant and personable. They also all spoke good English even if it not appear to be their primary language. I like to engage the staff and ask them to explain an ingredient, unfamiliar food term, or maybe the varietal of the wine. There presentations seemed just a bit rushed, and I often had difficulty hearing them because of the ambient noise. I wanted to ask questions after almost every presentation. It was difficult to do that or hear; so I soon gave up.    We were once in a Michelin 3 restaurant that shortly thereafter lost its third star because of the impression that there were two tiers of service. If you were not among the targeted clientele of hedge fund or private equity mavens, you received a lower level of service. I really don’t think that was the issue here. We did order the five course tasting menu with wine pairings. We often do that in hopes of seeing the range of the kitchen and discovering some inventive pairings. I once was told that the pairings menu was for tourists and did not display what the kitchen could do. Perhaps the pairings menu was a mistake in retrospect. Let me try to explain.    There were two upcharges on the tasting menu, 85 pounds for the caviar substitute over the tuna carpaccio and 150 pounds for the Waygu beef. Admittedly, we did not order either, and I did not see the Waygu, but I doubt we are talking tomahawk ribeye. It was most likely a two oz. portion substitute for the poultry selection. I don’t remember if that was pigeon, squab, or quail. Unfortunately my wife doesn’t really like any of those so we are starting off on the wrong foot. That’s why I made the comment about tiers of service. I would’ve preferred those choices on a separate tasting than feeling like I had selected a lesser menu. As I said, I might’ve been better off with an ala carte menu.    As I said earlier, my comments about the food are minimal. No complaints. I reserve most of my comments about the wine service. I was presented the wine list. I turned to the old world red section since I am most familiar with those wines. Many of the selections were older vintages ,many in the 2000-2500 pound range. We typically drink wines in the 100-300 range. That was more than I was interested in spending. I inquired about pairings. I was told that they were not in the wine list but on the menu. The menu had three tiers of pairings. The descriptions were vague and somewhat non specific. I think the names were something like prestige, classic, or something else. I chose the mid priced tier. Most of my concerns were quantitative not qualitative. The servers poured a short pour with pipette like precision to the lower part of the wide part of the glass. I don’t know if it was 50 ml or 2 oz but it seemed skimpy. The wine pairings were served 3-5 mins before the food course. I would reflexively taste the wine when served, so consequently there was little to savor with the dish. These were not Grand Cru wines. They were from secondary appellations like Slovakia, Hungary, Pouilly Fume and maybe Australia. The quality was not bad but I didn’t think they were at a price point that required such a meager pour. I think that was my biggest complaint with the restaurant."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,30,Confusingly disappointing,"It has been a long while since my experience at the Darroze's, and normally I don't like to leave negative feedback publicly but... there is simply no excuse for such disappointing experience. This was a weekend lunch with their famous set-menu. It's not everyday that one goes to a three-star Michelin restaurant, and it should have been memorable. I do remember the exquisite flavour of the butter, and a lovely seeded bread, which made us excited for what was to come. Unfortunately, everything else after that is just a blur of nicely presented mediocre flavours -- one of the main dishes simply unpleasant. After about a week none of us could remember exactly what we had, except for the sheer disappointment (and surprise) that this lunch was served by a restaurant awarded with the highest accolade in fine dining. It simply cannot be compared to other experiences at a three-stars, not even in one star, to be honest. The ambience is very nice and service impeccable, but at £250 a head perhaps it's the minimum to be offered."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,8/10,"8/10 overall  location in Mayfair fancy, interior stunning, very comfortable and spacious seating. Flawless service, all members of the team were professional, warm and polite. The only tiny issue was needing to ask for our water to be refilled a couple of times. I think some of the dishes were objectively excellent but not to my taste, as my friends thoroughly enjoyed the meal. My friend got the non-alcoholic drinks pairing which he said was amazing. We also received a few complimentary dishes from the chef including an amuse-bouche 9/10, and a pastry dessert 7/10. The starting consommé was delicious (ginger, carrot and smokey notes). I got the organic kombucha and it was a VERY tiny glass of 75ml    Autumn menu £215pp:  Bluefin tuna 9/10  Tomato 6/10  lobster 6/10  sweetbread 4/10  turbot 10/10  pigeon 6/10  apricot 10/10  chocolate 10/10    £960 for 3 people. The pricing seems quite fair all things considered."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Another wonderful dinner,Hélène Darroze at the Connaught is one of our favorite restaurants in London. We had the chance to have another wonderful dinner with our son and everything was perfect as usual- food is fabulous and service very professional and friendly. We had the wine pairing with the “around the world “ suggestions and tasted some very nice wines such as a Greek white from Santorrini. The “baba” dessert is my all time favorite with Armagnac from Hélène’s family  We are already looking forward to go back when we are in London next!

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,3 stars and totally deserved!,We visited Helene Darroze for my birthday during our stay at the Connaught Hotel on Saturday 1st July. Every single dish was sensational as expected from a 3 star restaurant. No stone was unturned in making this the most magical experience for my birthday. They even took a Polaroid photo of us at the table and put it in a card as a souvenir. Menus were personalised for us. The food was unbelievable. The wagyu beef my husband had was truly a phenomenal experience for him. The Armagnac soaked baba was the absolute highlight for me and I would encourage everyone to try this spectacular dessert. Service was exemplary as would be expected. Faultless experience overall. Amazing canele to take home with us too which we enjoyed in our room afterwards!

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,20,Grossly Overpriced and Not Worth the 3 Star Michelin,"Being “Foodies” and having eaten at 3 star michelin restaurants and hotels all over the world. It was with great anticipation that we arrived in London and invited two of our dear friends who are also “foodies” to enjoy an evening of what we thought would be exceptional food.  The menu was the “Summer Menu’ which was presented and it offered a pre-set of 7 courses or 5. All of us agreed that 5 courses would be enough.  There followed after that some three types of “Amuse Bouche”, which indeed got the palette prepared for what we thought would be a “gastronomical” delight to follow.  The five courses that followed were to say the least mediocre at best and not up to what I would consider “3” star Michelin acceptance.  On a separate note, our waiters who served the food, had a very basic understanding of English, and it was indeed very difficult for us to ascertain what they were describing on the food being served. It was embarrassing for them as well as us when we had to continue to ask them to repeat what they had just said.    The highlight of the evening was the Sommelier who not only had an excellent sense of humour, but a vast knowledge of the wine menu.    This was an extremely disappointing evening, and I would not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends, or would I ever frequent it again.  There are many more restaurants in London, who are more deserving of a three star Michelin title."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Another very enjoyable dining experience.,"Visiting The Connaught a few times a year, a stay is not quite complete without lunch or dinner at HD.    As with previous visits, service was flawless - friendly and attentive whilst not overbearing. With prior notice the restaurant competently manage dietary and allergy requirements.    The vegetarian 7 course tasting menu was very tasty, and the wine pairing excellent. A minor constructive item of feedback - it would be nice to see a deviation from a risotto based main (which as a regular guest is a little too predictable)… perhaps a couple more smaller courses instead of the very generous sized main and dessert."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,An absolute must,"There seems to be a few mixed reviews for Helene Darroze, most focussing on the cost and if it is worth it. The simple answer from our experience is that for a 3 Michelin Star Restuarant it is actually good value and the whole experience was superb.    It has been a few years since we last ate here and we very much enjoyed the experience that time, this time was even better. We did the 8 course tasting menu which was the perfect choice.    The portion size was actually larger than you would generally expect, but because of the way the menu is balanced while ending up full, you don'd up to full. At the end when the final course arrives, simply called Chocolate I did wonder but its a testimant to the dish that actually it was the perfect end to the meal. It is somehow hot, cold, soft & crunchy all in a punchy chocolate dish that in no way was sickly, how they do it I have no idea!    Prior to that and early in the meal the ""Onion"" course was so unusual, almost comfort food but done in a way that is worthy of the experience. To be fair however the entire menu is very well balanced and with a few surprises, as you would expect at Helene Darroze.    The service was excellent, not pretensious but very professional at the same time. The only slight issue being at the end, it was tricky to get the coffee and the bill as everyone had vanished, equally its nice they do not try and rush you out!    We would highly recommend Helene Darroze and will most certainly be returning."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,10,Questionable business with subpar food,"Spent £350 having lunch alone at this establishment and the experience was forgettable at best.  For context, I was a tourist visiting and due to work reasons had to delay my trip by a day, thus would miss my original Friday 8:30pm reservation for 2 people. I informed the restaurant 43hrs prior, missing their 48hr cancellation limit. In my email I said I would try my best to work with any availability over the 5-day window I was in London, but would appreciate if they could make an exception and cancel the res, knowing that someone would snap up my Friday night table the second they released it. They responded with a screenshot of a £350 cancellation fee receipt (yes, they went ahead and charged the full cancellation fee 2 days before my scheduled res), and offered me a Tuesday lunch spot where I could use the £350 as credit. It was unlikely that I’d find someone to join me for a 2-hr workday lunch, so I asked to be on the waitlist for all dinners over the 5 days. They said that would be impossible as all waiting lists were very long at that point, which again just confirmed my assumption that they’d have no problem filling my table and just wanted to make some extra cash. I asked if I could keep the credit for my next trip to London, potentially in 3-4 months, but they would only honour the credit for the 5 days I was in London.  So in the end I went for lunch alone pretty disgruntled but still hoping that perhaps the food would amaze me. I upgraded to premium ingredients wherever available to fill my budget. Unfortunately, the food was disappointing and I couldn’t even finish the amuse bouche, which was a first for me. Some dishes were ok, but pretty forgettable overall and definitely not worth the price. I’ve dined at many 3* Michelins in the US & Asia and I would say the food probably warrants a 1* and potentially another half star for ambiance.  I decided to keep the experience to myself as I wasn’t sure if I was being totally objective given the fiasco with the booking, but after genuinely enjoying the flight meal better on my return flight I thought maybe it was truly just a bad experience at a subpar place."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,10,Upsetting experience - easily the worst Michelin experience we’ve ever had,"What has happened to the Michelin rating system? How this place got three stars is beyond me; my mom and I like to make sure we visit all the three star restaurants and we simply do not understand how this restaurant can be considered anywhere near the same calibre as The Fat Duck, Core, L’Enclume, etc??!! Even the two star restaurants we’ve been to have been far better - Midsummer House, Pollen Street Social, Marcus Wareing…. All have two stars but are far better places to eat (to name just a few).    Firstly, the food was bad. We had a late lunch sitting and I don’t think they made all of the food fresh - if you’re one of the last in a session, I suspect your food hangs around. The reason we thought this was because there were a lot of soft and chewy textures which I think should have been crunchy but because the dishes had sat around - the crunch had gone. We weren’t the only people to notice. All of the courses looked pretty/fussy but they were not delicious. We paid a £115 supplement to have the Wagyu beef course - which just ended up being another disappointment; the beef was so dry (photo included) that we didn’t eat it, certainly not worth the supplement. I’ve had better steaks for £6 from Wetherspoons.    However, the real killer was the service. My mom is a dialysis patient which means she can only have a limited amount of fluid per day. She can’t drink a whole flight of wine but likes to have a sip of the pairings to taste them with the food. We explained this to the restaurant when making the booking and asked if it would be ok to share a flight of wine - they said it would be fine and said they would provide two glasses with each wine pairing. When we got there, the waiter was unaware of this and said there was no way we could share a flight of wine - we asked if we could have ONE clean wine glass for the whole meal, so that I could pour a little mouthful of wine in my mom’s glass for her as each pairing came out and again, the waiter refused. I honestly felt like crying at this point, the waiter was so rude and brusque with us - it’s not like we were trying to be cheap - my mom is literally limited to a couple of glasses of fluid per day - she simply cannot drink multiple glasses of wine and two flights of wine is excessive when only one person is drinking. If they didn’t want to cater for her - why not just say that on the phone to us when booking; instead of embarrassing us at the table after we’ve arrived? When paying £500 a head - one single clean wine glass doesn’t seem like too much to ask. When we’ve been to other 3* Michelin restaurants they literally bent over backwards to accommodate her disability.    The cup fiasco doesn’t end there - at the end of our meal I had a coffee and we moved out to the terrace whilst settling the bill - our waiter said “shall I put your coffee in a paper cup for you?”; I said I was fine with the ceramic cup and then he said “but the cup is very expensive”. They can’t be serious?! We were not leaving the premises, is it unreasonable to want to drink the coffee from a ceramic cup when paying over £1000 for a meal for two? By the end of the meal, we just wanted to cry, normally places like this are renowned for good service and we leave feeling cared for and uplifted - but here, we left feeling berated and insulted. It was upsetting.    As for the price - trip advisor says the price range is between £75 and £175 - I’ve no idea how they came up with that range but I don’t think it’s realistic. Our bill came to over £500 per head and only one of us had the flight of wines. If you want to enjoy yourself and have table water, coffee and wine, etc, you can easily expect the bill to be £500-600+ per head. I think this is fair for exceptional food and service but you won’t find either of those here, which makes it overpriced.    On the positive side, the restaurant itself had a nice ambience, chairs were comfortable and the temperature was pleasing."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,30,Not worth it,"I was so excited for this visit (having only been to a restaurant with more than one Michelin star once before but it being possibly the best overall restaurant experience I've ever had) but wound up a bit disappointed and questioning the Michelin guide after having several disappointing one (and now two/three after this vacation) star experiences over the last year. There is no doubt the food is good and it's elegantly presented and the meat is impeccably cooked. But nothing I tasted felt ""new"" or made me ""wow,"" which, given the final costs, I'd definitely have expected. The restaurant also didn't do a good job of disclosing costs. If you've been to upscale restaurants, you know that they often include additional small plates, a welcome glass of champagne, etc...My husband chose to accept a glass of champagne when we were seated from a man with a champagne cart, and we were later charged 40 euros for it. If you asked me if the experience was worth it, I'd say no. I believe our money could have been better spent at other experiences elsewhere."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Outstanding Front of House Team,"Lovely food and truly exceptional service. The front of house team went above and beyond to make our meal memorable.    We were treated to a tour of the kitchens and a number of unexpected touches and goodies, all personalised with bits of information they'd garnered by talking to us throughout the meal."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,10,Hidden costs are shocking,I went with my partner after seeing the tasting menu on their website is £215 each. As I am pregnant I was not drinking alcohol and just had water. My partner had two beers. The final bill came to £900. I don’t understand how a service charge and two beers have amounted to £500. As well as this the food was very average. And the desserts were ruined by the excessive brandy and ginger added to them. Very disappointing and overpriced.

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,Great food - let down by the wine service,We have eaten here a couple of times and decided to book for New Year’s Eve and stay at The Connaught too - see my separate review.    Good evening overall and the food was excellent. The service not quite as usual - especially the wine service - maybe because it was NYE. We chose the premium wine flights to accompany the tasting menu not cheap - but sadly the experience was poor - the wines were supplied via the Coravin system and sprayed into the glass - which neither feels like a quality experience nor looks like a quality experience. One of the wine parings supplied in this way also had an amount of sediment.    We noted this with the wine waiter (sommelier) at the time.    We also spoke to the restaurant manager after the event - they agreed about the Coravin system. So until they have another method is in place perhaps not a great experience to order premium wines by the glass!

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Luxury Dining,Incredible food  Fake accent on waiter but well  Worth the money  Must dine in London !  Make reservations though  Service impeccable

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,Great experience,"The restaurant is one of London’s most recent promotions to a 3rd Michelin Star. Located in the Connaught hotel the restaurant is having a cocooning interior with blush shades, curved lines and very comfortable velvet and leather seating, proposing an exciting contemporary French cuisine. Creativity, meticulous attention to details and a pairing of classical skills with cutting edge techniques applied to high quality ingredients have produced show-stopping dishes. Service was impeccable, welcoming, courteous, professional without being stiff or condescending. Now, weather it is really on pair with a other 3 stars i have visited, is debatable but it compares very well with London’s standard."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Fine dining at its best,"Great fine dining experience.  The service was welcoming and professional, the food was excellent. Each course was full of flavour.  The wine was also very good."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Everything you expect and more,"It was perfection in service from walking through the door. Attentive staff, great decor and atmospheric. We had the taster menu with wine parings and was a delight in tastes and balance in food. It could not fault anything or anyone. Worth every penny and the best dining experience of my life."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,I was expecting the TOP but I got just from the service.,"I’m very surprised, we taste the winter menu and I didn’t find extraordinary the dishes… .    Wine: CHABLIS  *VERY GOOD    LANGOUSTINE  Ullahool - Scotland  Renur d'Hanai"", radish, ginger  • the sauce didn’t mix well with the langoustine and it was too runny    JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE  Benout Quiriger - Brittany  guandale, Buddha's band, Kenyan Estate coffee  •good    SCALLOP  Kyle of Localst - Scatland tandoori spics, carros, citrus, coriander  •I was surprised about the scallops because It wasn’t tasty… .

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,SUBLIME!,"Sublime, outstanding, marvellous, brilliant (insert all other adjectives to underline perfection) experience!  It was my second time and I’ve definitely felt the upgrade by 1 star.    Thank you Connaught Team for making this experience unforgettable in my life!"

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Amazing birthday at this place,Had the best birthday lunch at this magnificent restaurant that deserves all its 3 Michellin Stars.  The food was just divine and the staff went the extra mile to make my birthday extra memorable.

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Wonderful,"Impeccable service, beautiful, setting, amazing food. Of course it is expensive, but you get what you pay for. A memorable experience."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,A taste of elegance,Set in a stately hotel..the restaurant continues the ambiance...Very posh and old achool elegance..food exceptional...service perfect..well worth the price.we had the tasting menu

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Simply Outstanding,"This was everything you could ever want from a Michelin Star dining experience. A fabulous location , the food was stunning , the wine pairings were amazing and the service was absolutely impeccable. So when you put all this together it quite simply made for an experience that will live long in the memory.    It all started on arrival at The Connaught Hotel where the staff gave us a warm welcome. We then headed to the restaurant where manager Mirko and the team were waiting for us. After a brief chat he escorted us to our table in the right hand corner giving us the best view of the whole dining room. Here we met Lorenzo who along with some new members of staff would give us a style of service that is second to none. Sommelier Lucas started preceding’s by pouring us a complimentary glass of champagne to welcome us back to Helene Darroze.    We were then given the menu which is a tasting menu including optional supplemented dishes. We looked at the menu while enjoying first a consommé followed by some delightful snacks including Sea Bass & Pumpkin , Purple Beetroot with chicken liver parfait and Vacherin mont D’or , celeriac , black winter truffle.    Now it was time to meet Melina our sommelier for the day who’s bubbly personality and knowledge simply added to a fantastic afternoon. After a little discussion I decided to choose the All Around the World wine pairings. My wife decided to go with wines by the glass. The first wine of the pairings would be a fabulous Slovakian Riesling. This I would enjoy with the first course of Langoustine with retour d’hanoi , radish and ginger a light , fragrant and refreshing dish.    The second course was Onion with lomo iberico , fumaison , sourdough and lemon thyme. This dish was perfectly balanced between the lightness of the consommé and the richness of the sourdough and iberico. This course was paired superbly with Shafer 2018 Chardonnay from the Napa Valley. This was followed be a nice surprise in the addition of a beautiful Foie Gras dish paired with a Maley sparkling cidre.    Next to arrive was the very popular Scallop with tandoori spices , carrot , citrus and coriander. This was paired with a Paolo E Lorenzo 2020 L’Erta from Tuscany. This was to be followed by an amazing Turbot with calcot , caviar and dill. The pairing for this course came courtesy of France . A Meursault 2018 Domaine des Comtes Lafon.    Now it was time for the main course. This was the Pigeon with parsnip , medjool date and ras el hanout. This was paired with a beautifully light Barolo 2016 Cerequio. We then decided to have an additional Cheese Course a mixture of the finest British and French cheese with fruit bread , breadsticks , honey chutney and salad. My wife enjoyed a glass of port while I presented with a Mondeuse Trdition 2007.    Now we moved on to the Dessert section which started with a Bread Ice Cream before we enjoyed the Rhubarb paired with a Kracher 2020 Auslese sweet wine from Austria. We then finished with chocolate heaven. It was Chocolate with madagascar pear and green cardamom. The pairing for this dessert was a fabulous Matusalem Sherry from Spain.    Now we would be in for a nice surprise as we were invited by manager Mirko to go down to the kitchen and see executive chef Marco and the team. Here we got the chance to personally thank the team for the stunning tasting menu.    We would then head back to the dining room to finish with coffee and petit fours. The coffee would be scientifically made by Lorenzo and the petit fours would include a Pistachio Paris Brest , a chocolate tube and a mini doughnut.    This brought to an end to what I can only say was a truly outstanding dining experience and with the new strong members of staff joining the team you can be rest assured this level of consistency will continue for years to come. So if your looking for somewhere for a special occasion I can’t recommend Helene Darroze highly enough. Looking to returning myself later in the year.    Thank You Mirko , Marco , Lorenzo , Melina and all the team for an absolutely amazing lunch and look forward to seeing you all again soon."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Excellent once again,"This is probably the fifth time that we have visited this restaurant over the last couple of years. Once again the service was excellent, the dishes were pieces of art (and tasty!) and the wine chose was sublime. Yes, it may be expensive as some have commented here, but hey, you get value through the whole experience. We work and save hard and then come up to London to have this experience and so far we have not left disappointed. We are looking forward to our next visit in April time."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,Lovely lunch,"We decided to treat ourself for a midweek lunch. It was absolutely lovely, the service was as you would expect. Our only annoyance was on the website it shows a weekday lunch menu which we were planning on getting. When we where shown the menu it only had the tasting menu of which we ended up having 5. We did not question as we assumed if the weekday lunch was available they would have shown this menu as well. So we were a little bit annoyed on this front but still the food and service was lovely"

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,40,Beautiful Food with some Dishes a Bit Bland,"The dishes here are museum quality. Each one is a work of art. Service is excellent as is the setting. The taste is absent in some of the dishes. Some are a bit bland, and some are excellent. The wagyu beef was outstanding, like butter, but the 125 pound upcharge was outrageous. The baba rum also had an 18 pound upcharge for the 30-year-old brandy that was drizzled with. All in all our meal for two was over 500 pounds without any liquor."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Without a doubt - highly recommended! My favourite fine dining restaurant in London.,"Staying at The Connaught over Christmas, we booked for the Christmas Day lunch at Helene Darroze. Having dined here many times, I had high hopes. The team did not disappoint.    From arrival to departure, service was excellent. As with the hotel, the restaurant staff show a genuine warmth in every interaction.    The restaurant oozed Christmas, with a personalised Christmas card from the staff, premium Christmas crackers on the table and even a visit to a couple of the younger diners from Santa. The personalised monogram napkins were also a lovely touch.    The tasting menu was excellent - lots of seasonal flavours. On contacting the restaurant prior, they happily accommodated dietary and allergy requirements. The Sommelier did an excellent job at a matching wine pairing, suitably tweaking the pairing of the main menu. And the selection of Armagnac to finish is amongst the best I’ve seen."

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Worthy of its 3 stars,"My wife and I ate here for the first time though we have eaten in a number of 3 Michelin star restaurants previously. Quality of the food and service was excellent, as was the quantity. We had the 7 course tasting menu which probably had the same again with canapés and extra chefs dishes. Wine was expensive at £140 for a bottle of Chablis but was really good. Visit to the kitchen is a really nice touch as it makes you appreciate the work and the number of staff it takes to produce the dishes you eat. Great restaurant and worthy of its 3 Michelin stars. Definitely recommend!!"

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,50,Wonderful Food,"We have been a couple of times before and every time is amazing. The staff are really friendly, it’s a relaxed atmosphere and the food is amazing."

The Fat Duck,50,It does what it does to perfection!,Working in the industry and being world travelers we feel well placed to comment. The experience at Bray is outstanding. The service is ballet on steroids… but totally human and engaging…with faultless attention to detail. The food as you would expect is honed to perfection...More

The Fat Duck,50,"Garry and Joanne, Yorkshire","What can we say...superb, what an experience for a birthday and unforgetable treat. Mind boggling from what you see in front of you to what you actually eat. See one thing,taste something totally different!!!! Everything anyone who"

The Fat Duck,50,One of a kind!,"This is the most exceptional place and a real one-of-a-kind. Nothing is overlooked and the storytelling and atmosphere is exquisite. Yes, it's incredibly expensive (especially if you go for the wine and cocktail pairings!), but absolutely worth it; the place is faultless."

The Fat Duck,50,As I hoped,"Lived up to expectations food wise, and the non-alcoholic drink paring was superb. My one criticism would be being asked 5 times how our day had been by the robotic waiting staff when we arrived and then whenever a different colleague came over."

The Fat Duck,50,Mind blowing!,"Mind blowing experience, everyone should go at least one in their lifetime! Had the most amazing time and the food was second to none. Our storyteller Josh was super helpful and friendly as were all the staff"

The Fat Duck,50,Amazing experience highly recommend,"Amazing, went for our 2 year anniversary and didn't disappoint in any way! Was a sensory explosion! Would highly recommend"

The Fat Duck,50,Surprise!!!,Always surprises. You come for the experience. You know it will be good and you pay for what you get. Service is top noch and the surprises make it. Will keep coming back

The Fat Duck,50,Bucket list experience,"This wasn't just a fabulous meal, it was also an incredible culinary experience. The staff explained every course, it's concept and ingredients to make it all the more enjoyable. Put a visit to The Fat Duck on your bucket list!"

The Fat Duck,50,Second time - just as good!,We've eaten here twice this year and both times have been excellent and different form each other. It's an experience more than just a meal! It's worth it for a splurge occasion. Nowhere else quite like it.

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Pre flight breakfast,Great service at Plane Food Heathrow terminal 5 from Mariano. I enjoyed my full English breakfast and coffee

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,20,Not so good food,"We went to Ramsays in Harrahs N.Kanas City,, I ordered a steak - medium, it was almost completely well done ! The waitress said oh I see some pink init ! Well I didn’t and it didn’t have any juice ,very poor for a $75 piece of meat, the manager took our two glasses of wine off the bill , that didn’t help ,  My friend took the steak home for a stir fry - very disappointing.  The next evening we went again , sat at the bar, had lobster bisque- that was good, a shrimp cocktail,that was ok, I ordered a wedge salad , the worst salad I ever had, a large head of lettuces cut in half , I couldn’t find any dressing , the waiter said oh it’s on the bottom with a vein of blue cheese - it was awful, server took it off the bill, I didn’t eat it.  I have been to Hells Kitchen in California that was excellent,so most likely it was just this one restaurant,  So disappointed"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Ridiculous,"Jesus Christ. This place is just, wow! Just left and still talking about it two hours later. We had the chefs table and it was just ridiculous. The chef, the waiters. Everything. Is it cheap! No!! But it shouldn’t be, it’s impeccable . The complaints on here, the visitors must be insane. If you’ve not got £500, don’t go, but, it’s incredible. No more words to add, this is the real deal. I wasnt even allowed to open the toilet door myself, or pull my chair in. But that’s not the point , the food , oh my god the food!"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,It should be better!,"Total disappointment at the Restaurant Goron Ramsey (Chelsea). To start with the A/C was not able to get the dining temperature below 80 degrees. In other words, for a dress code venue of coats and even ties it was stifling. The atmosphere was okay but nothing special, cruise ship decor. The presentations and place settings were first class. The food was mostly very good but the main course, was mediocre at best. Wine was reasonable but the drinks were measured with a micrometer and no martinis. The one thing that totally met my expectations was the bill, very big. I am glad I went but I would never go back. I lost all my confidence in the Michelin rating process."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Didn’t live up to the stars or hype,"*Sigh* this is a tough one to write. My wife and I love Chef Ramsay so much & he’s one of the few celebrities for us that if we saw him we’d be starstruck.    Unfortunately, I have to give the experience 3 stars out of 5. We have been to many Michelin starred restaurants all over the world and what separates these restaurants is the service/experience, less so the food. The food here was outstanding. The service, timing, and ambiance weren’t. Don’t get me wrong, the staff was extremely nice and attentive, but there were things that made the visit less than stellar.    1) Timing of the courses was quite inconsistent or delayed. I realize it can’t always be perfect but when the first few courses are spaced out < 5 minutes apart and then it takes 10-15 minutes before the main, you notice the gap. It was also a ~15 minute wait between them taking our last plates away and us receiving the check that we had to ask for. What was most disappointing was that when I’m at a restaurant of that caliber, the last thing I should be thinking is “where is the check so I can leave?”    2) The ambiance wasn’t there. There was only one room for dining and it seemed like there was maybe one too many tables in there. Sitting down at my table I was about a foot away from the guy sitting at the next table and I can tell you every word of their conversation. They faced everyone towards the center of the dining room which I liked, but it was difficult to get out from the table to visit the restroom or avoid bumping the guy to my side at the other table.    3) Service felt frantic. They take the approach of “no one should have an empty glass” and “if you see an empty tray or unfolded napkin, take care of it” - a real collaborative mentality. They take it so far that it’s a detriment to the service. I don’t need my water glassed re-filled every time I sip it and I’d like consistency on who is serving me so I can build a rapport over the meal.    After $750 spent for two, I expected more."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,10,Horrible Experience,Bland and ordinary at ridiculous prices. Good now for ultra wealthy bucket list conscious tourists with no taste.

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Just go,"Fourth visit and still top notch. Ignore any negative reviews, this restaurant is superb in every respect. New sommelier James exceptionally good. If you can afford it, a joy."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Good- expected more,"We came here with friends and it was a good experience but could have been better and given its accolades and it’s price point should have been faultless.    We opted for the carte Blanche as we have never had anything like this on offer at similar establishments. In hindsight we wish we had gone with the standard cheaper menu which had the signature dishes on it.    The starters were excellent the tomato tart, basic as it sounds was absolutely one of the best things I have been served at this level! A work of art and the flavours blew me away, but the highlight at this level should not be a tomato tart…The extra risotto course was divine too but at £50 a portion owing to a truffle flown in from Australia was not easy on the pocket.    It was the mains and the puddings where the experience fell flat. Given the cheaper menu had fillet of beef on it, to be served pidgeion as a main was quite disappointing. I realise food is subjective, but all 4 of us on the table returned the cheese course which is possibly one of, if not the worst dish I have been served at a restaurant of this calibre. It was like a cheese aero and devoid of any texture. The puddings were disappointing too to be served Mille foi was very unimaginative, and there was a mousse served in an egg which again was sent back by the whole table.    We also ordered the wine flight coming in at 200 per person (or there about) and were asked if we wanted a wine to go with the extra course, it turns out the wine supplied was £120 a glass! Almost 2/3 of value of the whole wine flight. We have been in touch with the restaurant about this directly and it was refunded but just be mindful of this if you are intending to dine here as you may not be so lucky!    Being a huge fan of Gordon’s, it was a little bit of a disappointing experience, I wanted to be wowed and I just wasn’t!"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Raises the Culinary Bar,"This was our first meal at a three Michelin Star restaurant, and the experience represents the weight carried by the prestigious award. The food honestly raised the bar to a level I did not even know possible with food. It surpasses the limit of how absolutely sensual food can get. The steak was like nothing else I ever had - a combination of flavour of a ribeye, and tenderness of a fillet, while still maintaining an assertive bite. Appetizers and even palate cleansers had an expertly defined flavour profile which is just indescribable in words.  The service also lives up to the acclaim. A server is always right there, with a smile, to tend to your every need. When one server is done from performing a round, another goes out to replace them. Even the dishes are presented to everyone at table at the exact same time, with zero delay to speak of. It's impeccable, and no request is too great. My request to omit the fish dish was accomodated immediately, and the substitute vegetarian dish also amazed me.    I just have two minor gripes:  1. The dining room decor does not seem to blend with the entrance area. The dining area is rather underwhelming in comparison and could do with an overhaul, especially given the exquisite look and feel of the entrance.    2. Service can almost get too attentive, verging on uncomfortable. I get it you pay a high price, but I do not need a server to rush in front of me to open the door to the bathroom.    So in conclusion - if you're on the fence, try Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. Not only is it an experience to remember, but it proves that the TV personality isn't all just bluff! Chef Abe and his team raise the bar to incredible heights which much of the world do not even know possible, and that alone makes it worth the journey."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Thanks !,"I had the pleasure of dining at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in London, and it was an extraordinary culinary journey.  From the moment I entered, the ambiance exuded elegance and sophistication.  The attention to detail in both the décor and the service was impeccable. The dishes were true works of art, masterfully prepared and bursting with flavors that danced on my taste buds :)  Dining at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant was an unforgettable adventure in fine dining, and I can't wait to return for another exceptional meal.  Thanks :)"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Not live up to the fame,"We visit to Michelin Star restaurant regularly, this is not the worst experience I have ever tried.    Our experience started badly when we were led to the table which is by the wall. The problem with the table is that it was so cramped and close to the tables on both sides. I can not sit directly facing my partner on the other side but have to move my chair to the side in order to avoid the back of my chair pushing the back of the chair of next table. We immediately informed the usher about the problem. We informed the two waiter for a total of three times, one came back saying there is not other table available, the other waiter never come back to us.    Then the manager came and we made a request to him.The manager immediately offered us another unoccupied table which is much more roomy, where I did not have to sit sideways. I really do not know how the other two waiters were doing their job. The manager was doing what a manger in a Michelin star restaurant should do. For a lunch with such price tag, I would legitimately expect a decent table and setting. And the tables are arranged very close.    The food quality is top-notch I would say. I can see that the chef has put in so much effort in preparing the dishes. The salad, the veal, the turbot, and ravioli are all very good."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Wonderful but Overpriced,"This was our first trip to London and being a huge Gordon Ramsay fan we had to try his flagship restaurant. From the moment we arrived we felt special when the doorman called me by name. How he knew who I was is beyond me?? We were seated immediately and soon chose the Carte Blanche option which is 7 courses none of which you are aware of beforehand. We were very very happy that they accommodated my wife’s food allergies without hesitation. This is not always the case. Our Sommelier was excellent guiding us to a wine of our liking without being pushy or judgy. In retrospect I wish I’d have asked him for a recommendation to better pair with our dishes since he knew what we were getting … I didn’t. That’s my issue not his and I’ll be smarter next time. Every course was spectacular as were the palette cleanser and amuse bouche selections. Service was impeccable, attentive but not intrusive. Price was a bit crazy even for a 3 Michelin star establishment, $1,500 Canadian $$ for two people … yikes."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,WOW in London,"Perfect food, perfect wine, testing manu witch will take You into the best coulinary journey :). I try it always when I visit London. Always the same level :)"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Wow amazing 3 star,Really good service and every detail thought of . The food was absolutely amazing . We could not fault anything . The staff were very knowledgeable and nothing was too much

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,"Excellent food and service, but beware of the wine pairing","Dining at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is an experience that promises a delightful culinary journey, something my companion and I were eagerly looking forward to. Opting for the prestige menu, we were privileged to explore a tasteful combination of traditional dishes and innovative new additions.    The food was not just excellent; it was a symphony of incredible flavors, married with impeccable execution. Each dish that was brought to our table felt like a masterful work of art, displaying creativity without losing sight of classical roots. The sharing cheese plate was a particular highlight, where our server demonstrated not only her prowess in mixing but also her exceptional knowledge, recommending truly unique yet extraordinary cheeses.    Service was attentive yet discreet, striking a perfect balance that added to the luxury of the dining experience. Every interaction was refined, courteous, and genuinely engaging, making us feel valued as patrons.    Unfortunately, what could have been an utterly flawless evening was marred by one significant drawback: the wine selection. While the wine list promised a bespoke pairing tailored to both the dishes and the guests' personal taste, we were never consulted about our preferences. The result was a preselected array of wines that were not only poorly paired with the food but also considerably cheap, diminishing the overall impression.    The wine pairing presented two main issues. First, the chosen wines clashed rather than complemented the exquisite dishes. Secondly, the low quality of the wines was noticeable, making the pairing feel incongruous with the otherwise superior meal. This misstep was so pronounced that we found ourselves leaving the wine untouched during the courses, lest it spoil the food – and only drinking them in between.    In conclusion, our dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was a memorable experience filled with culinary triumphs, overshadowed only by the unfulfilled promise of the wine pairing. The restaurant delivers an outstanding performance in nearly every aspect, but the discord in the wine selection is a sour note that needs immediate attention. If addressed, I believe this establishment can truly provide an unparalleled dining experience. Until then, future guests would do well to approach the wine pairing with caution, perhaps opting for one of the excellent Dom Ruinart on the list to accompany the meal."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Delightful culinary experience,Fine dining at its best. We had prestige menu. 7 courses plus canopies. All delightful served by attentive and knowledgeable staff. Can't say which course stood out as they were all sublime. Only underwhelming part of a dish was the panisse...basically chicken pea chips. That besides we has a great evening.

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Most excellent,Excellent service and food. This is the last London three Michelin star restaurant we have visited. I was concerned about some of the negative reviews but my wife and I need not have been worried. Our experience was up their with the best of them.

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Super delicious highlight of our London visit!,"We had an amazing 7 courses surprise menue - WOW, what an extraordinary unforgettable birthday gift from my family ❤️"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Pricy High End British Cuisine,"Our 14 year old son has been fascinated by Gordon Ramsay TV shows and we decided to take him to his flagship restaurant in London. Our server suggested the Carte Blanche menu with so called chefs surprises. After spending $1310 in less than 3 hours, I rate the food and service at this restaurant a 3 compared to top French restaurant such as Alain Ducasse and Helen and Helene Darroze in London. Out of seven servings, only 2 stood out as outstanding, the rest were either good or average. Serving pigeon as the main dish with a sweat sauce was a deal breaker. We had expected high end beef or fresh fish for which London is famous for."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,"Impeccable, Inspired, Innovative and Impressively Tasty - A Best of Britain For Sure!","There are few restaurants that I’d say are at the pinnacle of British dining, fine or otherwise, and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay under Chef Patron Matt Abe is most definitely one. An absolutely stellar culinary experience from start to finish. Good memories of a previous visit brought me back and Chef Matt exceeded all expectations. I tried the Chef’s surprise menu with two of the dishes new to the menu during my visit yesterday. The heirloom tomato tart with peaches was a superb start to the meal, and while I’m no fan of pigeon, the chef’s version was both tasty and enjoyable. Of course being a rice dish aficionado, I jumped at the chance to add the rice with Australian truffle dish, and I’m so glad I did. Service was IMPECCABLE and personable - well done!! Hats off to the sommelier whose choices for pairings were inspired and spot on.    I had a brief moment at the end of the lunch service to thank Chef Matt Abe in person and to listen while he explained to others his philosophy on food preparation and inspiration. Much appreciated! And so now this thank you is to the staff both in the kitchen and front of house. You’re true professionals and I thank for a service WELL DONE!!"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Too bad,"Like the Roman ruins, you know they were great once. Too bad. We all looked forward to the meal, and we were all very disappointed, especially with the wine pairings. Staff great, food and wine very poor."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Mediocre,Kinda meh. Go for carte blanche rather than menu prestige Since I am a gordon ramsay fan- i still went but it was a pretty bland experience

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,20,Gordon Ramsey flag ship Restaurant (London) let down!,"Family Lunch for 5    I don’t normally write reviews but feel compelled here. Had lunch on a Sunday, prebooked. Had the tasting menu.  Positives- staff very attentive. Wine excellent. Food quality was excellent.    Negatives - food quantity small but that’s expected in such establishments.    The environment was very uncomfortable. Firstly it seems their “big” tables can only cater for 4 adults, not five and was a real squeeze. However, what actually spoilt the day was it was extremely hot in the restaurant with the staff and us sweating buckets!! We were assured, with a smile , that aircon was working. A shame, I thought. As made for a very difficult afternoon. The restaurant was about 2/3’s full.  Bill - £1960.00 approx (had 3 bottles of wine).    Not somewhere I can recommend. I think if is hadn’t been so hot, I would have graded average to good."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Great service from Silvia!,Had a great lunch and great service from Silvia! The food was very good as well as the ambiance! Strongly recommend this restaurant.

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Utter disappointment,"I went last year and it was the best meal of my life. I wanted to re experience this with close friends, unfortunately it was not up to expectations. I could explain each course however I'll stick to the main course of Saddleback Pork.  It was dry (over aged) and awfully cooked with almost zero to no flavour, I'm very confused as waht they wanted to achieve with this dish. Compared to last year the prices were higher and portions smaller, the Turbot was minute and the legendary ravioli (which brought me to tears of joy last year) was served with an underwhelming bisque. Such a shame. I'd like to think it was an off day but the portion size and product quality retract that.  Next time I want a ""3 star"" meal I will go to Core."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Simply Outstanding,"Over the last eighteen years we’ve had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Gordon Ramsey on many occasions but I have to say that our latest visit tops the lot. The food was simply outstanding , the wine was excellent and the service was impeccable. So yes this visit which was to celebrate our anniversary will live long in our memory.    Our lunch began with a fabulous warm welcome before being escorted to our table. Here there was a lovely touch from the team in the form of an happy anniversary card and flowers. This was nicely followed by a complimentary glass of champagne to welcome us back to the restaurant. It was then nice to have a catch up with James to see how things have been and to chat about the new members of the team who we can now say seemed to have settled in perfectly.    We were then presented with the menu which was a choice between the Prestige or the surprise Carte Blanche. We both decided to opt for the latter. Next was the wine where we went with jJames recommendation of a bottle of La Cabane Domaine Leon Boesch 2020 Pinot Blanc from Alsace to pair with the first three courses.    Now onto the food itself and please forgive with the description of each dish because the Carte Blanche menu is a surprise so will try and describe them as best I can.    We started with a delightful selection of snacks which was followed by a refreshing Tomato Dashi with basil , celery and lemon verbena.    This led us to the first course and Wow it was absolutely incredible. A Heirloom Tomato Tart with peach , vanilla and smoked stracciatella that was just sublime and easily one of the best dishes I’ve ever had the pleasure of eating. We were then presented with the Herb Parker Loaf with shallots , onion and rosemary before moving to the next course of Lobster with macadamia , elderflower beurre blanc and caviar. This was a dish that looks simple but was amazing and like the first course the flavours were immense.    Next to arrive was the fish course. This was a John Dory with peppers , tomato , herbs and a rich and heavenly bouillabaisse that elevated the dish to the highest level. Now to the main dish of the day of Pigeon with carrot and fennel with a pigeon leg on the side. A dish worthy of being a main course anywhere. Our pigeon was accompanied by a glass of Marina Cvetic Montepulciano d’Abruzzo.    Next to arrive was a fabulous Cheese Course of Tete de Moine with apicot , sobacha , macadamia and elderflower honey. This led us to a Saffron and Passion Fruit palate cleanser which cleared the way to our dessert and oh boy were we in for a treat. The Strawberry Mille Feuille was simply heaven on a plate and I think that’s all that needs saying on this stunning dessert.    We finished with coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a fantastic dining experience. As I said at the beginning the food created by Chef Matt Abe and his team was absolutely incredible , the service was first class , the new team have settled in to the standard of service required with ease and the wine recommendations from James were fabulous. It’s not hard to see why this restaurant has had Three Michelin Stars for so many years which I’m sure will continue for the years to come.    Thank You Matt , Kim , James , Freya , Will and all the team for making this the perfect way to celebrate our anniversary and look forward to seeing you all again soon."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,A lobster tail that couldn't be cut with a steak knife! So overdone you could chew all night.,"Great meal and great service with one huge exception. One course was a lobster tail. It was so tough, I couldn't cut it with the knife - had to pull it apart. It was so chewy it took a minute to swallow one bite. I was apprehensive but sent it back. 20 minutes later (I think the chef was making a point) another identical way overcooked lobster tail came out. They gave me a small salad in its place. The salad was an upgrade."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Wow wow and wow what an experience,"What an experience, this is a quality restaurant with attentive staff (though some of the diners treated them as if they were invisible!,) all the dishes were superbly and artistically presented and most important a fusion of flavours.I don’t get people complaining but hey that’s their choice and they are entitled to it. This was a Christmas present from our son and daughter in law and it was truly indulgent and a lovely experience. The staff were lovely and interacted with you and made you feel welcome and special, okay it’s their job but they are good at it. Yes wine is expensive but it is the best, and meal is expensive but you are paying for quality and Michelin experience. I would unhesitatingly recommend this restaurant for a very special occasion or an indulgent gift. Thank you every one of the staff it was lovely. I wish I’d taken pictures of the dishes but I felt maybe it was a bit naff, I regret it now."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,10,DO NOT ENTERTAIN THIS LOCATION,"This location might have superb service; however, they wanted the business group to come in with Covid-19. We would have shut down the entire restaurant. They threatened us with an 800 pound no show fee. So, we went with Covid. Turns out this is not the only time. I would be careful entering this facility at your own health risk."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Perfection,"This was stars 10,11 and 12 of 2023 all in one meal.    If you’ve read my other reviews you’ll have seen I have been to Petrus 3 or 4 times now and I’ve always wondered what makes Restaurant Gordon Ramsey a 3* experience versus Petrus at “only” 1*.    Today we finally got a seat to find out.    The restaurant itself is rather small, but I quite liked that; made for a more intimate experience and adds to the exclusivity.    So after a couple of glasses of pink champagne we decided to take the “Carte Blanche” menu for 2 - basically 7 courses of surprises along with the wine pairing.    I won’t go into detail on every course - it’ll take too long and be too boring. All I can say is every dish was utter perfection.  I honestly could not find fault even if I wanted too.  Surprisingly for me the stand out favourite wasn’t what I expected it to be (normally lobster) … it was a dish of potatoes, wild asparagus and morel with the most amazing sauce I’ve ever had (I think it was Viognier and wild garlic sauce).    The wine pairing was delicious and James (sommelier) was an absolute delight to speak with both about the wines and just in general.  All staff were exactly what you’d expect from Ramsey.    At risk of repeating myself - I can’t find fault anywhere.    One thing I still don’t understand though … why is Petrus 1* … for me it was certainly on a par with RGR.    First world problem! If you have the opportunity you must must must dine here."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Very brilliant,"The menu is one of the best i have seen there are not too many dishes ,but there something for everyone.it was a bit crowded when we visited."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Much room for improvement.,"Compared to other 3 michelin starred restaurants, here there is much room for improvement, this is more like a posh 1-star Michelin, restaurant was half full and no atmosphere.  The first 2 offerings were vegetable based and not memorable, quite boring, low-cost ingredients and no thrills. The signature Lobster ravioli was average, the last time I had this dish it was much fresher tasting with better seasoning, previously the sauce was lobster based and intense, this time it was more like a tomato sauce, (not so good). The turbot dish was confit in olive oil, the flavour was bland and just of oil, the turbot was indecipherable and could have been any protein as there was no definition or turbot flavour, it was under whelming. The 100-day beef was served with turnips also very under whelming. The turnips were boring and the beef was average, nothing special in flavour or texture. You expect a fine experience with the finest ingredients but there was no foie gras or caviar here. The wine list was good, the dessert of Pecan and Praline was very good. Overall, would not return, it seems that this restaurant offers low-cost ingredients throughout most of the dishes leaving nothing special to talk about.  The front of house & GM were professional as you would expect of a 3 michelin star restaurant. The food – ingredients and atmosphere are lacking and in need of improvement. To be transparent we did give our feedback to the staff on the day as well as informing them that we would be leaving an online review and they said they would relay this to the kitchen."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Just Fabulous!,"Well there are no words. Worth the money, it is all  About the experience. This was the one thing my nephew wanted to do in London, and it was well worth it! The entire staff was extremely gracious to us. Clearly very knowledgeable about the food, and wine. I would do it again."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,A delighful evening,"I took my sister for a big birthday dinner because she is such a big GR fan. It was a wonderful experience all round. I've been to many MIchelin star restaurants and this one was the most enjoyable. The service was impeccable. Not only that but the staff truly made us feel welcome and relaxed. Quite often these places can be quite stiff - not so at GR. They were just simply kind and while extremely professional, also human which I greatly appreciated. I must shout out to the assistant manager, a lovely lady, who was a delight and agreeably answered our questions about her career path. In addition, James, the sommelier chose the wines for us and they were incredible. One wine which was an optional accompaniment actually brought me close to tears it was so wonderful.    While the meal and the accompanying wines were expensive, if you're up for a splurge, let them choose the menu and the wines and prepare to be amazed and delighted.    Thank you all for a wonderful evening. It was memorable on all fronts."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Great food.. but no cash payment ruined the experiance..,"Had a fantastic dinner with my wife, mom and a friend.. everything was awesome untill we had to pay, and i found out the resturant has chosen to follow this new anoying trend to not take CASH..    Usaly when i travel to resturants like this in another country (we are from denmark) i take out cash to pay for the resturant experiance. The main reason for this is there is a limit on our card and with flight, hotel, theater and other stuff we hit this limit realy fast…    The fact that we could not pay with cash, ment i had to pay a fee to my bank to extend the limit and spend the rest of my trip with a none functional card..    I will from now on check beforhand and resturants that dont offer a cash option will not be visited.. not that i think you care hehe."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Double charging,"My wife and I dined at Gordon Ramsey last night.  I had booked to be at the Inspiration table.  We asked to be moved into the main restaurant - as the 'inspiration' table is in the lobby area - where you pass if you need the wc and the staff congregate to go into the restaurant.  I had paid the £250 per head charge in advance.  The OpenTable confirmation stated 'Price listed includes VAT, all fees and service charges'.  On receiving the bill I was charged an additional £75 (15% x £500) for service.  I refused to pay.  The manger (Enrico Baroneto) finally removed all the service charge.  On getting home I emailed the manager with the OenTable confirmation stating the service was included.  He simply wrote back saying it was an OpenTable error - with no apology of any kind."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Great but the purifying grates ….,"Excellent service, very good food , extensive wine list ….. but, at a price …… and, in the case of the wine ……… AT A PRICE. Yes this is near the pinnacle of fine dining but only the service really justifies the £300 a person or so that you are likely to spend. The food is very, very good but I have had better in the price range and there are many places I would prefer on a ‘value’ basis. The price of wine on the list starts high, gets higher then goes to stratospheric. I spotted a wine on the list that I had in Seville not so long ago - here £150 plus ….. Seville 40 Euros……. you have to love the U.K. tax, pricing system ….."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Very excellent Team of Service Staff. Kudos to the GM!,"We have chosen to dine at this Gordon Ramsay's home ground restaurant in London solely because we wanted to give his restaurant a 2nd chance after our not very satisfactory experience, food wise, at Le Pressoir d'Argent in Bordeaux France just 2 months prior in December 2022. Thinking that food should be much better here in London.    At this Royal Hospital Road restaurant, we were allocated a so-called Chef's Table. This table is located near the entrance of the restaurant which is dimly lighted and in a very busy area. Small space and totally open. There is no partition for privacy at all.    When guest arrived or leave, they will have to pass just in front of this only table. And this is the only table in the whole restaurant without a tablecloth. When someone goes to the toilet he will also has to pass in front of this table. Btw, this table resembles a reception counter. Both of us sat side by side behind it and felt like we were the receptionist there that night. We felt totally left out and were stressed out.  Fyi, there isn't a stool for me to place my handbag. I had to put my bag onto the floor at this table.    We told the staff of our concerned. They explained that this is a special table for certain set menu that we have chosen. I think was the more expensive one where the chef will personally explain every course to the guest. Apparently, the chef was not able to do this inside the restaurant.    We were totally not comfortable sitting there. Imagine, dining at a 3 Michelin stars restaurant with staff and guest constantly passing in front of you. Watching staff greeting the guest when they arrived then leading the guest to their table into the dining room proper. Staff showing the guest where the toilet is....... with constant disturbance.  I think Gordon need to sit there one day with his wife when the restaurant is in full service to feel how his guest feels when dining at this table. This is the only 3 stars restaurants that we have dined in that made us felt so stressed out and very unhappy. It gave us the feeling that the restaurant was full, so they put us there.  I have just read that apparently other reviewer also complained when they were given this table.    Initially, the staff didn't relocate us to another table despite us clearly showing sign of distress. They went ahead to served us our appetizer. Before this, no one ever offer us the drinks menu. We had our appetizer without any drinks to go with it.  I started to get unsettled at this point and told my partner that we should leave the restaurant immediately even if they were to charge us the full price. Especially after the lady staff with dark and straight hair, started to show us her ""take it or leave it"" attitude. She was our only complaint with regards to service that night, the rest of the staff were excellent.    Luckily their General Manager, came to the rescue. Guessed the staff probably informed him. Without his intervention we would have left fuming mad.    They relocated us to the last table ,with white tablecloth , in the dining room proper where the rest of the guest was sitting. We felt more relieved and at ease here and also maybe because that particular lady staff didn't serve us anymore.    Btw, there is a stool here to place my handbag.    The service level from this point onwards definitely matched a 3 Michelin stars standard. Sadly, the food didn't though was much better than the one in Bordeaux where the 2 Michelin stars menu consisted of a lot of bread items."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Amazing meal!,"It didn't start well as our taxi dropped us off up the road at the closed down Gordon Bar&Grill, however we soon found the restaurant which is in a strange location and the only negative!  Inside it's fairly small but that's fine, good atmosphere, the table was small for 5 people so slight uncomfortable.  Had the prestige tasting menu and this was without a doubt the best I've had, having done lots of top restaurants including recently Black Swan @ Oldstead, Shaun Rankin etc  Each course was beautifully presented and tasted amazing! The service was exceptional too!  Amazing place"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,20,Gastronomic Mirage: The Unfulfilled Promises of Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant,"In the hallowed halls of culinary excellence, one name looms larger than all others - Gordon Ramsay. With great anticipation, I ventured to his acclaimed restaurant, my palate yearning for a taste of gastronomic perfection. Alas, dear readers, what transpired was a bitter symphony of disappointment.    The staff, a cadre of well-rehearsed professionals, executed their duties with utmost precision. Their attentiveness was akin to a warm embrace, albeit one that could not fully insulate me from the disquieting sounds of yelling that emanated from the kitchen. It was a discordant note in an otherwise mellifluous performance.    The food, while undeniably delectable, was marred by its own shortcomings. The portions, a mere wisp of sustenance, left me famished, longing for a more satisfying repast. I journeyed from the sunburnt shores of Australia, my expectations soaring like the majestic ibis, only to be met with a deflating experience.    The cost, a cruel insult to injury, did little to ameliorate my mounting dissatisfaction. The prices, as grand as the chef's reputation, were not commensurate with the diminutive servings that graced our plates.    In conclusion, while Ramsay's restaurant may boast impeccable service and flavors that dance upon the tongue, the meager portions and exorbitant prices overshadow its merits. It is with a heavy heart that I must declare my reluctance to return to this establishment. The dream of culinary nirvana shall, for now, remain elusive."

This was nicely followed by a complimentary glass of champagne to welcome us back to the restaurant. It was then nice to have a catch up with James to see how things have been and to chat about the new members of the team who we can now say seemed to have settled in perfectly.    We were then presented with the menu which was a choice between the Prestige or the surprise Carte Blanche. We both decided to opt for the latter. Next was the wine where we went with jJames recommendation of a bottle of La Cabane Domaine Leon Boesch 2020 Pinot Blanc from Alsace to pair with the first three courses.    Now onto the food itself and please forgive with the description of each dish because the Carte Blanche menu is a surprise so will try and describe them as best I can.    We started with a delightful selection of snacks which was followed by a refreshing Tomato Dashi with basil , celery and lemon verbena.    This led us to the first course and Wow it was absolutely incredible. A Heirloom Tomato Tart with peach , vanilla and smoked stracciatella that was just sublime and easily one of the best dishes I’ve ever had the pleasure of eating. We were then presented with the Herb Parker Loaf with shallots , onion and rosemary before moving to the next course of Lobster with macadamia , elderflower beurre blanc and caviar. This was a dish that looks simple but was amazing and like the first course the flavours were immense.    Next to arrive was the fish course. This was a John Dory with peppers , tomato , herbs and a rich and heavenly bouillabaisse that elevated the dish to the highest level. Now to the main dish of the day of Pigeon with carrot and fennel with a pigeon leg on the side. A dish worthy of being a main course anywhere. Our pigeon was accompanied by a glass of Marina Cvetic Montepulciano d’Abruzzo.    Next to arrive was a fabulous Cheese Course of Tete de Moine with apicot , sobacha , macadamia and elderflower honey. This led us to a Saffron and Passion Fruit palate cleanser which cleared the way to our dessert and oh boy were we in for a treat. The Strawberry Mille Feuille was simply heaven on a plate and I think that’s all that needs saying on this stunning dessert.    We finished with coffee and petit fours to bring to an end a fantastic dining experience. As I said at the beginning the food created by Chef Matt Abe and his team was absolutely incredible , the service was first class , the new team have settled in to the standard of service required with ease and the wine recommendations from James were fabulous. It’s not hard to see why this restaurant has had Three Michelin Stars for so many years which I’m sure will continue for the years to come.    Thank You Matt , Kim , James , Freya , Will and all the team for making this the perfect way to celebrate our anniversary and look forward to seeing you all again soon."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,A lobster tail that couldn't be cut with a steak knife! So overdone you could chew all night.,"Great meal and great service with one huge exception. One course was a lobster tail. It was so tough, I couldn't cut it with the knife - had to pull it apart. It was so chewy it took a minute to swallow one bite. I was apprehensive but sent it back. 20 minutes later (I think the chef was making a point) another identical way overcooked lobster tail came out. They gave me a small salad in its place. The salad was an upgrade."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Wow wow and wow what an experience,"What an experience, this is a quality restaurant with attentive staff (though some of the diners treated them as if they were invisible!,) all the dishes were superbly and artistically presented and most important a fusion of flavours.I don’t get people complaining but hey that’s their choice and they are entitled to it. This was a Christmas present from our son and daughter in law and it was truly indulgent and a lovely experience. The staff were lovely and interacted with you and made you feel welcome and special, okay it’s their job but they are good at it. Yes wine is expensive but it is the best, and meal is expensive but you are paying for quality and Michelin experience. I would unhesitatingly recommend this restaurant for a very special occasion or an indulgent gift. Thank you every one of the staff it was lovely. I wish I’d taken pictures of the dishes but I felt maybe it was a bit naff, I regret it now."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,10,DO NOT ENTERTAIN THIS LOCATION,"This location might have superb service; however, they wanted the business group to come in with Covid-19. We would have shut down the entire restaurant. They threatened us with an 800 pound no show fee. So, we went with Covid. Turns out this is not the only time. I would be careful entering this facility at your own health risk."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Perfection,"This was stars 10,11 and 12 of 2023 all in one meal.    If you’ve read my other reviews you’ll have seen I have been to Petrus 3 or 4 times now and I’ve always wondered what makes Restaurant Gordon Ramsey a 3* experience versus Petrus at “only” 1*.    Today we finally got a seat to find out.    The restaurant itself is rather small, but I quite liked that; made for a more intimate experience and adds to the exclusivity.    So after a couple of glasses of pink champagne we decided to take the “Carte Blanche” menu for 2 - basically 7 courses of surprises along with the wine pairing.    I won’t go into detail on every course - it’ll take too long and be too boring. All I can say is every dish was utter perfection.  I honestly could not find fault even if I wanted too.  Surprisingly for me the stand out favourite wasn’t what I expected it to be (normally lobster) … it was a dish of potatoes, wild asparagus and morel with the most amazing sauce I’ve ever had (I think it was Viognier and wild garlic sauce).    The wine pairing was delicious and James (sommelier) was an absolute delight to speak with both about the wines and just in general.  All staff were exactly what you’d expect from Ramsey.    At risk of repeating myself - I can’t find fault anywhere.    One thing I still don’t understand though … why is Petrus 1* … for me it was certainly on a par with RGR.    First world problem! If you have the opportunity you must must must dine here."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Very brilliant,"The menu is one of the best i have seen there are not too many dishes ,but there something for everyone.it was a bit crowded when we visited."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Much room for improvement.,"Compared to other 3 michelin starred restaurants, here there is much room for improvement, this is more like a posh 1-star Michelin, restaurant was half full and no atmosphere.  The first 2 offerings were vegetable based and not memorable, quite boring, low-cost ingredients and no thrills. The signature Lobster ravioli was average, the last time I had this dish it was much fresher tasting with better seasoning, previously the sauce was lobster based and intense, this time it was more like a tomato sauce, (not so good). The turbot dish was confit in olive oil, the flavour was bland and just of oil, the turbot was indecipherable and could have been any protein as there was no definition or turbot flavour, it was under whelming. The 100-day beef was served with turnips also very under whelming. The turnips were boring and the beef was average, nothing special in flavour or texture. You expect a fine experience with the finest ingredients but there was no foie gras or caviar here. The wine list was good, the dessert of Pecan and Praline was very good. Overall, would not return, it seems that this restaurant offers low-cost ingredients throughout most of the dishes leaving nothing special to talk about.  The front of house & GM were professional as you would expect of a 3 michelin star restaurant. The food – ingredients and atmosphere are lacking and in need of improvement. To be transparent we did give our feedback to the staff on the day as well as informing them that we would be leaving an online review and they said they would relay this to the kitchen."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Just Fabulous!,"Well there are no words. Worth the money, it is all  About the experience. This was the one thing my nephew wanted to do in London, and it was well worth it! The entire staff was extremely gracious to us. Clearly very knowledgeable about the food, and wine. I would do it again."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,A delighful evening,"I took my sister for a big birthday dinner because she is such a big GR fan. It was a wonderful experience all round. I've been to many MIchelin star restaurants and this one was the most enjoyable. The service was impeccable. Not only that but the staff truly made us feel welcome and relaxed. Quite often these places can be quite stiff - not so at GR. They were just simply kind and while extremely professional, also human which I greatly appreciated. I must shout out to the assistant manager, a lovely lady, who was a delight and agreeably answered our questions about her career path. In addition, James, the sommelier chose the wines for us and they were incredible. One wine which was an optional accompaniment actually brought me close to tears it was so wonderful.    While the meal and the accompanying wines were expensive, if you're up for a splurge, let them choose the menu and the wines and prepare to be amazed and delighted.    Thank you all for a wonderful evening. It was memorable on all fronts."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,Great food.. but no cash payment ruined the experiance..,"Had a fantastic dinner with my wife, mom and a friend.. everything was awesome untill we had to pay, and i found out the resturant has chosen to follow this new anoying trend to not take CASH..    Usaly when i travel to resturants like this in another country (we are from denmark) i take out cash to pay for the resturant experiance. The main reason for this is there is a limit on our card and with flight, hotel, theater and other stuff we hit this limit realy fast…    The fact that we could not pay with cash, ment i had to pay a fee to my bank to extend the limit and spend the rest of my trip with a none functional card..    I will from now on check beforhand and resturants that dont offer a cash option will not be visited.. not that i think you care hehe."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Double charging,"My wife and I dined at Gordon Ramsey last night.  I had booked to be at the Inspiration table.  We asked to be moved into the main restaurant - as the 'inspiration' table is in the lobby area - where you pass if you need the wc and the staff congregate to go into the restaurant.  I had paid the £250 per head charge in advance.  The OpenTable confirmation stated 'Price listed includes VAT, all fees and service charges'.  On receiving the bill I was charged an additional £75 (15% x £500) for service.  I refused to pay.  The manger (Enrico Baroneto) finally removed all the service charge.  On getting home I emailed the manager with the OenTable confirmation stating the service was included.  He simply wrote back saying it was an OpenTable error - with no apology of any kind."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Great but the purifying grates ….,"Excellent service, very good food , extensive wine list ….. but, at a price …… and, in the case of the wine ……… AT A PRICE. Yes this is near the pinnacle of fine dining but only the service really justifies the £300 a person or so that you are likely to spend. The food is very, very good but I have had better in the price range and there are many places I would prefer on a ‘value’ basis. The price of wine on the list starts high, gets higher then goes to stratospheric. I spotted a wine on the list that I had in Seville not so long ago - here £150 plus ….. Seville 40 Euros……. you have to love the U.K. tax, pricing system ….."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Very excellent Team of Service Staff. Kudos to the GM!,"We have chosen to dine at this Gordon Ramsay's home ground restaurant in London solely because we wanted to give his restaurant a 2nd chance after our not very satisfactory experience, food wise, at Le Pressoir d'Argent in Bordeaux France just 2 months prior in December 2022. Thinking that food should be much better here in London.    At this Royal Hospital Road restaurant, we were allocated a so-called Chef's Table. This table is located near the entrance of the restaurant which is dimly lighted and in a very busy area. Small space and totally open. There is no partition for privacy at all.    When guest arrived or leave, they will have to pass just in front of this only table. And this is the only table in the whole restaurant without a tablecloth. When someone goes to the toilet he will also has to pass in front of this table. Btw, this table resembles a reception counter. Both of us sat side by side behind it and felt like we were the receptionist there that night. We felt totally left out and were stressed out.  Fyi, there isn't a stool for me to place my handbag. I had to put my bag onto the floor at this table.    We told the staff of our concerned. They explained that this is a special table for certain set menu that we have chosen. I think was the more expensive one where the chef will personally explain every course to the guest. Apparently, the chef was not able to do this inside the restaurant.    We were totally not comfortable sitting there. Imagine, dining at a 3 Michelin stars restaurant with staff and guest constantly passing in front of you. Watching staff greeting the guest when they arrived then leading the guest to their table into the dining room proper. Staff showing the guest where the toilet is....... with constant disturbance.  I think Gordon need to sit there one day with his wife when the restaurant is in full service to feel how his guest feels when dining at this table. This is the only 3 stars restaurants that we have dined in that made us felt so stressed out and very unhappy. It gave us the feeling that the restaurant was full, so they put us there.  I have just read that apparently other reviewer also complained when they were given this table.    Initially, the staff didn't relocate us to another table despite us clearly showing sign of distress. They went ahead to served us our appetizer. Before this, no one ever offer us the drinks menu. We had our appetizer without any drinks to go with it.  I started to get unsettled at this point and told my partner that we should leave the restaurant immediately even if they were to charge us the full price. Especially after the lady staff with dark and straight hair, started to show us her ""take it or leave it"" attitude. She was our only complaint with regards to service that night, the rest of the staff were excellent.    Luckily their General Manager, came to the rescue. Guessed the staff probably informed him. Without his intervention we would have left fuming mad.    They relocated us to the last table ,with white tablecloth , in the dining room proper where the rest of the guest was sitting. We felt more relieved and at ease here and also maybe because that particular lady staff didn't serve us anymore.    Btw, there is a stool here to place my handbag.    The service level from this point onwards definitely matched a 3 Michelin stars standard. Sadly, the food didn't though was much better than the one in Bordeaux where the 2 Michelin stars menu consisted of a lot of bread items."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Amazing meal!,"It didn't start well as our taxi dropped us off up the road at the closed down Gordon Bar&Grill, however we soon found the restaurant which is in a strange location and the only negative!  Inside it's fairly small but that's fine, good atmosphere, the table was small for 5 people so slight uncomfortable.  Had the prestige tasting menu and this was without a doubt the best I've had, having done lots of top restaurants including recently Black Swan @ Oldstead, Shaun Rankin etc  Each course was beautifully presented and tasted amazing! The service was exceptional too!  Amazing place"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,20,Gastronomic Mirage: The Unfulfilled Promises of Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant,"In the hallowed halls of culinary excellence, one name looms larger than all others - Gordon Ramsay. With great anticipation, I ventured to his acclaimed restaurant, my palate yearning for a taste of gastronomic perfection. Alas, dear readers, what transpired was a bitter symphony of disappointment.    The staff, a cadre of well-rehearsed professionals, executed their duties with utmost precision. Their attentiveness was akin to a warm embrace, albeit one that could not fully insulate me from the disquieting sounds of yelling that emanated from the kitchen. It was a discordant note in an otherwise mellifluous performance.    The food, while undeniably delectable, was marred by its own shortcomings. The portions, a mere wisp of sustenance, left me famished, longing for a more satisfying repast. I journeyed from the sunburnt shores of Australia, my expectations soaring like the majestic ibis, only to be met with a deflating experience.    The cost, a cruel insult to injury, did little to ameliorate my mounting dissatisfaction. The prices, as grand as the chef's reputation, were not commensurate with the diminutive servings that graced our plates.    In conclusion, while Ramsay's restaurant may boast impeccable service and flavors that dance upon the tongue, the meager portions and exorbitant prices overshadow its merits. It is with a heavy heart that I must declare my reluctance to return to this establishment. The dream of culinary nirvana shall, for now, remain elusive."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Superb as I anticipated,"Date of visit: 09/02/2023    Similar to CORE, it took me unbelievable patience and dedication to finally grab a spot here for dinner. The effort was worth it. The minute I walked in, I knew something spectacular was to come.    The service was top-level as expected. I thought I vaguely recognized the waiter that welcomed us; soon to realize that we had seen each other before when I was dining at Bibendum (Claude Bosi) as he was working there at the time. This was a very nice surprise indeed!    Canapés here were among the best I've ever had. The English muffin with caviar and maple syrup (the latter being poured tableside), whilst sounding like a potentially disastrous combination, tasted fabulous and was the sort of canapé where after eating one you're going to want to eat another ten - sensational. Other canapés like the timeless classic truffle gougère and beef tartare tart impressed just as much. A gorgeous cup of bacon and lentil velouté/cappuccino followed, which was absolutely bursting with a rich, meaty flavour and needless to say, was perfect for a cold February evening.    The duck salad was a true case of a dish where ingredients were simply left to shine and speak for themselves. The fact a simple dish of duck and root vegetables could taste this good indicates the importance of growing produce to the best of one's ability. The saltiness of the duck alongside the sweet and tangy flavour of the vegetables balanced the salad perfectly. Gordon Ramsay's signature lobster ravioli was accompanied by a sauce américaine, which complemented it perfectly. This was possibly the best pasta dish I've ever had, along with the mushroom fagottini I had at Murano a year or so prior. The texture was delightful and the filling was flavoursome. The citrus beurre blanc, despite, being slightly too sweet, added a cool, unique twist to the turbot dish, and it was nice to have a break from the traditional French dish of white fish and standard beurre blanc, which has a tendency to be rather rich sometimes. The truffle linguine was gorgeous, but I feel the £50 supplement was slightly harsh! The Blue Grey beef was a great, hearty dish that went well with its accompaniments.    The pecan praline, which I later discovered was chef patron Matt Abé's signature dessert, was rich, indulgent and delicious. The array of textures from the biscuit, ice cream and mousse meant the dessert was well-balanced. The Pedro Ximénez and cocoa nib ice cream added a great extra flavour to the typical but pleasant flavour of pecan praline. This was a wonderful dessert. The petit-fours were elegant and well-crafted. The sea buckthorn pâte de fruits was a real highlight as were the chocolate shards!    This is genuinely one of the best meals you can have in the UK at the moment. Everything lived up to our expectations. If you want a faultless, beautiful meal, this is the right place for you. It's no surprise the restaurant has kept its 3 Michelin stars for 22 years and continues to be considered a world-class restaurant ;)"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,30,Disappointed,"Disappointing. Having dined at all the Michelin star restaurants in London recently, this was the weakest. Flavours were meh. It’s as though there’s a complacency. Unfortunate."

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,10,Don’t waste your money or time,"I’d been to this restaurant once before whilst under the eye of the incredible Clare Smyth. The meal was memorable hence my return many years later, this time under new head chef. Whilst entering the restaurant, the security man greeted me by my name, I was extremely impressed! And all the way to the table we were greeted with such a warm welcome, I couldn’t wait for the experience to come. Canapés and amuse-bouche were all delicious but this is where unfortunately the excitement ended. We opted for the wine pairings (sommeliers selection of their wines by the glass) and the carte blanche tasting menu. Total per person @£410, one wouldn’t expect anything short of spectacular. Here’s my feedback:  • Dish 1: Scallop sashimi with pickle  I just felt this dish was odd. The sashimi was warm…warm raw fish is never going to taste fresh no matter how fresh the fish is. The pickles and pickle sauce just completely over powered the fish anyway so I ended up eating pickle juice with warm slime texture… this dish needs rethinking. Could have been eating pickle from a jar.  • Dish 2: Lobster with Carrot and Grapefruit  This dish kind of ruined our evening. My husband kept saying the dish was rancid and tasted like pith. Mine was not noticeably bad so I tried his and it was as if they’d soaked the lobster in grapefruit juice and forgotten about it for hours. Worst yet in his last of 3 bites (lobster was small) he pulled out a pip from his mouth. We raised to the waiter, no one came to apologise so raised it again, the manager said mistakes happen. No they don’t, not in a £500pp 3 Michelin star restaurant, I highly doubt they’d be saying that to a Michelin inspector! After expressing our disassociation we asked to take my husbands lobster off the bill. They kindly charged us both for the lower priced tasting menu instead of the carte Blanche.  • Dish 3: Cod with bacon  We chose the carte Blanche menu which is more expensive because it promised an ‘entirely bespoke menu’. Clearly not bespoke as I’ve seen this dish posted on here by plenty of others. The cod was cooked beautifully but the bacon sauce was just horribly bitter. Could not taste the cod at all, really unbalanced dish. Borderline unenjoyable.  • Dish 4: Hogget  This was probably the best dish as it had the most flavour (which wasn’t hard), although again it wasn’t bespoke.  • Dish 5: Brie de Meaux with black truffle  Really wanted to enjoy this but could barely taste the cheese under all the truffle which wasn’t particularly exquisite either. So a surprisingly bland dish which I found odd.  • Dish 6: Sorbet  This was nice but have seen this on the normal menu so not bespoke.  • Dish 7: Chocolate dish  Also seen some version of this on the normal menu so not bespoke. It honestly looked and tasted like a high street restaurant trying to make a fancy looking dessert but failing on the flavour. It really didn’t taste very unique at all.    I feel very disappointed and cheated by Michelin for awarding this restaurant 3 stars for another year. The prices are extortionate and quite frankly day light robbery given the extremely boring menu and dishes. In terms of the wine, I don’t buy the sommelier choosing the pairing from the wines by the glass section of the wine list. It makes me feel a little cheated again. A.Wong doesn’t have a printed wine pairing either but the wines chosen by the sommelier paired amazingly, he genuinely spent time to curate the pairings on offer, not just picked from by the glass menu.    I do question whether Gordon Ramsay has eaten here recently or how often he reviews the chefs dishes. Really fell short of the mark and would be very surprised if he’d pay for similar food if it wasn’t his restaurant. I imagine there’d be many ‘F’ words flying around if this didn’t have his name to it! Gordon, if you ever read this please get in contact!"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,50,Another level! Loved it,"My 1st 3 x Michelin experience, so nothing at that level to compare it to! But I loved the everything about it.    Service 5/5, from the second the door is opened, coats take and the welcome Every trip to the loo, the plating, the poring of water and wine. The canapés. It was done with class, style and a smile. Made to feel important without being irritating.    Ambiance 4/5 a very small intimate restaurant with about 40 covers (guessing) chefs table is on the lobby area, looked lovely but glad we were not out there.  We were a table of 6 in the middle of the restaurant with lots of tables of 2 lined up each side of us and a couple of 4’s in the window. Felt a bit like the high table at a wedding. We were louder then surrounding tables as a group which I was conscious of as they all had their romantic evening, as we gassed over several bottles of wine in the middle. Hope we did not ruin the experience for them.    Food 5/5 was amazing. We had the choice of 2 tasting menus, one a surprise, one was a menu. 5 went fir the surprise 1 menu.  This was my 1st tasting menu in life, but I enjoyed every course, every texture and every flavour. The excuse for visit was my birthday. Smallest most beautiful birthday cake was given to me (no happy birthday luckily for the other guests) lol    Wine List.  I put a friend in charge of that 5/5 for his choices. It was delivered on a tablet which seemed to work, but…  Started with the house champagne which was very nice  3 bottles of Haut Medoc, not sure of the vineyard. But it drank very well and was decanted Bering a candle flame which I like as a tradition.  Pudding wine was very delicious.    I would go back (need to save up a bit lol) it is a lot of money, but a bit like travelling 1st class, is it really really worth it! Bloody amazing, bloody brilliant. Superb…. But at £600 a head it’s one hell of an outlay.    I think worth it.    Thank you"

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,40,It's worth a try...,"Firstly, this place had incredible serving staff. They were all so friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The food was lovely, but not as good as I expected.    The biggest negative was the room was half empty on arrival and within an hour of us arriving, we were the only ones in there and the staff were buzzing around setting up for dinner service, so we felt quite uncomfortable and frankly in the way. (our table was booked for 2.15pm)    Once the room was ‘empty’ there were multiple times staff members came out speaking loudly and other members of staff told them to ‘shush’ as there were people still eating (ie. us)    I’m glad we went, but for just shy of £700 for 2 people I would have expected more."

Waterside Inn,50,Springboks,South Africa for the win. Booommm 2023 champions once again. Great food and drinks at Wtaerside inn.

Waterside Inn,40,Food and service amazing 👏,"Excellent food and service, good accommodation and ok atmosphere would sum up our experience.    The food and service throughout was excellent. Pricy, but for what you get we thought value for money.    Another poster mentioned a canteen style atmosphere. We felt that was unfair, but some quiet background music, especially if live or selected carefully, we think would only add to the experience.    Accommodation for what is charged is only ok. Again, service rescued it, really nice turn down service and I'm sure our bathroom consumables were replenished at the same time, really good attention to detail if so. Room was a decent size, perhaps starting to look a touch tired now.    Essentially the food and service are the stars, as you should probably expect. We would love to be lucky enough to dine here again :)    Dave and Amanda Kerfoot 😍"

Waterside Inn,50,ANOTHER WONDERFUL STAY,"Every year we stay in the lovely cottage named The Mallards which overlooks the Thames and it is glorious just watching the ducks and the boats sailing past. Then comes the amazing meal for dinner. At this time of the year there is a golden plum souffle, my first one was a few years ago, this time I ordered 2 as it is so good and I did not want to wait until 2024. They were stunning. Also I had a fantastic risotto as a starter which I hope is available next visit. This restaurant fully deserves it 3 Michelin stars and we will be booking again shortly."

Waterside Inn,50,An unique dining experience!,This is a 3* Mitchellin experience from the moment you arrive at the beautiful period building on the edge of the Thames. The staff is extremely attentive without being overbearing. The restaurant opens up on the River with a friendly ambiance.  We had the Al a Carte menu starting with several Amuse bouche portions leading up to the Pan fried Foie gras accompanied with a Sauternes: fabulous!  My main was Duck breast and my wife had the Sea bass. Both exceptional!  A wonderful experience not to be missed!

Waterside Inn,50,A Happy anniversary dinner.,"An overnight wedding anniversary with room and menu exceptionnel. Waterside Inn is in a lovely setting on the Thames and the first night of their autumn menu was a great success, in a splendid mirror clad room. Delightfully decorated small plates of top quality food, a very well balanced menu. The steamed sea bass was just slightly overcooked. The warm golden plum souffle, beautifully risen, tasted only of sugar. I had two mouthfulls only, my partner ate it all. Those were the only downsides. Eating here is as much an experience as a meal. Portions are small but were were totally stuffed towards the end and could not eat the pretty 'mignardises'. The staff were all charming, had time to chat and were always cheerful. The bedroom was modern, comfortable and colorfully decorated. Breakfast is brought up on a tray. The croissants, pain au chocolat and brioche were to die for. The best we have ever eaten. I would go back simply for the pastries. Thank you to everyone who made this a happy experience. Photographs of just a few courses."

Waterside Inn,50,EXCEPTIONAL!!!,"Had lunch here today for an early 50th Birthday gift and I can only describe The Waterside Inn, the food, the service, the staff, the setting with one word…MAGNIFIQUE 👌"

Waterside Inn,50,Perfect….as always,"Admittedly I love The Waterside Inn, and it is one of my favourites… we took my Mum and Sister for their first visit and , as usual, it was perfect, both in terms of the restaurant and overnight accommodation. Beautiful food, excellent service in fabulous surroundings."

Waterside Inn,50,Incredible food and service.,This restaurant is incredible. Both my wife and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary on the 30th July. We were treated to spectacular food and service. Thanks to to Alain Roux and his amazing team for making the day so special. We will be back? Too right we will !!

Waterside Inn,50,Excellent & Very Special,"Stayed and dined for my Wife's 75th. We were last there for her 70th. They say it's not possible to improve on perfection but the staff at the Waterfront has achieved this. The attention to detail is what sets them apart. All of the staff were genuinely happy and nothing was too much trouble for them. The attention during Dinner was superb and Molly was a breath of fresh air. Needless to say that the food was exceptional, we had the Taster Menu and it would be difficult to pick a favorite dish as they were all sublime, I think the Scallop just edged it. It's not cheap but it's well worth the expense and I think that we'll return for my 75th in a few years."

Waterside Inn,50,As good as it gets!,"Wonderful food, excellent wine, super service, fantastic ambience and location, would return tmrw given the chance."

Waterside Inn,20,Unexpectedly disappointing.,Food good but the general ambiance and cavalier attitude of some of the older male staff made for a poor experience.

Waterside Inn,50,Canard a la presse,"Had a lovely Saturday lunch with lovely views of the river,we had pre ordered the canard a la presse Which was wonderfully prepared at the table by Frederic a great experience"

Waterside Inn,40,Ladies who lunch,"Our party of 18 were WI ladies from Normanton on Soar. We arrived at The Waterside Inn after a fabulous lazy trip on the canal and River Soar from Loughborough on a Peter Marchant Trust Boat. We arrived just before 12noon  a great time before the crowds arrive,    We were shown to our table which had great views of the river, and ordered pre lunch drinks which very quickly arrived  As we had already pre ordered our lunches, all we had to do was relax, chat and anticipate our lunch.    It was interesting when the lunches arrived, so many different things the ladies had ordered, all looking great.  The dessert was great anticipated, the most favourite was Panna Cotta with Mango - totally fabulous.    Unfortunately we had to leave, the boat awaits us. Thank you to all staff concerned."

Waterside Inn,50,Just another perfect Saturday lunch,"Me and my wife came here again just before the birth of our son for one last outing before the arrival. And as always faultless.    Come for a Saturday lunch, got seated out by the river as we arrived slightly early & then escorted into the dining room. As always staff polite welcoming warm friendly.    There are plenty of reviews saying just how good the food is so don’t need to explain once again at just how god the food really is here. Just love coming to the waterside and will keep doing so for the future.    Get yourself booked in for a treat!!!"

Waterside Inn,50,Luncheon,"Managed to get a table for lunch on our way back north. Not much space outside so just hand over the keys to the valet. Everything about the restaurant is top drawer, the decor, the service, the food. Yes it is expensive but you probably won't be eating here every week. Wonderful setting on the river. Will hopefully return before too long."

Waterside Inn,50,Perfect,"Perfect. We had an over night stay, perfect weather for drinks by the water and then dinner. It’s so peaceful, and a great place to unwind and watch the ducks, geese and rowers do their thing. The food was outstanding, and nothing was too much...More"

Waterside Inn,50,Brilliant,Fantastic overnight stay. Food amazing. Staff very attentive. Lovely location by the Thames. Perfect!

Waterside Inn,50,Traditional French mastery,"Very classical, very generous portions for fine dining, good service and a top rate wine list. Accommodation was also lovely, but the A/C wasn’t working."

Waterside Inn,50,Great Steak,"Had a great steak thank you Jodie chef, friendly and helpful staff, clean and tidy will definitely be back"

Vrijmoed,50,Great seven course meal,"Vrijmoed has two Michelin stars, and it's as good as most of he three-star restaurants I've had the pleasure to visit. The dishes are small but have great mouth feel and are exquisite in flavour. Two of us had the seven-course menu, the third had...More"

Vrijmoed,50,Perfect!,"Wonderful lunch served with impeccable attention to detail and genuine personal care by front of house. The food was delightful, different and demonstrated flair and passion by those who prepared it. I will definitely return on my next visit to the beautiful city of Gent!"

Vrijmoed,50,Best vegetarian gastronomic experience ever,This place is truly amazing. Although not a vegetarian I was seduced by the non meat / non fish menu.. and what an experience a had. Lovely and memorable. Thanks

Vrijmoed,50,Wow!,"Though certainly not cheap, this is an incredible restaurant. We had one of the most interesting dinners ever. It is beautifully designed, with very attentive waitstaff."

Vrijmoed,40,no surprises,"we had high expectations, which is rather obvious for a 2star rated restaurant. We decided to go for the vegetarian and for the normal Vrijmoed 6 course set menu. Setting is beautiful (tables close to each other though), staff is friendly and some are convivial also (but they forgot to present the caviar option with one of the dishes). Of the 6 courses, unfortunately only two convinced us of the 2star rating: a wonderful dish with green peas and the dish with 'sea vegetables' in the veggie menu and the mussels ravioli and the poached cod of the Vrijmoed menu. Other dishes were correct 1star level, but nothing more. Beautiful presentation. The menu price is correct at 95€/6 courses. Nice winelist at normal prices with a beautiful non-french selection."

Vrijmoed,50,An elegant and cosy place with high-end dishes and wines,"Medieval castles, impressive cathedrals, beautiful canals and restaurant Vrijmoed: all reasons to make a visit to the dynamic city Gent in Belgium. At 2 starred restaurant Vrijmoed, our team took a seat at the table right at the front window. The restaurant is quite narrow, yet cosy and is situated in a nice pink townhouse. Inside, you can find wooden elements, high doors and round mirrors. A chic place.    Upon suggestion of the staff, we started with an aperitif of the house: a red, extremely sweet drink which was very original. With our drink, we received several amuses, such as kimchi of Chinese cabbage with jalapeño and foam of wild garlic, radish marinated in ponzu and a beautiful crisp of eggplant in gold. All amuses were a delight for the eye and the taste senses. The flavors were balanced.    The sommelier poured us a nice Rose les Pruner from 2017, which had a fruity and intense taste. It went perfectly with our first dish of Easter Scheldt lobster with gelatine of lobster, yuzu and citrus. A wonderful, fresh starter. Our second started was a very interesting one. It might not sound too special, but we really advise you to try this amazing dish that we have talked about full of praise since our visit to restaurant Vrijmoed: the starter of roasted cauliflower with a sauce of pickles. This dish was simply outstanding and reminded us of flavors that would come out of grandmother’s kitchen. Especially now in general, cauliflower has a quite flat taste by itself, the intense, nutty and almost oriental deep flavors that came out of this dish made this course extra surprising and special.    A beautiful, smooth wine of Clos de la Rolet was served with the dish of beetroot and shallot. We continued our culinary journey with a course of brill fish with algae and preserved yuzu glasswort together with a full, round Bourgogne wine. Our head course of lamb from Kluisbergen, from a butcher and slaughterer in Vlaanderen, with lamb shoulder, lamb gravy and marjoram, was full of flavors. Together with the fruity and intense red Olim Baudo wine, it was a heavy dish.    The chef surprised us with one of his classics: an original sorbet of blue stilton cheese. A justified winner of the GaultMillau dish of the year 2018. The sherry-ish Barbetto wine from 2003 was a great match with the balsamico in the dish and managed to optimize the overall impression. Delicious!    Two beautiful desserts followed. The first one was a crisp of white chocolate with rhubarb, citrus and a granité of fresh basil. Most impressive was the second dessert: a spume of corn with macadamia nuts and ice cream of salted caramel. We never had a dessert made of corn before, but we are sure we have to find a way to taste a lot more of these from now on. Both desserts were of subtle taste and not to sweet. Ironically, the desserts actually were less sweet than the aperitif. However, both dishes were perfectly balanced and, especially with regard to the corn dessert, worth the visit to restaurant Vrijmoed alone.    Our dinner ended with several interesting friandises to go with our Irish coffees, such as a friandise of raspberry, red beetroot and ganache of chocolate, a pastry of oatmeal and praline of chocolate truffles.    We really liked the way how the sommelier provided us with a good story behind the choice of a certain wine. With regard to the food, the starter of roasted cauliflower and the corn dessert absolutely stood out above all other dishes with head and shoulders. In short, restaurant Vrijmoed is an elegant and cosy place where you can sit and relax for a few hours and enjoy a parade of gastronomic high-end dishes and wines."

Vrijmoed,30,"Food is delicious but not spectacular, service ice-cold, take care of up-selling","Friendly welcome, but once seated, your realise quickly the tables are too close and prevent your conversations to stay at least more or less private as your neighbours will not be able to avoid listening.    When placing your orders - beware of the up-selling of the not even particularly friendly staff. They do ok, but at least one smile here and there would really not hurt. But perhaps we have to pay extra for that as well.    Concerning the meaty menu, it was good and a bit better than the veggie one, but no 'wows' or taste explosions.  Concerning the vegetarian menu, it's ok, but really nothing special and I have eaten much better menus in some other vegetarian or vegan fine dining without any stars.  As we had one lactose intolerant person, they were able to come up with solutions, but they were very much within the known standards of 'more fruit and vegge instead' rather than an actual protein replacement.  On our question concerning this we got the response ""Well had we known"" - well actually we did made a request upon booking. But even if we hadn't, with so many people gluten and lactose intolerant today, a restaurant of this level should be prepared either way.    The wine degustation was very good though, and the wine waiter could tell interesting tales, but it was a bit sad we didn't get a smile, and instead some high-browed frowns about some of our questions.    In total we had a very good evening, because we were in good company. The food was very nice, but there was no 'wow' which I would expect for the stars and/or the price.    Nice experience, but not spectacular. We won't be back."

Vrijmoed,30,"Fantastic food, glacial service","There are many good things to say about Vrijmoed – the food was excellent & everyone we encountered was friendly and accommodating. I had some of the best vegetarian dishes of any restaurant I've every experienced.    The pace of service, however, was glacial – with some excessively long (irregularly so) gaps between courses and a particularly long wait for the bill at the end of the night. Similarly, we were subjected to the same up-selling that other reviewers have warned about — with no mention of the additional costs. There were no apologies for delays, which leads me to question whether the staff were conscious of them at all, or whether they considered it to be an acceptable level of service.    I feel like, having gained attention through their second star (deservedly so, given the quality of their food), Vrijmoed should pay attention to the overall experience for their guests – otherwise they won't be getting many return visits."

Vrijmoed,30,"One Star yes, but two?","Since I lived my whole live in gastronomy, from the cradle till now, I was expecting a lot of the V.  We were welcome very friendly, greeted by our names, handed a glass of champagne, just the way it should be.  then we went to our table and that was the first bad impression of the evening.  I know that you have to fill your restaurant, but just because of the close placing of the tables I would take away the scond star straight. Sorry but I dont want to hear the lifestory of some guy on the left, neither do i want to get touched by a callgirl on the right.    The waiter was always there for us and fullfilled all our wishes.  My girlfriend can not eat sea fruits, no problem.    The second bad thing was the waiting time on our menu.  With the restaurant about 3/4 filled, resulting in 20 people, it shouldnt take 20 minutes between dishes since they have the manpower in kitchen (thanks to glass to take a look while on hte way to the toilette).    The food was delicious, but I have eaten way better (and cheaper) in 1star Michellin restaurants.    Go there, expierence and decide for yourself.  I probably will not return."

Vrijmoed,50,One of the best in Belgium and the world!,"Amazing flavor from the best quality ingredients and even just vegetables stood out among the best restaurants.  Just a little salt. Ingredients perfectly paired to provide layers of delightful flavors. Never overly presented so that it looked a flower garden. Even the classic dishes were among the best we have tasted. Worth a special trip, again and again!"

Vrijmoed,40,"Excellent, but be careful of the up-sell","Absolutely fantastic culinary experience as you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. Great setting, lovely service. All top notch. This place is expensive as you would expect, which is ok. What was disappointing was their need to up sell you on even more outrageously priced items. A glass of bubbly at the start for 19€ each?? Really? And a very steep up charge for a tiny spoon of caviar? All this smoothly asked by the wait staff and quietly added to the bill. This should be about the culinary experience, not enhancing their profit margin. Leaves a bad aftertaste."

Vrijmoed,40,"Two stars challenge Boury - Vrijmoed : 5 - 3,5","I was so lucky this year to be invited in two different two stars restaurants for my anniversary. Vrijmoed was excellent, of course, you would not expect less… but, compared to Boury in Roeselare, I was missing the ""waw !"". Dishes were not so exceptional as expected, the pairing wine was good, but not much more (could have been a bit more in quality and in volume). We will try again within some months...because we give the chef and ourselves a second try. And little remark : it will not be on my anniversary (there was no attention at all by the Vrijmoed team for this special occasion)"

Vrijmoed,50,Michelin star experience!,"We went for lunch ( made reservation 2 weeks in advance via website) for this excellent 2 Michelin star restaurant and we love every minute of it , service and food was excellent trough out . Just a tip - order apperetive , cos you going to get up to 4 complimentary dishes with it and lunch menu was really good and affordable for this classy place."

Vrijmoed,50,Fabulous!,"This was our second visit - the first was last time we were in Ghent, three years ago. Happily for us, this occasion was even better than the first. Every mouthful was delicious and the wines were very well matched. Superb service too. Can’t recommend too highly - go if you can."

Vrijmoed,40,Not as ‘wow’ as I had expected,My colleague and me had lunch at Vrijmoed. Service and atmosphere: excellent! Food: not as surprising/astonishing as I had hoped for. I’ve had a much bigger ‘wow’ feeling at other Michelin star restaurants. I wouldn’t come back for that reason.

Vrijmoed,40,Excellent 2 star restaurant,Excellent restaurant in the centre of ghent. We did not take the menu but had some extremely good tasting starters and main course. For me the dessert (chocolate and chicory) was a bit too adventurous. But we will go back for sure

Vrijmoed,50,Amazing food and service,"Unbelievably good food and service. This restaurant is worth the rating of two Michelin stars.  The service from the moment you walk through the door is incredibly good. The degustation with matching wines was exquisite.  Every dish comes with an explanation of its content, then the sommelier introduces each wine in detail. My wife only drinks white wine, it was no trouble for him to adjust to her taste, which just added to our enjoyment.  This would be the best meal we have had anywhere in the world.  If visiting Ghent book ahead to enjoy a sublime experience"

Vrijmoed,50,Absolutely worth it,"My friend and I took a day trip to Ghent during our 4-day trip in Brussels. I booked lunch at Vrijmoed, the only restaurant with 2 Michelin stars in Ghent, well in advance.    The entrance of Vrijmoed was discreet. We even needed to press the bell outside in order to be let into the building where the restaurant is located.    We picked the Menu Vrijmoed with 4 courses. The food turned out to be the best we'd during our trip to Belgium. All the dishes were beautifully presented, prepared with the finest seasonal ingredients, nicely executed and highly delicious. I particularly loved the entree of North Sea shrimps and the main course of roasted pheasant with salsify and wild mushrooms.    We each added a cheese course which was served before our dessert. It's Stilton ice cream with crumble and a piece of bread with Stilton in its traditional form.    The service was impeccable. Just like what we can and should expect from a restaurant of this class.    Our meal wasn't cheap. However, given all the good things which I mentioned above, it's good value for money.    I'll eat at Vrijmoed again if I happen to travel to Ghent again in the future."

Vrijmoed,50,An Amazing Dining Experience,"I was travelling in Europe feom the Philippines and Belgium was on my list. Saw Brussels, Antwerp,Bruges but for Ghent I only came for Restaurant Vrijmoed.    As a tourist on a rent a car, It wasn’t easy to spot Restaurant Vrijmoed from the street because their sign was small but google map pointed me to the right direction.    I tried reserving for dinner but they were fully booked and was lucky they had an available table lunchtime the next day.    Place was beautiful. Not overly decorated, elegant and yet simple.    Service was very professional. Service people were all clean looking and very knowledgeable about the dishes.    The Appetizers was the first that came out and that really set the bar pretty high. The flavors were excellent and amazing. Everything that followed was a supprised. I was with my nephew and we both had a Grastonomical experience.    After each dish we were excited to see what the next dish would be. They explained everything in english. It was one of my best dining experience.    A must try for everyone visiting Belgium."

Vrijmoed,50,OUTSTANDING RESTAURANT. ONE OF THE BEST DINNERS OF MY LIFE.,"We arrived in Ghent for a 10 day vacation in Belgium and Amsterdam. I read many TA reviews of all of the Michelin star restaurants. Vrijmoed has two stars, and more importantly to me, they have a vegetarian tasting menu. I read some TA reviews where people said Michael Vrijmoed did things with vegetables that were so unique and delicious, we just had to go to this restaurant. But we also eat fin and scale fish (not shellfish), so I wanted to have some in this dinner. The best way to deal with dietary requirements is to send your own e-mail to Michael Vrijmoed. He answers the e-mails. So I asked Michael for two fish courses in this tasting menu. He was happy to oblige.  We came at 7pm; opening time for the restaurant. We looked at the wine list. I asked the very capable service team if the Gamey at 61E, the least expensive bottle of the reds, was still a good wine for the money. They assured me that it wouldn't be on their wine list if the wine wasn't a good representative of gamey. I told them I drink Pinot Noir often. They told me this wine would work well, since the wine is produced in a very similar way. They were right! They start the dinner (after serving the wine and bread), with 4 amuse bouche, served separately. The portion is very small ( as it should be), but we knew we were in for a fantastic dining experience. Then the actual tasting menu dinner started. This is what we had:  Zucchini ""grilled"" avocado-wild garlic  Codfish ""Poached"" algae-yuzu  Portobello 'baked' green tee-pine  Seabass eggplant-fennel  Tomme De Pyrenees green tomato-mustard  Spinach white chocolate-citrus  Apricot almond-amarula  We ordered tea with the two deserts. At 287E, this dinner was a very similar experience to Eleven Madison Avenue. And at this price, I can honestly say I was happier.  The food is delicious. The ambience is lovely. The service team is very capable and nice!  What a great way to start a vacation!"

Vrijmoed,30,Not impressed,"I've lunched and dined in several Michelin starred restaurants, but this was probably the most average of them.    After I pointed out to one of the staff members that I am allergic to hard cheeses, I was served a first little bite with parmesan cheese (by another staff member, who looked like the 'head waiter'). He seemed annoyed that I asked for a version without the cheese topping. Maybe the staff should communicate more, especially in a two star restaurant. Actually, the whole staff didn't seem to enjoy their work. Haven't seen a lot of genuine smiles, which is quite deplorable.    The food was mostly good, with some awesome dishes like the spinach - lemon - white chocolate dessert, but also several disappointments, like the fish with seaweed that was way too salt or the vegetarian mushroom main that was just bland.    If you play in the top league, you have to be able to take some criticism. Maybe it just wasn't the staff's best day (cooks included), but with 2 stars you have to deliver the best. Every day. And with enthusiastic staff that can smile genuinely."

Vrijmoed,50,Excellent!,"Definitely one of the most excellent Michelin restaurants I have been to. Very creative dishes and wonderful taste. The staffs are also very friendly. Even though it's quite pricy and worth a try. We had the 4 courses lunch menu. It was all great. I didnt feel like lamb so they changed to a fish dish. And yes, it was awesome!"

Vrijmoed,50,"Excellent, excellent, excellent","Came here for lunch and had the 3-course chef's menu, along with an optional 4th course and the wine pairings. Everything was amazing and delicious. The chef came out at the end of the meal and was very gracious. The food was somewhat experimental (pecan grasshopper crackers, Stilton cheese ice cream) can utterly amazing. I wasn't a fan of the herring course, but that's because I'm not a big fan of fish in general and rarely (if ever) eat sushi but the lamb was astounding. It's expensive, but i thought it worth the price. The service was appropriately snobbish but the sommelier was friendly."

Vrijmoed,50,The place to make your tastebuds love you,"We went there twice for birthdays. The second Michelin star has been given here for very solid reasons!  If you have any dietary restrictions just tell them when making a reservation - you'll be taken care off perfectly!  You can either chose separate dishes or go for an x-course menu.  By default, there's always vegetarian menu as a version of the x-course menu.  But if you want your dish to be vegan of glutenfree or both - there's no problem.  Every dish will be announced, presented and described in detail. The accompanying wine as well.  Expect the unexpected!  That's the place for"

Vrijmoed,50,Superb veggie menu!!,"Tried the awarded veggie menu. I'm not a vegetarian but I liked to try it.  Don't hesitate: A seven course veggie taste bud experience will await you! Commonly the veggie options in a restauarant are not the most tasty or surpringing ones.. mostly they are okay.  I believe it takes a lot of creativity and  inventiveness from the chef to create a dish that is savory and full of taste, veggie dishes often lacks. Well.. Michaël Vrijmoed exceeded all my expectations!! He created 7 (why did I only try 6? stupid me) dishes which stands on its own, but melt together in a perfect harmony. If I have to choose a favorite.. hmm I would choose the algae with black tea and tofu.. I know these tastes.. I thought.. but don't be fooled like me.. it will blow you from your socks. Should you wear any.. Or.. the Gorgonzola sorbet..yes.. or... Well Try It Yourself! No dissapointments here, scouts honor :)"

Vrijmoed,50,Wonderful meal,"Everything about this place was great from start to finish. Friendly and professional staff, lovely dining rooms, and an interesting and innovative menu. We kicked off with a fabulous gin cocktail (they have their own label gin) before settling in for a tasting menu treat. Delicious and delicate amuse bouche were followed by several courses, each one executed perfectly and brilliantly matched by the sommelier. We had a table near the pass, so I could see the finishing touches being made to the plates, which was great. A truly wonderful dining experience, well worth a trip to Ghent!  We actually bumped in to the sommelier at a church service 2 days later - he remembered us and came over to greet us again. Such a genuinely lovely chap."

Vrijmoed,50,What a nice restaurant!,"Always difficult to say 'Best' but for sure, one of the best. Very kind personel, very good information and service about the menu possibilities and, most important, such a lovely food! Enjoyed every taste of it and the wine was excellent! When can I go back?"

Vrijmoed,50,Best restaurant in Ghent,"The two Michelin stars are well deserved; this is easily Ghent's finest restaurant. The flavours are incredibly strong and sometimes unexpected. If you stick with the three-course lunch, the price/quality ratio is quite good.  The acoustics are the only downside to the restaurant; it's noisy, so don't expect a really romantic feeling. But it's the food you're there to get to know."

Vrijmoed,50,Michelin star with a casual atmosphere,"For our 15th wedding anniversary we decided to discover Ghent and treat us at this Michelin star restaurant. It’s one of the beautiful town houses which makes Ghent so special and it feels very homey. The service is very professional but at the same time amiable and last but not least the food is delicious. It was no issue to adjust the menu to my nut allergy and we enjoyed every single course. My least favorite (still really good) is the cheese surprise in the middle). Don’t forget to order a coffee or tea in the end, it comes with a lovely selection of sweets. However bad the weather was, we decided to stroll along the beautiful streets of Ghent afterwards before heading back to the B&B"

Vrijmoed,50,One of my best 2017 culinary experiences!,"Very creative cuisine, with some Japanese touches, original degustation menu with options, small and very reasonably priced wine list (could have a few more options in my opinion), great staff & attention, with the very nice touch of the chef himself coming to the table (which is per se not different from other top restaurants) commenting they it’s his team and not only himself (very humble!) who gave us such an unforgettable evening. Will be back for sure, this is top cuisine and service!!"

Vrijmoed,50,Second well deserved Michelin Star,"Fine dining at it's best. Sophisticated well balanced dishes, delightful plating, intriguing flavour combinations, wow! Very good wine pairings. Relaxed atmosphere, comfortable surroundings, friendly service. An allround top notch dining experience."

Vrijmoed,20,"Not really a ""wow"" effect, on the contrary.","Reception was friendly, without any doubt.  The tables are really very close to another, so that we could not only follow the conversation next to us, but also behind us and in front of our table. Very disturbing.....  Service was not really friendly, only polite..... The ""maitre d'hotel"" was very friendly to some people he obviously knew..... The sommelier did his job in a friendly and polite way but without any enthousiasm.  Then the food itself: (6 course menu)  Combinations are too extreme. Who puts carrots on a dessert and mushroom and parsley on another..... ?  We ate chips form algue..... Probabely difficult to make but totally tasteless. We had ""Northseacrab"" also with algue. (the crab was a tiny little piece of 2 square inch.....)  The main course was pheasant. 4 tiny little pieces of meat with tiny chicory and mushrooms and that is called a main course....  I ate all over the world, but for a 1 star restaurant (in the mean time 2 - I wonder why) it was really disappointing.  I really was still hungry after dinner due to the very small portions.  I now a lot of restaurants (without a star) where you eat better for less money.  Still a long way to go before reaching the level of ""Hof van Cleve""......"

Vrijmoed,40,must do,"Excellent food, nice setting, attentive and professional staff. Personal attention of Chef is appreciated."

Vrijmoed,50,"Perfect Food, Ambiance and Service","We spent three days in Ghent and were fortunate to get a reservation at Vrijmoed. It was the highlight and the best food during our stay in Belgium and Paris. You immediately feel welcomed by the host. The attention to detail by the head of the dining room was incredible. There was nothing the he did not miss . When we asked for a table in the middle dining room for our special 50th anniversary dinner he made us feel as if it as the simplest of requests. We did the 7 course tasting menu. I did the vegetarian and my husband the regular menu. We had wines to match . The pre appetizer consisted of cauliflower three ways - the humble cauliflower has never been so exalted. Who needs fish or firs gras when you can you chef can develop flavors so rich and varied from a single vegetable . The rest of the meal proceeded at the same pace - always surprising the palate - never too rich - . The wines were also a journey to many areas - Corsica Portugal France ... All generously poured by the friendliest of wine waiters. The restaurant strikes the balance between food of the very highest quality and yet with service that makes you feel at home and so welcome. The chef came out at the end of the meal - sometimes I find this to be a hard exchange but at vrijmoed it was like talking with a friend. He was warm and engaging and most of all so very genuine, It was the highlight of our trip and far exceeded any one star we ate at in Paris. It was incredible value for the very highest quality food., We loved our stay in Ghent, It is such a special city. How we wish we had a restaurant of this caliber in our home owns of San Diego and San Francisco ."

Hof van Cleve,50,Perfection in the Belgian countryside,"Undoubtedly one of the great restaurants of the world. In an idyllic rural Belgian setting, Hoff van Cleeve is as close to restaurant perfection as I can imagine is possible. It helped that our visit was on a beautiful Spring day, allowing “snacks” and sparkling wine to be served on the terrace. But once we moved inside for the set menu with selected wines, the perfection continued. Service was perfect, friendly and informative, the food beautifully prepared, looking spectacular without ostentatious innovation, and with a wonderful range of tastes. With help from the waiter, I turned the set menu into a pescatarian menu by substituting one dish. There was also a vegetarian menu that sounded exciting. We are pleased to have eaten there before Chef Goosenns, whom we had the pleasure to meet, moves on at the end of the year."

Hof van Cleve,50,When Magic happens (again)!,"Once again, what a marvellous trip through Peter and his team's know-how !  For our second visit at Hof Van Cleve, we decided to keep on choosing the ""Frisheid van de Natuur"" menu, with the selected wines. We were stunned, even more than the first time.  The wine pairing was worth the money, all selections from M. Tom Leven were blowing and the result with so nice dishes have let us unforgettable memories !    Thank you so much to the whole Team, thank you to Lieve for her kind welcome. Thanks to this world of perfection, we spent a memorable evening! My Dear Parents will forever remember their 70th Birthday present."

Hof van Cleve,50,3 Michelin star perfection,"service wise: a very well oild machine.  Champagne and amuses arriving all perfectly at same time.  Perfect wine pairing. Great variety of home made breads. Great pastry charriot for the coffee.Beautiful cheeses, great winelies... all as to be expected from a 19.5/20 in Gault&Millau and 3 Michelin stars.  Excellent tasting menu, everything cooked to perfection, started very asian fusion, but towards the end of the menu, the asian fusion aspect was gone, so not very consistent. All cuisons were amazingly perfect.  I just thought that there was a bit too little time between courses, i never had the time to finish my glass before we were already served the next wine and dish, as all very rapid. Just over 2H for a 6-course fine dining menu is really quick.    Overall excellent, but not my best 3* experience. we were missing the wow factor here, which we did have in another 3* restaurant and several 2*.  410 euro menu / 560 with wine pairing is expensive, even at this level."

Hof van Cleve,50,Exquisite Experience in a world of perfection !,"Absolutely amazing ! We were 4 and went for the full Menu (6 main courses) including the wine suggestions. Never in my life I have felt that much comfortable with a Dutch team speaking French so fluently and always taking care of us. Top service, more than excellence in every dish, pre-warmed plates, divine home-made desserts, top-of-the-range wine suggestions, many additional service on demand,… what else ? In one word as in hundred : gorgeous. A bill of 2.450 € for 4 persons that let us absolutely delighted. We will for sure come back again. Thank you Peter Goossens and thank you to your full Team ! You made our evening as well as our month, probably. 😉"

Hof van Cleve,30,Small portions,"The food was good but the portion where too small to my opinion. So yeah, if you are very hungry i wouldn't recommend to got there. But for the experience it's really fun."

Hof van Cleve,50,Bijou,"An elegant, unforgettable jewel of a restaurant. Everything was brilliant starting with the amazing food, the wine, the settings, the service and the ambiance. One cannot dine better than this."

Hof van Cleve,20,"The service often spoiled the culinary experience, badly overpriced compared to other Michelin ** or *** restaurants",They have changed Sommelier and the new one would not even rate high in a bistro: glasses remained empty for way too long (even though very pricey bottle)

Hof van Cleve,50,The Best,This is just the best restaurant I have ever eaten at ! Beautiful countryside place with chic decor. I especially liked that they are serving lots of seafood and vegetables. Refined flavors and combinations.

Hof van Cleve,50,A modest lunch in Flanders.,"Imagine driving around rural Flanders of a warm late winter morning. You’re in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by fields, chickens, and the odd goat or horse. Suddenly, hunger strikes, so, what do you do? There’s not much around, let alone any eateries.  In Kruishoutem, one place did happen to be nearby. An unassuming small farmhouse, surrounded by hedges, with a rather well filled parking place and a shiny metal plaque by the front gate bearing the words “Hof Van Cleve”.  Of course, far from being the intrepid explorers described above, we had booked a table. This proved no easy feat. Indeed, the occasion for which we had booked – this reviewer’s 33rd birthday – was ten days ago. However, booking allowed us to clear up some pesky little details such as one of our party’s bivalve mollusc allergy and the fact that another of our party uses a wheelchair, which we had forgotten that day. None of these issues proved to be a problem, as the menu would be adapted and the restaurant is wheelchair accessible, apart from maybe the lavatory, which they had warned us about.  We were welcomed by a lady, probably the chef’s wife, and a brace of elegant young people in dark blue suits. The interior is spartan, at best. Terracotta tiles, off-white walls, with charcoal drawings of scenes from Disney’s Jungle Book. The atmosphere is nice. The dozen or so inside tables generate a nice buzz, not too loud, and not too hushed, as is sometimes the case in illustrious temples of eating, as this establishment is rumoured to be.  A young man showed us to our table and provided little stools for our bags. We were offered an aperitive and given menus. Two of the menus are a surprise and there is a third one where you do know what you will be getting. Of course, one can always eat à la carte, but, where’s the fun in that?  Before long, as we were pondering just which surprise to go for, we were given a mise en bouche. A little bowl of deep green soup. The soup was in fact a purée of langoustines with chicken consommé and a coulis of green herbs. It was accompanied by Naan bread with langoustines marinated in lime with pomegranate seeds and goat’s cheese. Interesting, let’s see…  Of course, the trouble with a place like “Hof Van Cleve” is that there is a good chance of it being highly overrated.  It isn’t.  From the very first spoonful of this green “goo”, you realise you are somewhere special. The flavours mix perfectly, and the seasoning is really just so. It is really very difficult to go on about a dish when there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  At some point, a young lady came with a very well stocked trolley of breads. All artisanal, all freshly made. We opted for different sorts, some with local beer, some with spelt. At one point we had focaccia. She would come back several times, between each course, but after the third time, we said we had had enough bread, for fear of not being able to enjoy the remainder of our four-course meal with five mises en bouche.  Our lunch went on with smoked grilled catfish, with miso soup and sake ice cream. Now, I’ve enjoyed the odd miso soup in my life, but, our host, Mr. Goossens could really teach the Japanese a thing or two about making a nice flavourful miso soup.  We then were given a small tataki of barely seared Holstein beef, with Aubergine caviar and green curry sauce. Again, it is difficult to come up with superlatives which do justice to this small dish.  For our – sadly, for you could just carry on eating like this all day, with Mr. Goossens spoon-feeding you little bits of whatever he would care to come up with - final mise en bouche, we travelled to Spain, with a small portion of grilled octopus with chorizo and espuma of comté cheese and an ajo blanco. Again, this was a nice way of eating, and Mr. Goossens could definitely teach the Spanish about tapas.  After all that, it was time for our actual food. The three of us went for the “Marktwandeling” menu, which conjures up an image of a nice Flemish housewife going to the market, picking up nice fresh local produce and rustling up what she can come up with and plating it up for her guests.  Being lunch, we opted for the variant with infusions and juices, instead of wines, paired to each dish.  The first starter was tartar of scallops, with sorrel, avocado and a hint of coriander. These were wrapped in slices of potato, cannelloni style and came with a juice of granny smith apple. This was served with a juice of Granny Smith Apple mixed with Earl Grey tea and extra Bergamot flavour for good measure. The dish was excellent and the pairing with the drink was a match made in heaven.  Our Pectenophobic friend, instead, was given cannelloni of avocado, lentils, apple and amaranth, with a balsamic vinegar flourish, wrapped in bellota ham, which she was very happy with too.  We next had a fish dish of turbot with grilled leek, a mousse of coriander and some hummus, and a bit of smoked eel. This came with a nice fennel broth. All of this was very well matched with a fennel and lovage iced tea.  The next dish was chicken, with Jerusalem artichoke with Mimolette crumble caramelised quenelle of chicons, maize purée and gravy, with a splash of Jerusalem artichoke espuma. This dish, which redefines the meaning of chicken, was stupendously paired with an infusion of celeriac with a large frozen ball of tonic water and a few drops of verbena oil.  Two of us had the dessert of caramelised pineapple, hibiscus ice cream and some sort of sponge. The plate was finished of with the thinnest disk of white chocolate. This was paired with a juice of hibiscus and red fruits and extremely tart balls of frozen yuzu sorbet. This is not a drink for people who are a bit wet behind the ears.  The third one of us had cheese. We all had some and selected four out of a vast chariot of cheeses stocked to the brim with the spoils of what should probably go down in history as the Great Cheese Shop Burglary.  We then had coffee. Even our espressos were delicious, but we have come to learn that Mr. Goossens could probably serve you a boiled egg or a Croque Monsieur and you would have to pick your lower jaw off the floor. When offered a second coffee, we just jumped at the chance.  Evidently, the restaurant has a very busy pastry chef, as after we had finished our coffee, they came around with a trolley as well stocked as the earlier chariot of cheeses. And that was after the lemon Madeleine and warm deep-fried sugary beignets!  Finally, the man of the hour came around, and we paid our respects to him, and to his cooking, which he has truly elevated into an art form!  Finally, on learning that this reviewer had moved one step closer to decrepitude, the waitress came with an extra dessert of a ball of vanilla ice cream, with red fruit coulis and covered in soft meringue, with a single lit golden candle, and congratulated him on his birthday. A nice touch!  To sum up, then, you can go to Hof Van Cleve for lunch. You will have excellent, friendly, but non-fussy service. You will have food which has to be tasted to be believed, and unusually for many restaurants of this class, or slightly lower class, you will eat plenty.  The only problem is, what the heck will you have for supper that day?  In our case, insalata caprese and pasta aglio e olio!"

Hof van Cleve,50,a must,food served like you've never experienced before. Excellent wines. But the food is a luxury holiday for your taste.

Hof van Cleve,50,Certainly worth its 3 Michelin stars,"There is little to add to all the positive reviews, I don’t understand the negatives on the ambiance which was just perfect. We had the 7 course menu plus cheese and the endless friandises that are all made in a surprisingly small kitchen. An enormous number of amuses. As expected, we are real fans, all was perfect, of course tempting to compare top Michelin restaurants, but the great thing is they are all so different. It was an honor to have Peter Goossens at the table and have a nice chat with him."

Hof van Cleve,50,Fantastic food and juices but some issues.,We had a great lunch and a lovely experience but although we advised the restaurant upfront abt my fish allergy and the headwaiter confirmed it before service I was served bonito flakes (to my understanding that is Tuna=fish) and lateron the langustine was accompanied by eel. Both dishes were replaces but it shouldn’t happen in this top restaurant. Highlight are certainly the juices and infusions which accompanied the 7course lunch. I am a wine lover but I was pleasantly surprised by this alternative.

Hof van Cleve,50,Splendid,"Looking for a place where art and culinary craftmanship meet ?You found it !!! This is the way "" gastronomy"" should and can be, no compromises to obtain the final result "" a culinary orgasm "". Thanks to the whole team for this beautiful expirience."

Hof van Cleve,50,Top restaurant,"A unique experience.  Upon entering you will be warmly welcomed. The staff is very competent, very professional and super friendly with a sense of humor.  It is absolutely no stiff fuss, you are really at ease. The menu and the adapted wines were delicious, a true culinary delight. The plates were very well presented, a delight to the eye.  Worth repeating. Highly recommended.  Congratulations to Peter Goossens and his team!"

Hof van Cleve,30,Nice but I expected it better.,"To get a table in the weekend you must make reservations weeks in advance. The interior is clean and simple but 'cold' not cozy !! Small windows with heavy curtains, so you can forget enjoying the rural view.To me the table was not inviting: 4 plates (we were a party of 4) and a kind of vase in the middle. Nothing more. I expected the bread served warm , but no ! I had to ask for the olive oil since I prefer that to butter. During dinner we had always different waiters. Rarely I noticed the same guy or girl a second time at our table. Almost all the dishes were served with a sauce or kind of broth at the side, which means the waiter serves you a small spoon of it. Ask for somewhat more and they look at you like this is 'not done'. Food was tasty but for that price I expected it better. Chef Peter Goossens came to say hello at every table. Compared to La Pergola (Rome) which also has 3 michelin stars, La Pergola is much better and prices are much lower. Of course the view is La Pergola is unique, but only taken into account the interior: La Pergola is 100 times more inviting and cozy. Plus they serve beside butter very good olive oil; you also get a choice of at least 5 different kind of salts and you get warm bread, plus their staff is extremely friendly !!!Compared to La Chèvre d'or in Eze (France) with only 2 michelin stars, Hof van Cleve is loosing once again. To conclude: it was a nice experience, we had a lovely evening, food was good, but my expectations were much higher for that price."

Hof van Cleve,50,Again and again and again world class experience,Since years Peter Goossens is the absolute king of Belgian and world cuisine. What a genius in combining flavors and art on your plate. After all this years still in my all time top three together with Gagan in Bangkok and Alinea in Chicago. Proud of this Belgian Masterchef

Hof van Cleve,50,Special Family reunion,"The location is fantastic with a beautiful vista of a southern Belgian valley. The meal began with creative starters on the outdoor garden patio. The main courses proceeded indoors with a surrounding that oozed classic rustic charm combined with some modern art pieces, particularly noticeable in the avant-garde dinnerware. The food itself is top shelf and exquisite here, as expected for a 3 star Michelin restaurant. Most dishes featured seafood and pefectly in season accompanying ingredients , with veal being the only meat course prior to lavish dessert options to round out the meal. Overall, the flavors and presentaion delivered the goods. The executive chef came out to meet and greet us in fone form. My only criticisms are that some more exotic ingredients may be in order going forward to maintain their high stature, and the service was a bit uneven with some excellent wait staff, but also some junior inexperienced staff that lacked flair and precision. In conclusion, a top meal for anyone and probably still the best restaurant in all of Belgium. Worth an excursion for sure."

Hof van Cleve,50,Peter Goossens deserves his three stars,"The three star price is something you just have to accept when the quality is outstanding. The service is matching, basically it is flawless. Our sommelier Matthieu Vanneste(?) was able to provide this group of wine afficionados with some excellent choices."

Hof van Cleve,50,Exquisite,"We visited the restaurant with a group of 8, of which some of us had specific needs (allergies). Each of the needs was treated with respect, without judgement. Atmosphere is calm, relaxed and professional. Food is pure delight, service is impeccable. Truly one of the best restaurants in the world."

Hof van Cleve,30,Superb staff however overpriced expected much more from a 3 star,"Beautiful location, superb friendly staff. Food was good especially the desserts however the price of drinks does not meet the quality and is overpriced (e.g 20 eur for orange juice). Price for 7 courses is also ridiculous.    Food is more traditional styled and does not stand out as on other 3 Michelin star restaurants such as Hertog-Jan.    The dining room was very plain and monochromatic, expected much more from a 3 star considering the pricing."

Hof van Cleve,50,Always Outstanding,"We always try to have lunch here on Dutch King’s Day. Most every body takes the tasting menu. We wanted to keep it much more simple. A bit of lobster (Oosterschelde, the best), Some wagyu with french fries, and a dame blance to end. Why having such a meal at a three star michelin ? Because in simple classics there is No place to hide. And boy was it good, best ingredients full of taste. A meursault by coche dury and a chambolle musigny by denis mortet and we were in heaven. The chef comes to have a little talk at each table, No rush, extremely friendly. The service was of course three stars. Will be back many times."

Hof van Cleve,50,Birthday,"We visited Hof van Cleve, as birthday gift. We started with 4 small tasters before the real 7-course dinner got served.  Around 30 people fit in the restaurant, what makes the expirience very exclusive.  We loved all courses and the selection of wines. Also keep some room for a great selection of cakes, pies and biscuites with the coffee."

Hof van Cleve,30,"Good, unfortunately too expensive","Let me start by saying the cuisine is excellent.    Dining room could use a bit of an update, for me it lacks atmosphere. Walls are snowwhite and the art on the walls consists of what on first glance looks like empty frames.    Dishes are beautifully presented and well made, although not very memorable.    Service is very good, but a tad aloof.    What made me give Hof van Cleve only a three star review is the price. I don't mind paying for excellence, but with a € 415 pricetag for the seven course menu and € 20 for a mint tea after dinner, I expect to be blown away.  The 13 course menu lunch at The Jane set me back just over €250 and was a lot more fun and more memorable."

Hof van Cleve,50,Sublime,"Yes, it is very very expensive. Get over it. The restaurant is very intimate, the service staff does a fabulous job and the food is both inspiring and perfect. It's a world class experience and it deserves three Michelin stars and 19,5 from Gault Millau. If it's not on your bucket list, then add it (several times)."

Hof van Cleve,50,Best. Meal. Ever.,"Hof van Cleve remained one of those mythical places that I swore I'd visit one day. Now, having had dinner in this remarkable restaurant, I can't find the words that do justice to the fantastic experience we had.    I booked this evening about half a year in advance, so we had some time to look forward to our dinner. We started out on the patio, given the excellent weather we had. Small appetizers came and went, after which we took place inside for the actual meal. Seven courses and some extra desserts and coffee later, I honestly wondered if going to a restaurant will ever feel the same. The flavors were pure but intense; the service was excellent, tending to our every need; the wine was outstanding and well paired with the dishes.    I could describe each course in detail, but by the time you get here the menu will have changed. I cannot recommend this place enough, and despite the quite hefty price tag I feel it was worth every cent I paid."

Hof van Cleve,50,Wonderful,We had the market lunch and it was a wonderful pause in our busy dats. Dishes were exciting and well ececuted and offered an interesting variety of flavors. We were a bit disappointed with the coffee being nespresso though.

Hof van Cleve,50,Culinary apex.,"If you like art you should see the Mona Lisa, the David or the sunflowers. If you like food you must visit this place. There are no superlatives enough to describe what they do over here. My deepest respect for this fantastic chef and his crew. All the stars well deserved, year after year."

Hof van Cleve,50,Outstanding,"Traditionally I visit this restaurant for lunch on the Dutch Koningsdag. It is the living proof that location is not important when the service and quality offered is outstanding. A small farmhouse in the middle of the fields, nothing fancy, simple mostly white interior. Nothing takes the attention away from what comes on the plate and that remains outstanding. The ""large"" menu is not cheap (325) but is just great. Beautifully presented, mostly seafood with Anjou pigeon as the meat course. What is striking is that over time the cooking by Goosens has become much simpler with even better ingredients that sing without having to add complexity. This is a major accomplishment. Service impeccable. Outstanding winelist fairly priced. Still lunch for 3 without exaggerating on the wine 1,600 euro. Not for everyday. Until next year ."

Hof van Cleve,50,The Best!!!,"It's located out of Brussels, but we didn't regret. The food was just perfect, I can not expect more. From the starter to dessert, it's really well prepared and using the best quality and fresh. I will come back again for next trip."

Hof van Cleve,50,Top!,"Top food, top service, top atmosphere, what do you need more? Definitely the place to check out when in the neighborhood."

Hof van Cleve,50,Review,"For my dad’s 50th birthday, my mom organized a dinner party with friends at the Hof van Cleve. It is located in a quiet and beautiful area. We could choose a five or seven course menu. We took the seven courses ‘Freshness of nature’. They were all small plates with fresh seasonal vegetables. There was originally dealt with flavours and colours of the vegetables. The restaurant has an abstract interior with pale colours. All the waiters wear a suit and have a well-groomed look. They adapt to the audience they can be serious but they also like to make jokes. Something which is also really nice, the chef Peter Goossens comes to every table to greet his guests and to ask how the food was.  For me it was a very fun and unique experience, everything was taken care of, the food is delightful and appealing. I recommend it to everyone!"

Hof van Cleve,50,"The best. Simply the best. In Belgium, in Europe, in the world as far as we know.","For those who want to know with who I am compairing it, please check my other reviews. The food is the best. It is not avant garde. The downside: the price. It was the most expensive restaurant in Belgium before, and now it has made his prices even higher. A lot higher. But it's still worth it. Too bad I can't afford to eat there once a month. We appreciate the chef coming to all the tables, the very informative sommelier, the fine art on the walls, the perfect table setting, the fact that quantities are enough so that you can actually taste everything, that they are generous in many ways, the fine wines, all of it. But the food is the number 1."

Hof van Cleve,50,Heavenly,"What an experience! Everything was perfect. Wonderful sensations for your eyes and palate. Friendly service, you feel at ease as from the beginning. Fine wines are poured generously. A higher level than any other michelin starred restaurant I visited."

Hof van Cleve,30,Not met the expectations,The best aspect is this restaurant is the kidness of the service staff who really do an excellent job . Unfortunately the 7 course diner did not met my expectations . Price quality overrated for what you get .

Hof van Cleve,50,The best of the best.,"Since we are living close to the Hof van Cleve, we regularly go there for special occasions. For me, this is the top of gastronomy. Everything is made to perfection. Impeccable and very friendly service. Of course the price is high, but money well spent.  You can choose between the menu and à la carte. I would recommend the grilled Turbot with a Lobster Béarnaise. The Dame Blanche as dessert is the best in the world. This restaurant is definitely the very best in Belgium."

Hof van Cleve,50,Perfect,"Absolute top. In all details. We had very high expectations, and they all came true. World class from the moment we entered till the moment we left. 3 star Michelin plus."

Hof van Cleve,40,Coffee was a sad ending to the menu.,"I visited the restaurant a couple of times. Food is very fine and high quality.  The interior is missing something, too much distilled.  We had the 5 course menu for two persons and payed 770€.  I was very very much disappointed about the coffee.The coffee was only served with 6 very small Dutch doughnuts and a cake called Madeleine. Nothing else was served, no chocolate, no sweets, nothing extra. Not worthy for a three Michelin stars i think, but i can be wrong and maybe it fits in the concept of the interior that is also extremely is distilled."

Hof van Cleve,50,Fully lives up to its reputation,"The cuisine here is creative and delicious, service is attentive and considerate, and the dress code is informal, making this a relaxed, pleasant and unpretentious setting for a truly great culinary experience. The fields surrounding this elegant fermette are sown with a unique display of cornflowers, poppies, daisies and other wild flowers. The lunch menu offers a (relatively) inexpensive option."

Hof van Cleve,50,the best restaurant of belgium !,"we went for the 3th time, but now on saturday noon. price quality is this for me the best restaurant of Belgium or even Europe. verry high end. a wine list that blows you away and the plates are pieces of art that explodes inside you mouth.  we went for the 5 courses menu including the wines. top top top. also the hospitaliy is amazing !"

Hof van Cleve,50,clean,before lunch we enjoyed the (finally) nice weather on the terrasse with an aperitif and a bunch of beautiful snacks. our Little Girl drank her 20 euro (!) iced tea with us. the menu was very nice as were the Sommelier and our main Server. a very pleasant and compared to non-belgian 3 star Restaurants expensive afternoon that we enjoyed very much.

Hof van Cleve,50,Perfect !!!,"This is what I call a WOW restaurant because of the amazing service, fantastic wines and orgasmic food. Except to other people I had no problem to pay nearly 100€ for coffee and digestive (for 2 persons of course). First of all you don't have to go there if you want to save money, we can not compare the prices with other restaurants because the chef has to pay his super team for the super job they do and I suppose it's more expensive than we can imagine. Sometimes you have to wait a bit, fortunately, because it's a pleasure to wait for the super-food, usually it takes time to prepare it and normally you go there to spend a good time and enjoy every single second not just to grab something before to take the train. Very good value for money for such an exclusive food. Thank you for the magic dinner!"

Hof van Cleve,50,Perfect.,The cooking at Hof van Cleve is simply amazing. It is very complex as far as technique and finesse goes. Every dish offers a number of pleasant flavors and combinations. Each serving is unique and offers a new range of flavors. Wine pairings are perfect. A dinner at Hof van Cleve is with every penny!

Hof van Cleve,50,Perfection at a whole new level,"By far the best *** restaurant I have ever been to (about 10 times!). Atmosphere, staff, every single item, dish, ingredient are out of this world. Every plate is a work of art, every bite a trip to Nirvana."

Hof van Cleve,50,Top class !!,"I feel obliged to write this review in english , because i' m Proud that a small county like Belgium houses one of the best restaurants in the world. Everything is perfect , from the amuses to the desert trolley , The flavour and amount of manhours in Every plate are astounding. I'ts worth the voyage ..indeed"

Hof van Cleve,50,Wonderful as previously and highly recommended,"We missed our initial lunch booking due to delays with the Eurotunnel however Mrs Goossens was very understanding when we called, and kindly agreed to change our booking to dinner instead for that evening.  We received a very warm welcome and were immediately seated and received efficient and friendly service from an experienced and professional team.    Every course was outstanding - particularly liked the spelt bread and the pre dessert .    Only minor recommendation is there were some slight service delays part way through the meal    Mr Goossens very professionally spoke to each table briefly to thank them for coming .    Contrasting this wonderful experience to our highly disappointing and dissatisfying dinner the following day at Hertog Jan, in our opinion Hof Van Cleve is highly worthy of its three Michelin stars and the best restaurant in Belgium"

La Vague d'Or,50,Exquisite Meal,"For my last night in St Tropez, I made reservations through the Cheval Blanc, where I was staying to make dinner reservations.  Dinner service began casually outside in the patio where guests were invited to enjoy a handful of amuse bouches while sipping on cocktails and wine. At this point, the staff introduced themselves and discussed the menu for the evening. The menu is pretty much comprised of a pre fixe which starts at about 435 euros per person. You can add on a cheese selection and wine for an additional cost.  1 opted for the pre fixe menu and was invited inside to enjoy the rest of the meal in the main dining room, which was very elegant and thoughtfully appointed. Seated by the window, it was nice being able to see the flickering candles outside cast against the bright moon above.  From beginning to end, the meal was impeccable. With warm friendly service, elegant environs and great company, the time passed quickly. Well worth the hefty price tag and well deserved Three Michelin Stars.  Thank you for making my birthday celebration special.  Merci beaucoup!!!"

La Vague d'Or,50,Amazing restaurant to try once in your life,"Amazing restaurant that I personally consider one of the best in the world. Everything is perfect, from the settings, close to the sea, to the service, the food and the expensive but reasonable prices that you can expect from such a place. The wine list is stunning.  You have practically two menus as an option, a short one and a long one. Both fantastic, completely created by the three Michelin Stars Chef. Each dish is sublime.  We will return at the end of August as we managed to get a reservation, very difficult to get.."

La Vague d'Or,50,Unbelievable dinner and sunset experience! Top Notch restaurant -very romantique.,I still can't forget tomato gazpacho -the best I have ever tried in my whole life! Superb presentation - Chef is a genius! Views are stunning! Music is soft and romantic! The whole place and the hotel itself rocks! A must to reserve a table for dinner or stay in the hotel - worth every penny for unforgettable experience!

La Vague d'Or,50,Genius Chef,The best of the best! The chef is pure genius. Just go there and follow the flow. They will understand what you prefer and Taylor made a menu for you. Quality of products is unbelievable. Absolutely the best restaurant of the French Riviera and one of the best of France!

La Vague d'Or,50,Three Nights of Bliss,"Dining here is so special, we are glad we chose it for all three nights of our Cheval Blanc stay. The open courtyard under the pine trees is dreamily romantic and the warm, evening breezes are perfect for lingering. La Vague D’Or’s staff are outstanding and professional. Trim and meticulously but casually attired, they deftly navigated the tables, presenting one fabulous course after another. Throughout the evening, every member of the team was personable and cheerful. It was like dining amongst friends. They are indeed a marvelous source for joy. And of course, the food! Incredibly delicious and intensely flavored, not a single course demonstrated a fault. We savored everything we ate. I’d note as well the wonderful wine list with many reasonably priced offerings. A Leflaive PM Les Pucelles ’16 was a perfect accompaniment to the night’s seafood dishes. Another night, we had a Thibault Liger-Belair Richebourg that was amazing (a difficult wine to procure in the US as well!). Wednesday nights are ""Riviera Nights"" and though things are a bit more casual, the food quality was still exceptional. Grilled Lobster and many other courses are savored while a mellifluous vocalist and her accompanying band filled the air with French and American melodies. A very enjoyable three nights of dining that linger on as pleasant memories."

La Vague d'Or,50,High gastronomy,"We enjoyed our dinner, in particular the tomato preparations and the wine pairings (though everything was good). The sunset view is also lovely, as is the attentive service. We found ourselves very, very satisified (read: full!) at the end of the meal :)"

La Vague d'Or,50,"Food, service, atmosphere perfects","As usual, everything was perfect. We made a reservation a few months before and we finally it happened. The view is stunning, as the service and the food. We opted for the menus with five courses as we know that this is a lot to taste and appreciate. Each course is subject to a presentation made by the waitress detailing the ingredients which compose them. A real pleasure for the ears first and the palate after.  We will be back, of course."

La Vague d'Or,50,Perfection all around,"This was the best meal and dining experience we have ever had. The attention to detail is impeccable. The service is on point, truly the best service we have ever encountered. Every bite of food has so much flavor. The atmosphere and views makes the meal even more special. Worth every penny. If you have the opportunity to dine here, do yourself a favor and make a reservation."

La Vague d'Or,50,Experience with Story,"People have to resurrect old dining experiences since travel has ended for now. So it has been a while since this dinner at La Vague and it was frankly the third time visiting. For such a fancy restaurant, the experience is the very least pretentious of most places held in high regard by the dining community. The food is exquisite and the wine selection is impeccable. The location is the best and the presentation worth the experience. There is no but to this other than but for folks like my wife and I and the friends we bring along the 'but' is thanks for making it fun AND good dining. The point has a story about the cheese. We saved our appetite for an entire day, knowing we would experience multi-course quantity. Ravaged with hunger we ordered the cheese first!! We did have a couple very nice bottles of wine so at the end as the last course, with no people in the restaurant the Maitre'd explained that the chef wanted to speak to us. Fearful we were too loud Americans but wanting to meet the famous chef we agreed thinking he might ask us not to join again. Alas, it wasn't to be any more than a firm explanation that no matter what, cheese is never eaten first. Voila! a story none of us will ever forget and that we repeat with joy. Thanks for that experience and with any luck it would be most pleasurable to lift the veil of travel and visit again. ""You do not eat cheese first""."

La Vague d'Or,50,"Food, service, atmosphere perfects","We took the 5 course menus and a white hermitage as a wine for the whole dinner, it was perfect. The service was as usual very good and the food from start to finish excellent. We enjoy every step of the meal and it was difficult for us to eat everything as we have small appetites, but we left nothing in our plates.  We will return next year as every year."

La Vague d'Or,50,Fabulous food in an even better environment,Fabulous food in an even better environment. Staff were very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.

La Vague d'Or,50,Birthday Dinner,"Hands down the best Michelin Restaurant I have ever been to. Dining alfresco under the moon with sultry lights and the view of the water from Saint Tropez was straight out of a movie. Romantic, delicious, and the service was impeccable."

La Vague d'Or,50,a perfect storm,"We were a bit skeptical about eating here.....3*, what to expect. We have quite some experience with Michelin star restaurants and are not easily blown away. Well, Vage D'Or made it all happen. From the suave feeling you get immediately upon entering, the flawless service with a smile and genuine concern about your enjoyment and then all these amazing dishes and wines......Nope, not cheap but worth every euro. Mercia beaucoup, a night we will always remember with fondness....."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,40,Mixed feelings!,"This was a real mixed bag evening. We booked a few weeks in advance and then could not book accommodation in the village or venue close. We eventually had to stay almost 20 kms away and fork out €250 for taxis which meant the evening broke the €1000 barrier with ease. Lovely restaurant. Although it is remote, it’s was clear immediately that many of the diners were French and regulars. I hope I haven’t got this wrong but we did feel that the ‘regulars’ who spoke French were being prioritised and given a different level of service. My French is not good but most of the staff who attended our table did not speak English. Not their fault but perhaps that was why we didn’t really feel … welcomed. The food… top notch. Many highlights and if anything we found some to be overly excessive and rich. I had to reach for the gaviscon later at night! Would we return? Yes if we could stay close by and I would brush up on may French before!"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,The best restaurant in the world!!!,"Amazing family lunch!!!! Perfect service, local creative and perfect meals and great wines! The best restaurant in the world!! Everything was perfect and full of surprises! I will not hesitate to come as soon as I have the opportunity!!!"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Theatre and alchemy - perfection,"It's a great experience to eat at the Auberge, lovely atmosphere. The staff are lovely, put you at ease, and quite a few speak English.    We were very pleased to meet Gilles Goujon who came to talk to us before the meal. Charming man.    There was no a la carte menu, we had a choice of two set ones with five or six courses . But when I booked they asked if there were things we don't or can't eat, so the menu was adapted for us. We ate at a nice pace and four hours flew past.    We loved the oyster with its 'pearl' and the razor clam 'sandwich', plus the other fish dishes and the drama of how they were all served.    The cheese 'chariot' is huge, over six feet long and multi-layered and it takes two people to bring it to your table. Part of their philosophy is to buy local, so a lot of the cheeses were from the Aude department and nothing was from outside Occitanie.    Superb lunch, we hope to be back soon,"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,third visit,"as we had the chance to return to fontjoncouse on our gourmettour through france we could not resist. we stayed at a room next to outdoor pool where we relaxed with some other guests. dinner was very nice as usual and service was attentive and friendly. the girls loved their meals, too."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,The best ever,The perfect choice for a special occasion. This is the best restaurant I've ever tried. Reasonable prices on menu. Oyster was delicious. We will definitely go on our next visit to city..

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,a world of happyness,"a world of happyness , august 15th 2020, another diner at Fonjoncousse : thanks Chef Gilles Goujon, it is total happyness to eat at Auberge du vieux puit, remember july 12th 2020 : i wrote that for me it was the world best, and in august 2020 all world travellers say in Tripadvisor : Gilles Goujon is the world number 1 , i am so happy for all the restaurant team, they do a fantastic job, the food quality is TOP, the team is TOP, go to the Corbières Mountains it is TOP, i wish after the COVID, all world people can to visit France and have diner at Fontjoncousse, you have to do once time in your life ... in this very difficult world , Fontjoncousse restaurant is a world of happyness"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Remarquable technicity,"Went there for a dinner and the nearly mandatory night (considering how secluded the place is)  The hotel is clearly underwhelming : nothing is bad, but the level is much lower than the one of the restaurant that one feels disappointed. And he probably needs to be refreshed  Anyway lets focus on the meal  First. the ""theater"" part is amazing. Excellent service (apart maybe from the wine, see lower). Remarkable presentation of many dishes (for instance the translucent sphere with smoke inside accompanying the oyster in the first starter was mind boggling)  And some nice ""+"" like the ceiling lights that fully illuminate the plate and come on and off by some ""secret"" feature  I was a bit disappointed by the wine list (very expensive) and pairing (some interesting local wines but overall a bit underwhelming, with a couple of mistakes by the waitress - though the sommelier was very good)  The sphere previously described, the ""fake"" couteau shelfish, the ""fake"" lemon...all are the proof of the level of technicity reached by the chef  So a great experience...personally I prefer a slightly less technical form of cuisine with the focus given to the ingredient (Bras, Veyrat...)...but Chef Goujon clearly deserves his 3* (and what an incredible life story!)"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,40,"Superb food, but some reservations","Although I have given 4 stars fro this review if I were considering the food only I would have given if 5.    This the the third time that my wife and I have visited Chef Goujon over the past five years and on this occasion, as on each of the past, the food has been breathtakingly conceived and executed.    But, I have a few reservations. Firstly we both opted for the ""Air de fêtes en Corbières"" menu, which offers numerous amuse bouches and small plates. I also chose the matching wine offering. This type of offering must be delivered at a consistent pace over the evening, and it was not. There were long gaps between the earlier fish courses and then, towards the end, we were presented with a meat course, cheeses and desert in quick succession.    My second reservation relates to the quality of the accommodation. Because the restaurant is in a remote location most diners will chose to stay overnight. The rooms are large and clean, and the bed linen is of top quality, but the rooms are starting to look tired and some of the cheaper furniture is starting to look very dated. This takes somewhat from the overall experience and a revamping of the bedrooms is needed. In addition the quality of the WiFi is simply dreadful.    Finally, in 2019 it is no longer acceptable to give a priced menu to a man and an unpriced menu to the woman accompanying him. This kind of sexist nonsense might have been thought charming at one time, but that time has long since passed."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,40,Great theatre .......,"We have been lucky enough to sample other three star Michelin restaurants. The expectations are clearly going to be high especially when Fontjoncouse requires a three hour drive and staying over. At the prices charged, the dining needs to be a flawless experience.    No question the ambience of the restaurant and the theatre of the food presentation was excellent. The tricky ceiling lights that fully illuminate the plate and come on and off by some secret feature was terrific. The ambience is lovely but don't expect tablecloths to go with the fine stemmed wine glasses.    The amuse bouche starter and oyster entree and the truffled egg were certainly delightful. The fish with a ministrone broth served with red wine was really mixed in flavours and confusing on the palate. The veal with a tower biscuit of mushroom and side salad was certainly tasty but was served with a bizzarre sweet white wine and the side salad was heavily accentuated with horseradish so powerful that I personally was unable to eat. The dessert looked amazing but on first encounter with a spoon became a runny mess on the plate. The cheese chariot was certainly huge, but was missing all our favorite cheeses.    We opted for the most expensive wine per course option at 95 euro per person but the wines provided were unremarkable. The wine waiter wasn't up to speed and for all the courses past entrees, the food was served before he served the wine This isn't acceptable for the prices being charged.    600 euro for two.    The theatre was great, the entrees excellent but overall it wasn't a wow experience that we will talk about for years to come as we have done with other Michelin star experiences."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,exceptional dining destination,"Somewhat out of the way location in a beautiful wine region lies a wonderful, probably somewhat underappreciated gem of a 3* michelin restuarant. Flawless, friendly, service, exceptional menu. The wine pairing was wonderful for getting to know some of the local producers (unfortunatly we didn't have time to explore/wine tour region ourselves longer). Highly recommended."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Utterly amazing,The decor is interesting and comfortable with beautiful lighting .As soon as you enter the premises the staff go to great lengths to ensure that your time in their restaurant is perfect .The menu offers good a variety of choices for all tastes including vegetarians .I had the vegetarian tasting menu and it was totally amazing food .From the canapés to the petit fours at the end of the meal everything was utterly exquisite .The food and service were perfect .The food was imaginative and I found it faultless .Each course made me smile and was a total delight .I would love to return to this restaurant.

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Safe at the Plate...,"The Auberge is a three-star Michelin choice, and it deserves to be. Everything is perfect. The room is functional and spotless; the service is attentive and the chef is without error. Even the little gift shop at the entryway has its moments. They almost remember your prior visits, and they don't disrespect you in the seating plan.  More importantly, they don't wallow in anniversary menus. The food is up to date, and functionally modern. Slightly difficult to reach, but worth the effort. Most serious complaint: Nothing that I wanted to eat on the menu. No stretch at all. Nothing offered  which takes an effort for the kitchen or for the intellect of the diner. Nothing to interfere with perfection."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Wow,"Ignore the few reviews less than “Excellent.” This is a true 3-star (maybe should be 4 if it were available) experience. Ignore the price. Pray that they’re still serving the “dirty egg” dish - you have to like truffles - a LOT. Get the flight of local wines to go with it, and you’ll be all set."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Fabulous,"I cannot find any word to express the surprise. Incredible meal and taste, amazing dishes and tastes. Thanks you for this good moment. We will definitely come back."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Spectacular find in the middle of nowhere!!!,"First visit with family of 4 each originating from different parts of the world, Australia, Ireland, Malaysia and US - food was out of this world - we went for the surprise menu, although allergies were checked - one of us couldn't eat something and our Head Waiter replaced the meal with a superb meal. Superb food from local regions and service was excellent. We were so satisfied, full and content with our whole experience. Hopefully we can return next year and taste something different!! Well done Monsieur Goujon and your Crew!!"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,If Michelin had more than 3 Stars Gilles Goujon would be covered with them!,"This place is truly a dream. Chef simply asked about any food allergies and then proceeded to carry us away. From the basics of decoration and tables to lighting, the experience is complete. From all local ingredients he conjours up aromas, textures and flavors you've never experienced. The house signature is the ""rotten egg"". Not to be missed. The local sea fare is also a must. The cheese cart at the end is as big as a car. It's no wonder Michelin gives them their 3 Star rating. His creativity, his staff his deep array of offerings is the stuff of legend. WOW!"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Sublime and then some....,"An absolutely fantastic experience from start to finish. We had the chef's choice tasting menu, 7 amazing courses, plus amuse bouche and chocolates at either end. The flavour combinations were incredible and we all agreed that every single dish was perfection. We asked the sommelier to choose local wines by the glass to accompany each course and were amazed at the (relatively) low price of choosing to taste wines in this way. The wine pairings went really well with the individual courses and all were from the immediate area. We chose not to stay in the auberge, but found a very good B&B within walking distance."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Special Place,"The Auberge is truly an excellent dining establishment. Expensive yes, but as one of the only 28 three star Michelin restaurants in France this was expected. Some of the dishes like the famous ""dirty eggs"" are creations by maestro Giles truly not to be believed. Wonderful things are done with the goat and beef dishes, and the fish courses. A cheese board longer than the Queen Mary, filled with an extraordinary selection of chevres, and sheep as well as cow. The biggest selection we have ever seen. Marvelous desserts, like the lemon and orange. The service is just spectacular.    Yet the new, fashionable decor and lighting are not to everyone's taste, and the stone underground well ( the ""puit"" in the restaurant's title) in the lounge sadly cannot be seen properly because of the glare from the lighting fixtures above. We overheard someone say that there is something preferable about having a tablecloth on the tables when one is about to consume a $300 per person, four hour long and many course meal. We only wish. But there is something nice about the new, more casual attire most people are sporting nowadays. No more ties and jackets for men here in deep Southwest, rural France.    The hotel is fine as far as the few rooms go, at fair prices, congregated around the pool. and it is convenient, indeed mandatory, to stay there because one would have to be an utter fool to leave the restaurant late at night and attempt to drive anywhere on those hilly and curvy, narrow roads that lead away from this little village of 60 inhabitants.    There is something however to comment on about the wines. A wonderful selection, yes, as has been written about by others, but the markup is just an outrage. With all the many hundreds, indeed thousands, of small, excellent vineyards in the surrounding SW Rousillan countryside and in other parts of France from where the wines come, which produce a plethora of reasonably priced, lovely wines for the retail trade, it is hard to find a wine on the wine list under a hundred euros a bottle. And there are only a sprinkling of those, and also just a few half bottles and glasses to order from on the list. We were surprised, to say the least, to learn that a local, modest but nice wine from the same village that sells for 15 euros at the winery was 90 euros on the Auberge list. 6X markup is just wrong. I grew up thinking 2X and 3X retail were the norm in France, even at the top restaurants, to encourage the sale and movement of the cellar. I am sure there are many other examples like that 6X on the list. We are all for capitalism but there are limits. Yet two and three star chef/owners throughout France mostly do the same thing, probably comparing each others wine list prices periodically to remain in step. Like the stock market - buy cheap and sell high seems to be the rule. This is just not right for lovers of fine food and needs to be spoken about. Pleasant, satisfying thoughts about truly great meals by world class chefs even at stratospheric prices should not be compromised by a feeling of wine price gouging.    Having said this, human sheep that we are, we would probably return and happily recommend this to other readers, hopefully after the wine prices get adjusted downwards so that the entire dining experience can be more readily enjoyed, both during and after."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Annual visit,"Usual visit on our trip to France. Great food, wonderfil staff, good wine. Never disappoints. Marvellous atmosphere"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,"""The ultimate culinary experience""","Yes it's expensive but worth every penny! The service , food and total ambiance is outstanding . The whole meal took over 4 hours it was pure theatre !  Forget the people who moan on some of these reports they need to carry on eating at McDonald's !  It's all part of the package .  We had the chefs choice taster menu and wine package worth every penny.  If this is your hobby and you love food don't hesitate and visit .  We will return soon absolute heaven  Thanks"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Great place,"Wow, that was an experience. It was quite the drive to get there (!) but what a place! Very professional, and each course was such a culinary experience. Well worth the wait, and the drive, and the cost. Fun."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Amazing,"We came back after 6 years and once again, we was amazed about the food. We had the Big menu with the Wine menu. It was perfect.  The chef went to all tables and had a short chat with all guests. The service is prof. but relaxed. We like that.  We stayed over in the most relaxed and nice room with private terrasse and pool access very close. Its a very smal hotel.  We choose the breakfast in the pool house. But saw that several of the other guests had a wonderful roomservice at the private terrasse. We might take that next time."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Pelgrimage to culinary heaven,"The joy that came with the anticipation to have lunch here bode well. 3 stars are worth a journey and indeed that is absolutely true with restaurant le vieux puits. The building and its premises are far from spectacular. Tucked away in the centre of Fontjoncouse we were welcomed to have a drink on the terrace wich is adjacent to the parking lot. The wine list is impressive but - oops - orangina and coke zero are not in the house. The dining room is large and the seating is great. The knife for the main dish sticks in the table (never saw that before). We took the lunch option and were positively surprised! Highlights? The glucose balloon filled with smoke that accompanied the oyster, the nice eadible box that contained prepared vegetables, the apple mesh that came with the mains.....  The service is - apart from a coffee spoon falling and a mussel shell dropping off the plate when picking it up - impecabble as you might expect from this type of restaurant."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,"Stunning food, attentive staff in a superb ambiance","Restaurants don't get and keep 3 Michelin stars for nothing. The overall experience was incredible with amazing food, attention to the smallest detail and a wonderful place to dine out. This is an experience of epic proportions - more than a meal - more than food. It is expensive but the overall cost has to be weighed against the superb level of service, the exquisite attention to the smallest detail and the high quality of the food. If you afford it go at least once - It is worth a very long trip. Fortunately I live quite close.  They also added a candle for a birthday..."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,A Truly Spectacular French Restaurant,"It is hard to describe how insanely great this restaurant is. It sits at the intersection of superb French Cooking and innovation across the appetisers, Mains, bread and desserts. This is simply one of the best restaurants in the world."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Stunning and unforgettable!,"Our first time in a 3-star Michelin restaurant. On the way to the restaurant, our expectations made us afraid to be disappointed. It didn't happen. If perfection exists, this is a place where you get very close to it. Everything from the welcoming to the ending with coffee and Armagnac (both on the charming terrasse) was more than enjoyable. The service is impeccable, but the staff is relaxed, genuinely courteous and with the sense of humor. The great young sommelier Sylvain (Syl-vin :-)) recommended two fantastic wines from the region, very reasonably priced. We took the main menu dégustation. All dishes, including the amuse-bouche, are based on the combination of few ingredients, whose savors are brought to their highest expression. Simplicity and complexity were never so close on a table. The oyster enveloped in a ""gelée d'eau de mer"", perfumed with oak-tree smoke; the caramelized zucchini flower with lobster sorbet and carpaccio; the incredible ""rotten egg"" with mushrooms and generous amounts of truffle; the fish soup with red snapper; the 80-days matured beef with its unbelievable garnishes; and finally, great cheeses selected from a huge plateau and the dessert, the ""real fake lemon"". Highly recommended if you want to share a unique and unforgettable culinary experience."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Luxurious theatre,"We have been luck enough to have eaten here several times over the years, and the standard is always unbelievable. To have retained three Michelin stars for 8 years speaks volumes for the chef and staff. Although a sophisticated establishment, service is not at all stuffy. On arrival we were shown straight to our table. The maitre d' recognised us from our last visit over four years previously so we were impressed. The restaurant has had a complete makeover since our last visit and is now more modern and ""clean"". They even have overhead lights that come on to illuminate your plate when you are served your next dish! The whole experience is theatre, but that would mean nothing if the food was terrible. However, it is absolutely stunning. From the appetizers to the petit fours it was all faultless. Before the meal the chef Gilles Goujon visited each table to say hello and exchange a few pleasantries and he also came out at the end of the meal to check everything was OK. The truffle egg was as delicious as always, the complexity of the flavour in the sauce with the fish was unbelievable, the depth of flavour of the sauce with the kid was again outstanding, and finally the ""false cherry"" dessert, not forgetting of course the huge selection of cheeses. Yes it's expensive, service is not fast, but it is an experience rather than a meal out."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,utter bliss - it doesn't get any better,Our third visit for three nights and Giles Goujon produces food of the Gods. From ameuse geules to petite fours taste and presentations are sublime. Every course was sensational in every way and beautifully balanced. How does he do it? Perfection artistic and utterly devine each and every meal with a tome of wines to chose from. Claudio the Maitre' D was truly wonderful - knowledgeable with a marvellous personality and lots of experience shone - all the staff were very professional charming and helpful. I would give this amazing restaurant 4 Michelin Stars if I could!

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,one of the best tables in the world,"everything is outstanding at l'Auberge du Vieux Puits. The food is always surprising, the wines are excellent including some excellent regional unexpensive bottles. Cheese is home-aged and deserves some stars by itself. On top of this - which is becoming an exception for Michelin 3-stars - the chef (Guy Goujeon) is cooking and welcomes you from the aperitif to the dessert, willing to share and explain! A really great place!"

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Absolutely stunningly outrageous in every respect (only if you like food!),"Everyone should experience this at least once in their lifetime.  Outrageous quality and presentation of the grub. Clever, unusual and extraordinary.  Outrageously delivered perfect service - with added humour.  Outrageous wine list - encyclopaedic !  Outrageously expensive .    BUT if one considers the efforts of the chef and all supporting staff in delivering an amazing eating and drinking experience, it is worth it.  I could go on , you just have to go and see for yourselves. reservations are imperative."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Superb.,"The truffled egg is amazing, worth a journey. We had lunch and dinner. All dishes were superb and the service was very polished."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Very sophisticated and original,"This was an amazing meal. There were four of us and some ordered a la carte and others took the 'prix fix' menu. Each dish was highly refined with very subtle taste. The truffled egg was amazing. Somehow they manage to talk the yolk out of a hard boiled egg and replace it with an extremely tasty truffle sauce. Amazing. The 'cuddlefish' was terrific. If you love high end food, this is your place. Priced accordingly...;)."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,"Wow,Wow WOW !",Yes its pricey but what an amazing meal.  We chose the menu garriques ( ?) consisting of 6 or 7 small perfectly cooked dishes including courses containing lobster sorbet and goats cheese ice cream . Beautiful fish and meat dishes and the cheeses are to die for. The sommelier chose an excellent local wine at a reasonable price .  Staff here are so professional yet warm and friendly.  When you go watch out for the lights above each diner.  Separate gluten free dishes when requested .  Probably one of the best meals I've ever had

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Amazing dinner. 5* rating for a 3* restaurant,"This was an exceptional experience. Service on highest level and still creating a relaxed atmosphere. And the food a surprise from course to course. Certainly, worthwhile a trip."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Simply amazing ! An exceptional food experience ...,"My husband booked us lunch as a surprise and it was a totally amazing experience, The food, setting and the staff are all exceptional .. this is molecular gastronomy with a smile and a sense of humor & fun. Simply sit back and enjoy a beautiful experience."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,The Epitome of a Three Star Restaurant,"This is the epitome of what a 3 star restaurant should be. The food is divine, the wait staff both efficient and charming and the dining room is both comfortable and a visual delight. There are no pretensions here...just superb food.  We went for lunch and it was well worth the trek to this remote part of the Corbieres region. We would (and will) go back in a heartbeat."

Auberge Du Vieux Puits,50,Fabulous! Exceeded expectations,"Our visit was a ""significant birthday"" treat...we try to eat in Michelin star restaurants whenever we can, but always the lunch or early-bird, as frankly, we're not super-wealthy. On this occasion we pushed the boat out and went for the full experience, including matching wines! We went for the menu which contains the restaurant's signature dishes...I'm not going to describe each dish as I don't want to spoil the surprises, but they were divine and also great fun! It was a succession of sensory delights from the canapes on the terrace to the final mouthful. The staff were of the calibre rarely found - extremely professional with the ability to add to the sense of delight created by the experience.    We stayed in the Auberge and that was a quality experience in itself. Lovely basket of fruit and treats on arrival, gorgeous room, beautiful terrace from which we could ramble to and from the pool (with beautiful surrounds and beds). I was blissed out before we even went down to dinner!    We loved the whole experience and will always remember it - so glad we went and really hope to return."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,A tasting experience of a lifetime,The food never ends and neither does the imaginative ways of presentation. We were visiting the town for the annual festival des champignons (mushroom festival) which is worth the considerable detour to find this cold little town.

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Brilliant experience,"Fabulous dinner; one of the best 3 star michelin restaurants we've been to, if not the best. Other reviews have said it all. No hesitation in recommending this wonderful dining experience."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Best food and restaurant ever,We have just spent the most delightful evening at this exceptional restaurant in St Bonnet Le Froid! The ambience with glorious throne like wooden chairs and exquisite views started the evening on a high in this beautiful place! It is impossible to find expressive vocabulary...More

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,"Beautiful View, Delicious Food!",Our experience at this restaurant was wonderful. We selected the middle menu with about six different courses. Each course was a surprise for the eye and mouth. We were not disappointed. My husband mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary upon our arrival in casual...More

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,As wonderful as ever,"It does not get any better than this. The restaurant sets superb standards for food, service and comfort. We hope to visit this restaurant on every visit to the village of St Bonnet."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,This restaurant will leave you Speechless!,"The best meal I've ever had. This is far more than food, it's pure passion. Was lucky enough to visit during mushroom picking season. Choose the ""menu dégustation"" (taster menu), you will be spoiled for life."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,110%,Simply put this is one of those rare finds. They set a standard few can understand let alone attain.

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Fantastic diner and stay at hotel,"We had been looking forward to trying Régis & Jaques Marcon based upon recommendations from friends and guides, and ... it did not disappoint.  The restaurant offers a very balanced and innovative menu with a strong focus on seasonal mushrooms. We were lucky enough to be in the morels season... up to the dessert!  Service was perfect from beginning to end, and the sommelier was helpful when we hesitated between two wines.  A very nice feature was the possibility to have a good vintage champagne by the cup, you don't see that everywhere.  Finally, the rooms are fantastic: in troglodyte fashion, one floor below the restaurant with a long distance view on countryside and hills.  Will definitely go back."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Great experience,"Dinner with 6 friends.  We took the ""Entre Velay et Vivarais"" menu (6 courses) which was fantastic.    Great food and experience and obviously less expensive than a 3* restaurant in Paris.  In addition, we had the chance to see the kitchen and this was really impressive and amazing.    In two words: Loved it!"

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Unforgettable 25th Birthday!," Words cannot suffice to describe the experience we witnessed and partook in. First of all, a special mention to the staff. The level of professionalism was impeccable. Five or six members of staff were designated to take care of us. Every one of them made us feel welcomed; smiling and chit chatting with us throughout the meal. It was thoroughly appreciated.    The food was quite simply the best I had ever had. Absolute perfection. The restaurant deserves its three Michelin Stars. It without a doubt exceeded the likes of the Ambassadeurs or Epicure. Add to that the extremely reasonable prices, compared to restaurants of the same calibre and same ranking.     The creativity and preparation behind each dish were both astonishing. Chef Marcon plays a lot on sweet/savoury and different textures. He uses both conventional and controversial ingredients. For example, he takes green beans and turns them into something exceptional. He uses savoury ingredients, such as mushrooms or lentils, as part of a dessert. We enjoyed the lentils caviar in a Verveine liqueur and the mushroom chocolates.    You feel the love and dedication put in the dishes. The food looks appetising, because it is so well put together on the plates. Most dishes are decorated with local edible flowers and herbs.     Our party of four chose the ""Vellave Menu"" which is an entrée, a main dish, a cheese platter and multiple desserts. Three of us went for the Foie gras with mushrooms and wild berries entrée. The fourth person took the crab cannelloni with a lentil ratatouille. For our main dish, my fiancé and I chose the duck and his parents took the red snapper. I can only speak for myself when I say the duck was the best I have ever had. It was served in two different ways. The first one was cooked in the oven with an apricot jam served on a bed of finely chopped green beans and mushrooms. The second one was shredded duck with a creamy polenta on the top. It was beautiful.     The ""in between bites"" or entremets as the French calls them, were both refreshing and surprising. They eased the transition to the next dish.      I appreciated the fact we weren't offered bread too often. Simply because we didn't need any bread with the served dishes and because bread usually kills the appetite.     The restaurant is a very well oiled machinery. There were no dead beats between each dish. We had a well deserved break between the end of the savoury and the start of the sweet dishes. It allowed us to discuss what we had just eaten and what we had preferred. The water or wine is poured without you even realising.      My fiancé had mentioned, when making the reservation months ago that it would be my 25th birthday on the day. I honestly didn't expect anything, being more than thrilled with the brilliant experience. But at the end of our meal, they came out with a cake for me with a lit candle. How very thoughtful of them. The cake (a vanilla panacotta filled with a strawberry mousse on a genoise base) came from their own Patisserie and Boulangerie, Les Chanterelles. It is located in the village of Saint-Bonnet-le-Froid.      We felt stuffed but not heavy when we left. The digestion was easy, sign that the ingredients and cooking techniques used were top notch.     Le Chef Régis Marcon came to greet his guests at the start and end of their meal.     The restaurant was to its full capacity. According to the staff it is customary for them to be full at lunch and dinner time. Not surprising. They offer great deals such as dinner meal + night stay + breakfast for.      I can only wish you a similar experience to ours. This is a restaurant everyone should try once in their life. Word of advise: don't look at the pictures if you're hungry or you will be left salivating! "

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,perfection,"It's not the first time , we had the occasion to stay there It's with no doubt one one the best restaurant in France and the 3 stars Michelin is certainly not stolen What to say when you reach such a perfection , ( Please note cooking is my hobby, and I am not an easy customer) From the beginning to the end , it's a great pleasure fot the eyes and taste  Sole critic ; With the option "" great menu"" wine included, let us say the selected wines are good, but it could be much better And consequently I think it's better to choose the wine card particularly if you are only two  Anyhow , GO GO  Jacques duparque"

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,A unique experience in what is perhaps one of the best restaurants in France,"Now this was an exceptional treat! I was invited to the Marcon restaurant for my 30th birthday by my other half, and I am still dreaming of it! I will do my best to be objective in this review though.    One of the best ways to put the customer in the mood for good local food is to make them travel in the middle of Haute-Loire and invite them in a very new looking building which blends in perfectly with the village and the surrounding fields. Once we were sat at our table, in wooden seats that were the size of thrones (not kidding), we were offered the menu with a quick explanation of the venue and what the restaurant values were. We already knew that we wanted to go for the 'taster/discovery' menu and the lead waiter spent five minutes discussing our potential allergies. He was able to offer an alternative to one of the dishes to my partner who had an intolerance to one of the ingredients (we suggest that you warn the restaurant in advance though).    Without going into to many details, the dinner started with a plethora of 'amuse-bouche'. They were really there to initiate your palate to beautiful and strange flavours. The menu had six courses (plus cheese and dessert) and for each of them, we were served the most refined produce and meats/fish in an exquisite presentation. We could not pick a favourite among all these dishes which made you explore the local flavours of the flora, herbs and mushrooms. The dessert menu was quite long and it was difficult to chose, but the complementary petits-fours were welcome to expand the different tones of sweetness! It took us just under four hours to get through every dish, and we were not rushed at all.    The actual restaurant room was quite oblong which was open to the beauty of the surrounding fields, forests and hills thanks to a huge bay window. The view was breathtaking. The lighting, decoration and table ornaments all had a theme of nature, forest and mushrooms. The service was impeccable, although it is worth noting that it may take the novice some getting used to all the attention given. The tables were also nicely spread out in the room which gave a nice sensation of space.    The only couple of downsides were the lack of clear indications to get to the restaurant once you arrive in the village, and when we entered the restaurant the welcome from the front desk staff was a bit cold (we've experienced better in a local pub). Finally, one of the wines we were served was not great, but that may be perhaps because we were picky. In any case, I don't think that I will ever forget this birthday present!"

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Top in class,"A week-end there with my wife. I would go back every week-end if i could. This place is where ""mérite le voyage"" makes perfect sense. Amazingly good."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Impeccable dining experience,"We go twice a year to Regis & Jacques Marcon and from all the top French restaurants we have visited this is standing out by far for the fantastic setting, extremely creative food (that changes according to the season and every year-on-year), one of the best service in Europe and a fantastic wine list. I see it well-ahead of other places in the west such as Pic, G. Blanc or Chabran. We usually stay in the hotel ""les Clos des Cimes"" where the hotel is organizing a babysitter for our two kids and a limousine service to the restaurant which is 5 minutes away. This time the spring menu (go for the big one!) was starting with a great lobster, followed by fois gras and the most outstanding combination of asparagus and morels. Main cause was a great ""cochon de lait"" - you then have the choice between different cheese options and desserts - go for the mushrooms with banana - this is the most amazing taste possible. The wine list is extensive and offers good options with reasonable prices for such a restaurant. The sommelier is helpful and adapts to you. We have already book the table in October and look forward to the next experience!"

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Outstanding ...,"One hears great reviews of this 'mecca to food'. We booked our stay & our meal & hoped that we would not be disappointed. We were not ! Our aperitifs were served with a selection of very tasty canapés.    My lobster with risotto, & lobster claws in a bouillon were delightful. The saddle of lamb has been cooked in a bread crust which enclosed the herbs. The crust and herbs were removed at the table & the lamb tender & very tasty.    This meal was pure art, theatre & a great experience. Our waiter made the experience even better by being very relaxed. We stayed overnight & even had room for a delicious breakfast."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Excellent! We loved it!,"Very very nice restaurant - amazing location, we recommend that you book a table next to the window to appreciate the view of the mountains (if you go there at lunch time especially). This time we went there for lunch (we've been there once before for dinner.. ) - staff is very nice and helpfull, explaining each dishes carefully. Unbelievable food, very pretty to see and delicious to eat. Haute cuisine at it is best ! - Regis Marcon the chef came to the room and spoke to the guests - he was very nice and friendly.  Yes - it is expensive but it is an experience for all your senses! Highly recommended as a special treat... a special moment to share. We are looking forward to go back!"

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,Mostly sublime,"Beautiful setting with plate glass windows affording great views of the pine forests as the sun sets. The menu is inventive and based on ingredients of the local area, including flowers, mushrooms and more. Great to see Regis doing a tour of the restaurant to welcome guests at the beginning of the evening and to say goodbye at the end. The food was copious and, in general, perfectly executed. The only let down was the Zander with Bulgur and Mussels which was surprisingly bland. Everything else was beautifully presented and flavourful. Service is what you'd expect at a 3* restaurant -formal but friendly."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,The best,"In do not have the words to express what a great experience dining at this restaurant is. The food, the wine, and the surroundings are exceptional. The service is impeccable, but is welcoming and very human. This restaurant captures the spirit of surrouding countryside."

Hotel Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon,50,This is what 3 Michelin stars is about,"When you reserve a table here, it is in the confident expectation of an outstanding gastronomic experience. Since you already know this, I won't waste space trying to critique the cuisine.  The restaurant is a five minute drive from the village. If you're staying at the Clos des Cimes (the Marcons' village-centre hotel), the drive is part of the service..  On arrival, we were whisked straight to our table. The dining room is long and divided by screens so that you can only see two or three other tables and can hear none of them.  You will be offered champagne as an aperitif. Resist; instead, try a glass of Condrieu, a delightful white from the North Rhone, made from viognier grapes. We actually continued with this through the first of the entrees.  There are two fixed-price menus. For 165€ you get more courses than you can count. We went for the 135€ Velay menu which offers two entrees, a choice of main course, then cheese, or desert. There is an option to skip one of the entrees for 20€ less and this, in hindsight, would have been a good idea because we could hardly cope with the endless stream of incredible tiny taster dishes that puntuated what we had ordered.  The wine list is enormous but not daunting, since it includes many excellent bottles at reasonable prices as well as a large selection of half-bottles.  The service is like a well-oiled machine, helpful and friendly without being familiar. There must have been as many waiting staff as diners and they seem instantly to slip into whatever language the table is speaking.  We arrived at 8 and at 10.45 were returned, purring, to our hotel.  The next day, we skipped breakfast."

PIC,50,3 stars Michelin and deserved,Gourmet dining par excellence with an amazing wine menu. Having such a great and in depth wine menu it would be good if the menu could be sent ahead of the visit for guests to prepare and choose some bottles ahead of the visit.

PIC,50,Beyond words,"One of a kind experience we lived at Pic last August. Not only the service was perfect, but the food was absolutely mind (and senses) blowing. Everything, from A to Z, was subtile, unexpected, incredibly well balanced and obviously, delicious. A journey we wont’ forget!"

PIC,50,Absolutely delicious,This is the second time I have dined here. And it is still fantastic. Every dish were so beautiful and delicious. I wish I live in France so that I can dine again and again.

PIC,50,Lovely birthday lunch!,"Perfect place to spend an amazing lunch for a special occasion. The food, the service, the place is without question high level. We felt welcomed and the ambiance is really peaceful and friendly and for sure professional. We would love to come back anytime!"

PIC,50,"High quality, original, and creative cuisine in a beautiful setting.",Spectacular original and creative cuisine in a beautiful setting with wonderful service. The wine pairing was extremely high quality.

PIC,50,WOW,Long awaited moment and it didn’t disappoint. Perfection in every plate; professional but warm service; creativity and tradition . Automatically in my top 3 of the best restaurants I’ve ever been

PIC,50,A meal at Maison Pic,"Everything is just perfect: from the taste, to the visual of the dishes, the service, the environment end the nice furnitures in the room."

PIC,50,Amazing experience,"We enjoyed a superb meal at Pic. Each dish seemed to surpass the previous. The service was impeccable, a perfect balance of attentive and friendly without being intrusive. I could not recommend Pic highly enough for a special celebration, a truly unique experience."

PIC,50,JUST PERFECT!,"As i have posted on my fb page, everything here is an art: the place, the food and the wine. The service was excellent, bravo to all the staff! My husband and I appreciated so much that we were invited to have a moment in their kitchen as i have already visited different top chefs' kitchens in the past. We were honored of having this experience. Nothing more to say but: Perfect! Bonne Continuation à Vous!  ARLENE ARRAGON"

PIC,50,A perfect meal,"We knew our visit to Maison Pic was going to be special even before we got there. The reservations staff took the initiative to contact us about several details, including making sure that they had my wife's name correct for her birthday celebration. Once we arrived, everyone we encountered made a special effort to ensure that we had a wonderful experience.    When we arrived for lunch, we were ushered into their beautiful garden for a glass of champagne and some amuse bouche. Each group of diners has their own private space in the garden making this a wonderful way to being the meal and get your taste buds ready for the main event. Later, we went to the dining room where the tables are nicely spaced to give each group some privacy while also creating the enjoyable environmental buzz of a room full of people enjoying delicious food.    As expected, the food was fabulous. Each dish accomplished the chef's goal of bringing out the tastes and flavors of the underlying ingredients. There was a great mix of foods so that each course created a bit of a surprise. We ordered the wine pairings which were very well selected and made the meal even better.    We stayed overnight and I must say that the rooms were wonderful. After a five-hour meal, it was so nice to be able to go for a short walk and then retire to a beautiful and very comfortable room.    I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. It is expensive, but the full experience is worth it. The combination of wonderful, attentive staff, a beautiful setting, and incredible food makes Maison Pic the perfect place for a meal. If Michelin ever decides to give out four-stars, this place will be one of the ones selected."

PIC,50,"A long-awaited family pause at Maison Pic, Valence","Everything was fantastic from the ultra smooth check-in process and the hotel, the comfort of the rooms, the welcome at the restaurant and the explanation about the culinary journey prepared by the chef, the wine-food pairing proposal, very original and well-thought, and ultimately of course the climax of the day, the meals all exceptional, in beauty, originality and of course taste."

PIC,50,Fantastic experience,"What to say, it was simply perfect, great food as expected, friendly and very professional staff. All started in the garden with a great cocktail in a peaceful atmosphere. I do recommend the option to match the dishes with the drinks, which is very well done and explained."

PIC,50,Truly special in the most unexpected way.,"Our third visit to Maison Pic over 19 years and the most special of all.  Our room, a Deluxe Double, was stylish and comfortable, just the right size for an overnight stay, with an excellent bathroom.  The outdoor area for pre-dinner drinks is furnished with casual flair and the soft clubbing music in the background set the tone of a visit here, where life is to be enjoyed with a sense of fun.  The beautifully-appointed dining room is more elegant and formal but the highly professional staff remain warm and friendly at all times.  There is a mandatory 10-course menu for all diners: we very much enjoyed the first three courses, in particular a mind-blowing beetroot creation, but to impress the diner through 10 courses seems an impossibility for even the best chef and their team.  What made our evening extra special was a tableside chat with Anne-Sophie Pic, followed by an invitation to view the kitchen and then to eat one of our courses at the ‘chef’s table’! Again Anne-Sophie Pic spent long periods chatting with us, in between supervising the creation of dishes by her assistant chefs. What a very special evening.  A pleasant, though fairly ordinary, breakfast was taken in the courtyard dining area, and a warm goodbye from reception staff confirmed the tone of our entire, wonderful visit."

PIC,30,Not up to previous standards,"- No ""a la carte"" food. A single tasting menu which makes it very long for a minimum of 3 hours and half service.  - Slow service, with a too long wait (15-20mn) between the many courses. You start digestion before the next course is served  - I would suggest to have a second shorter menu  - The quality of the food was fine but not to the usual standard.  - Having known the place run by the father, I would suggest to rename the restaurant just “Anne Sophie” as both cuisine are completely different with their own personal imprint.  - We got a very good impression of Anne Sophie Pic, when she came to visit each table in the dining room, as she has charm and a kind personality"

Troisgros,50,Near perfection,"We had a family lunch going with menu gastronomique. The place is neatly renovated, service is perfect and the food is outstanding. Close to perfection in my sense."

Troisgros,50,Not to be missed!,Wonderful culinary experience ! Troisgros is part of Relais Chateaux and amply deserves its 3 Michelin stars!

Troisgros,50,Genious,"Wonderful place ,service,and food Warm welcome ,professional service. We gad very good food and delicious wines"

Troisgros,50,Beautiful place and excellant food,"Probably the most memorable and beautiful dining room and the whole place is simply stunning. The menu was seasonal, original and delicious."

Troisgros,50,One of the finest in the world...,It took me 40 years to get to dine at this temple of gastronomy and in their new location in Oches. A bit hard to find but well worth it. Cab fare from the train station is about 16 -17 E . The new location...More

Troisgros,50,Breathtaking and delicious,"Delicious meal, amazing atmosphere, exceptional service. Absolute 5 star experience. Head chef made an effort to speak to customers and was lovely to talk too. Incredible experience for which we forever remember."

Troisgros,50,Beautiful place and excellant food,"Probably the most memorable and beautiful dining room and the whole place is simply stunning. The menu was seasonal, original and delicious."

Troisgros,50,One of the finest in the world...,"It took me 40 years to get to dine at this temple of gastronomy and in their new location in Oches. A bit hard to find but well worth it. Cab fare from the train station is about 16 -17 E .    The new location in Oches is incredible as it the decor and visual stimulus on a spring day is worthy of mention. It doesn't get much better that this  This place is legendary and I went with the full tasting menu with pared wines about 450E, with service included which for a place of this caliber for a 3.5 hour meal is not unreasonable..  I noted that they do have a mini menu for children. However I dont recommend this place for for children who can not grasp the experience any more than they could at Burger King. ( I did see an american couple who brought their 7 and 8 yearold girls to dine. The girls wore head phones and played with their phones the whole time oblivious to everything...What a sad waste)  I traveled here from LA...6000 miles just for the experience as a pilgrim to a shrine. Cuisine has always interested me to the extent I took professional training to better appreciate its nuances.The tasting menu is 7 courses + 3 amuse and +3 deserts    It was a further treat to me to be invited into the kitchen to talk with the chefs, who were both as great at their meals. Chef.Ceasar Troisgros has studied with Thomas Keller of the French Laundry, and several of his dishes reflected some of Kellers technique.. It was a pleasure to watch the brigade from Gard to Sous working with such focus and attention to detail. I think I enjoyed that experience as much as I did the meal. It was food for the soul.  The wait staff, too, was warm and outgoing, and eager and would carefully explain in detail each course answering detailed questions as to ingredients.    At Troisgros, turn your self over to their skill and passion. you will not regret it. I have dined around the world seeking out the best of the best Troisgros is one of the finest and has held 3*** with Michelin for 50 years !! Come here with having done some research and reading in it's history and background. and it will be more fulfilling than you can immigine !!!!    I liked it a whole bunch................... .."

Troisgros,50,Breathtaking and delicious,"Delicious meal, amazing atmosphere, exceptional service. Absolute 5 star experience. Head chef made an effort to speak to customers and was lovely to talk too. Incredible experience for which we forever remember."

Troisgros,50,Still the best in the world,"We have been dining here for 25 years. This was our first trip to the scene they opened in Ouches ( ten miles from Roanne). This is still our gold standard. This new place is stunning architecturally but the cooking has not changed. Great food and service. Get the ""menu"" - It changes seasonally. These are great cooks - let them serve you what is the best on the current market. Very expensive - worth every $. Also a great wine list"

Troisgros,40,Dinner with friends,"Very good food. Excellent service - though sometimes a little too fast! Interesting range of wines. Unusual architecture but allows for well spaced tables. Really enjoyed the ""drunken mussels"" - through my serving was predominantly other shellfish - and the oyster dish. I was surprised that the cod fish went so well with cocoa! I was surprised that the amuse bouche and the first course of the trading menu were so similar in composition (and taste) and the pana cotta was rather lacking in any flavour."

Troisgros,40,Wonderful moment,"Let us start by the 4 ""stars"" instead of 5. It is only because did not like her main course. Wrong choice, not a chef mistake, just a wrong choice.  Otherwise everything was perfect. Staff is very nice and very professional. The place is just beautiful, tables are large and neighbors are far.  Food is excellent, perfect (Alone I would have put 5). We had caviar as an appetizer and it was delicious and nicely prepared. wines are perfect and you can choose not so expensive ones.  What a great moment"

Troisgros,50,"Amazing location, excellent food",Had the pleasure to visit troisgros in his old location in Roanna many years ago. Up on reading the move to a domaine in Ouches found it high time to revisit and found it still some amazing experience. Booked a overnight stay in the hotel and had a fabulous diner in the new restaurant. Both were exceptional. The menu was a pleasure of good cooking and lovely products for 260 Euro without drinks. Its expensive and was not blown away by something I have never seen before but each plate was cooked to perfection. The wines are also very expensive but a big wine list can appeal to everyones taste I guess. The service was perfect. Younger crew than before but by now means less efficient. Very well done and at a very good tempo. Think we had some 10 courses in total in something over three hours. The rooms in the hotel also are expensive (from 300 Euros) but very well and tastefull decorated. The domaine is amazing with lots of walking possibilities. The breakfast the day after was again 30 Euro per person but was again from very high standard with all very fresh and home made things. We had a loverly weekend witch costs a lot but when its good its worth it. Very pleased to returned although is quite a travel from Belgium. Hope to revisit in future.

Troisgros,50,Toward ultimate perfection,"There is a value in tradition. At least you are on solid ground. You cannot build a palace on sand. Next comes work and creativity. You have all that at Troisgros and the result is amazing. True, it's not cheap, but you will not regret it."

Troisgros,50,Exceptional Restaurant,"My husband and I celebrated our 16th wedding anniversary at Troisgros and were overwhelmed by the experience. Unlike any other Michelin restaurant we have dined at, Troisgros is on another level altogether. We will never forget our night - an incredible experience. I cannot speak highly enough of the quality of the food, the staff, the service, the ambience and restaurant - it is outstanding. My husband and I can't wait to return and celebrate another anniversary, hopefully in the not too distant future."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,Love declaration,"This is a truly 3 Michelin star experience. Such a perfect journey. What a treat. The ingredients used, the presentation, the taste and their magic ingredient: herbs. It was unique and a true testimonial that you can offer 3-stars experience to people! Merci merci merci!"

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,Travel your senses,My wife and I enjoyed this evening very much. Everything was perfectly prepared. We came ready for a 'voyage' and we had a great one. Thank you everyone for making our evening so very special.

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,great again,after many years we returned to this cozy place and enjoyed an innovative dinner. friendly service with some new experiences regarding ingredients and combinations.

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,"Enjoyed each bite, a wonderful experience","We ordered a four course that was actually 11-12 different portions. We enjoyed each and every portion, superb! Worth every penny! Three hours of delight!"

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,Finally a new 3 Michelin Stars in our Region: they are the best innovative kitchens here at Rhone Alpes,"Impeccable services, profissional, superb wine list , fantastic menu degustation, charming environment, Madade Maitre de Hotel de per si is 3 Stars too and not only the best Chef in a range of 200km from here."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,A real food experience,"On top of a hill facing the old town of Annecy, le Clos des Sens offers a really magnificent food experience.    We’ve had lunch together with my wife and have elected for the lunch menu called Petit Déjeuner (weird as it means breakfast).  That day, the menu was around cray fish and pike with very subtile sauces and side dishes.  All the products came from max 100 km around Annecy.    In his garden, the Chef produces his own pepper! The salt comes from nearby Swiss salt mine.  The bread comes from a nearby bakery.  The waiters are helpful but not overwhelming.    Just one downside, the wine offered with the menu though very good and regional is too little. For 35 euros extra you only get 2 glasses for 4 courses. This is not value for money. At the minimum they should add another glass with the desert, like a sweet Chardonnay from Bugey.    Anyway, one of the best restaurant I have ever visited. I highly recommend if you like haute cuisine."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,40,An experience for the senses,"A two star Michelin, this place is passionate about local, all natural, lake fish and foraged foods. The setting is dramatic, each table is set up like a stage, glass everywhere alonglise interesting are and wonderfully carved woods. Service is impeccable, overseen by chef's wonderful wife. Cuisine is interesting and unusual. It really deserves five stars, only reason I would give it 4.5 is that personally i am not a true fan of lake fish (my bad, not chef's)."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,40,Delectable,"We had a wedding anniversary dinner at Le Clos des Sens, and reserved on the strength of good reviews and recommendations from friends and colleagues. Laurent Petit is an acolyte of what he calls ""cuisine locavore"", which focuses on ingredients found regionally and in the closest lakes (Annecy, Geneva, Bourget). We took the 8 course menu - this was on balance a very good and delectable experience. That no single meat course is served is an element that may get some time to get used to; I did not find this a manco, but my wife and daughter did. The flavour combinations also require getting a little used to in one or two dishes - thus a small plate of trout from Lake Annecy topped with bits of escargots and mushrooms was served with a sauce that we all though was too ""acidulée"" . The first dish with finely sliced lamelles of mushroom, stuffed with various spices was very good, and so was the dish of 'féra'. Excellent cheese board with local cheeses from Savoie. We had a very good bottle of a local Chignin Bergeron from Gilles Berlioz.... a refaire"

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,Worth every star,"Chef Laurent Petit is a phenomenal chef. The kitchen runs like a Swiss watch. The food is beyond creative and divine. We had the 10 course dinner which was really more like 12 or 13 mouth savoring courses. I believe all the herbs, flowers and spices come from his own extensive gardens. Everything else is local including simple things like salt and bread. I will never forget this amazing dinner."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,10,Will probably lose their stars soon,"I'm sure this restaurant was good when it got it's stars, but it has turned into a very arrogant place with rude staff and mediocre food. There are lots of staff people running around but it is impossible to request anything and they rarely come and check on your food.    I usually enjoy these tasting menus, but I only liked one or 2 of the items. Most were mediocre, like a sliced mushroom without sauce (I could make it at home). Presentation was nice and the room was nice - but those were the only nice things.    The wine pairings were uninspired. After about 3 or 4 mediocre whites, we asked to switch to red. They brought one red and then a white that we really didn't like. When we asked to switch it to red, the sommelier refused.    At the beginning they asked what we don't eat and I told them that we don't eat shellfish. A bit later, they brought some snails. When I said something, the waitress snapped at me and said ""we didn't talk about snails, we talked about crawfish"". For the record, I mentioned shellfish and she said that the only shellfish was the crawfish. They did bring us something different, but she was really nasty about it.    Even the cheeses on the cheese cart were not as good as the ones in most fine restaurants in France.    Overall, this was a very disappointing and unpleasant experience.    There are other Michelin star restaurants in the area, I would recommend that people who want this type of experience go to one of the others."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,A singular gourmet experience with a fabulous view above Lake Annecy,"We've known this restaurant since the very beginning and have always adored M. Petit's cooking and Mme Petit's warm welcome. The current philosophy is strictly locavore, all ingredients coming from less than 100 kilometers away, and it's all lake fish or vegetables, needless to say more than expertly prepared. So much thought and research and love has gone into his food, it is admirable. And lake fish and crustaceans (crayfish from Lake Geneva) are in fact delicious. I doubt anyone in France maybe even Europe does a better job with locallly sources freshwater fish.  We had the ten course menu and enjoyed every dish. for the record, in the local lakes (Annecy, Geneva and Bourget) you find whitefish, perch, burbot, Northern pike, and the prized omble chevalier, the best tasting member of the char family, all wild, obviously. The preparations are eye-pleasing and incorporate locally grown vegetables and herbs from the garden. Cheeses and desserts were excellent.  The wine list quite complete.Try the local wines Marestel, Chignin Bergeron and Mondeuse.  This restaurant has 2 stars wince 2007.  The hotel is a Relais Chateau."

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,Excellent experience all around,Hands down one of the best dinners I've had. My husband and I enjoyed the 8 course dinner. It was a fun adventure from the first bite. Delicious amuse bouche start and it continued to satisfy to the end. Perfect wine pairing. Professional service. Beautiful location and nice ambiance.

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,50,Lovely lunch,Excellent restaurant! Delicious food and wonderful staff! The cheese platter is to die for! The wine list is excellent. I shall definitely be returning!

Restaurant Le Clos des Sens,40,"Excellent quality, good taste",I really enjoyed my dinner with friends at the restaurant Le Clos des Sens. Every dish was really tasteful and the chariot à fromages was one of the best I have ever seen and tasted. Very good wine selection. It is a good address for fine dining.

la marine,50,Absolutely the finest dining experience we have encountered.,"We were visiting Noirmoutier because my mother grew up on this amazing island. We went as a family to celebrate my mother's passing in 2020. My brother, Karl saw the Netflix show ""The chef's Table"" and told us all about it. We having been trying...More"

la marine,50,Local produce cooked perfectly.,This restaurant has two entrances and one kitchen. You may go in the marine entrance or the one next door but the quality of the foot is the same. We had a meal for seven that was top class. I started with local oysters and...More

la marine,40,Kindness and softness,"This was our first restaurant in Noirmoutier and we enjoyed the place, the food and the service. Thanks for that cool moment with children."

la marine,50,Excellent,We travelled especially to this island to visit this restaurant and were not disappointed. The service was second to none and the food was very good. I particularly enjoyed to appetisers and the fish courses

la marine,40,Seaside Delight,"Enjoying a Kronenbourg 1664 while eating a delicious beef fillet is definitely the way to spend a Friday afternoon. Make sure to order the fries. Delicious!! Family friendly with accommodations for your furry four legged friends, they are welcome in the outdoor seating area."

la marine,30,you pay,"you pay , the view on the sea side , and not small , one coupe of champagne is there for 11 euros , zhe more , this restaurant is banking on his room situation"

la marine,50,A once in a lifetime experience,"It is almost difficult to describe this experience with words. We found La Marine through an episode of Chef's Table and it was to be the peak of our family vacation in France. Even so, it exceeded our expectations. A warm welcome, impeccable service and dish after dish which delighted both the eye and our tastebuds! We weren't sure wether to choose the large menu but we're glad we did in the end. Amazing! The experience was greatly enhanced by the fact that we stayed at the family's hotel next door and could continue with a fantastic breakfast the morning after. This was truly a once in a lifetime experience I would recommend to anyone!"

la marine,50,Fabulous Dinner,"We had a fabulous dinner at this tiny restaurant on the coast of France. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Each dish was an adventure in creativity, beauty and taste ... the numerous amuse bouche set the stage and the meal continued a great gastronomic adventure. The course of the evening was a wonderful desert of pine ice cream on a seaweed biscuit with sprinkles of chocolate and other sweets. Lovely!    Go ... You will not be disappointed!"

la marine,50,Best meal in my life,"This was hands down the best meal in my life. After taking a long drive all the way from Bordeaux, we arrived at the restaurant thirsty and hungry. We ordered the no 1 menu, which consisted of two starters, two mains and two desserts. Every dish, including the mouth amusers, was perfectly cooked and blew my mind. The Erika oyster was the largest and freshest I have ever seen, and it tasted so delicious with the squid ink marinate, layer of sugar and the powdered bacon.    This review would be too long if I were to describe all the dishes, but some other highlights were the barbecued asparagus, the tender duck, and the smoked milk ice cream.    For anyone wishing to experience mind blowing seafood dishes, this is the restaurant to visit. Wouldn't be surprised if it obtained a third michelin star soon."

la marine,50,Gastronomic Journey of Endless Delight,"Having watched Alexandre Couillon's episode on Netflix's Chef's Table France, we knew that we had to make the Noirmoutier detour for our roadtrip vacation in France - and it sure did not disappoint! We booked our table 2 months in advance, though it appeared to be quite full already.    The restaurant is small, with five tables set up in a cosy setting. We ordered the 6-course menu, partially for the famous ""Erika"" oyster, and so began the amazing lunch experience that was started with an additional 6 welcome dishes before the first starter dish came. We sat through three hours of a delightful food journey, ranging from perfectly barbecued asparagus, to the famous shapeless Erika oyster, and to the lovely mains of fish and duck that were cooked to ultimate perfection.    The experience was topped off with meeting with Alexandre Couillon himself, who was visibly busy from the kitchen work, but was happy to take a photo with these eager tourists and showed us the exquisite fireplace that was one of the opening scenes in the episode, and was also used to smoke one of their ice cream desserts.    We left the restaurant yearning for more - this was by far the greatest highlight of our trip to France, on an otherwise remote island of Noirmoutier."

la marine,50,Charming en delightfull,"Don't eat before you go, you will have pleanty to eat and discover. the signature dish Erika clam is a must and the frechness of the products is incredible big size portions for gastronomique restaurant but you will enjoy every bite of it."

la marine,50,Unpretentious Pleasure,"We had been meaning to visit La Marine for some time and finally got around to it and what a pleasure it was.    The outside is quite unprepossessing but one immediately gets taken up a level in the reception.    We had decided as we had eventually booked and arrived there we would have the 9 course menu with matched wine.    My wife and I had a debate about a glass of champagne as an apéro. We decided against it as we have found some restaurants can overdo the quantity of wine served ( yes I know you don't have to drink it all!).    I think in retrospect it was a mistake as it would have been perfect with the exquisite canapés, there was one truffles like one with mackerel and coffee that was perfect.    I won't describe every course but for me there were two highlights. L'huître Noire, I generally think chefs cannot improve oysters but this dish was superb. The other course I really enjoyed was The Pintade it was without doubt the most tender, perfectly prepared and served guinea-fowl I've ever had.    The wines were not grand wines but the matching as one would expect worked. There was a local focus on the which included Muscadet and a Pinot Noir from Brem. I did find the Côtés de Jura both novel and interesting as I was unaware of it.    I mentioned that it's unpretentious it's a smallish restaurant, my wife and I were in the catch all 'smart casual' other diners also but at either end of the definition. The staff were really relaxed there was not the question 'are you enjoying it' after every mouthful and they did not hover. They were friendly and happy to engage in conversation about the food. Other Michelin restaurants could learn from them.    Of course we are going back."

la marine,40,A very good experience,"Menu changes twice daily, depending on the catch and seasonal vegetables available from the chef's garden nearby. Very fresh products, cooked to perfection. A choice between a menu of 6 or 9 dishes. Because one is plied with numerous amuse-bouche even before the ""real thing"" starts, the 6 menu is just perfect. But the 9 dish menu is also terribly tempting (lobster!). Staff is charming and very attentive. They were very accommodating to one in our party who was pregnant and couldn't eat raw fish. They whipped up langoustines for her, in place of the oyster for example.  The only thing amiss was that the chef didn't come out of the kitchen to go round the tables, when it is a very small restaurant et cosy. It would have been lovely to congratulate him in person. The decor was also maybe a bit modern for my taste."

la marine,50,Wonderful meal,"Our dinner here was wonderful. The amuse bouches were magical and each of our four courses, with matched wines, was delicious."

la marine,50,Perseiden and stars in La Marine / Noirmoutier,"Perseiden are falling down in La Marine – especially in August.  The stars are shining here usually the year long.    You have to make reservations in this small and elegant restaurant.  Then you will be greeted by the kitchen with 10+ shooting stars: a variety of potatoes from Noirmoutier (icecream in a cone, a chip, a mash), 3 different soups (tomato and cream fresh, carotte and estragon with a small piece of oyster, fish broth with a small piece of sardine), a smoked Mullet on its bone, a faked truffle (out of bread) with an infusion of maquereau, chip of seaweed with a condensed cream of fish,…  Everything delicious and all goes well with a glass of champagne.    Then – after having enjoyed the “Perseide” – we moved to the stars: a menu composed of 7 courses (9 courses max). You do enjoy a variety of the sea like coquillages & crustaces (a deep and intense dive through the harbour), L’huitre noire de Erika, Marquereau and Lieu jaune de ligne – generous portions, the design of the plates outstanding (the oyster on a white plate with large circles – resembling a drop of water in the sea). Bretgane at its best.  As main course the pigeon was served perfect in style and taste.  The dessert: Une balade dans le bois de la Caize (tree = icecream of spruce, soil = chocolate crumbles, moss = green bisquit crumbles) – real a poem (reminds me at the Atelier de Crenn in San Francisco). It was followed by Fraises de pays and….  We were overwhelmed by this fantastic art of cooking. Kudos to the maître Alexandre Couillon and his team.    By the way: as we did choose a wine pairing almost every dish came with a different wine from France (Muscadet from the region, Sauvignon from the south, Chinin Blanc from the Loire, red from Beaujolais, red cremant from Jura…). Poured not in small portions.    And at the end the kitchen says Good Bye with another flight of “Perseides” : 10+ sweeties as post desserts.  We ordered a vervenne tea at the end of this outstanding dinner : hot water over fresh, green leaves of Vervenne – served in a stylish tea pot (other restaurants are offering just tea bags).  If you have the chance: visit the La Marine – it is a real great experience."

la marine,50,best seafood ever,"if you are in to local catched seafood and home grown vegetables, it is a must visit. the restaurant is small, cosy, has friendly service, and a master chef in the kitchen.  however, it has a 2 michelin star rating (wich imho is not important) it comes with a price tag. i loved it and found our visit all worth it."

la marine,50,The best meal we have had since we were here last!,"We returned here after being impressed on our first visit in May 2014. It's quite a trek across the island to get L'Herbaudiere but it's worth it! You really have to stay locally - you wouldn't want to drive after a meal like this. We stay at the Hotel Bord a Bord which is just a few yards away and is not bad at all.    There is a choice on the menu - four, seven or nine courses! We chose four but there are so many 'amuses bouches' and 'petits fours' that it might as well be nine. All the food is delicious and so imaginative. Noirmoutier is famous for its potatoes (reputedly the most expensive in the world) and one of the 'amuses bouches' is a kind if signature dish - a trinity of potato creations; potato ice cream in a cone. a potato crisp and a potato soup. That was only one of several little savoury tasters - and all before the starter arrived! The food is mainly fish (not surprising as the fishing harbour is across the road) although there was a beautiful pigeon breast on the menu this time. Many of the vegetables come from La Marine's own garden.    We chose the menu with a glass of wine with each course - another reason not to drive afterwards...    The staff are very friendly and helpful and the decor is a surprise after the ordinary exterior of the building. Definitely a wow factor as you enter.    All in all a wonderful experience. We will be back!"

la marine,50,Romantic and classically French,"This was the highlight of our visit to the Vendee Region.Our visit that had been planned for some six months. The port area is small and delightful. The restaurant la Marine takes centre stage looking clean and we'll cared for from the outside. The entrance is well thought out, inviting you in to a very welcoming modern interior.    The front of house team were friendly and professional. We had already been in touch via email, we tried to reserve a table some six weeks in advance. Fortunately, they found a table for us and let us know by email. This is not a restaurant to turn up ""on the off chance"". From our base in Led Sables d'Olonne it was a good round trip (part of the experience).    Now to the food, which was fantastic. We decided on the No2 menu which included a starter, 2 main plats and a dessert. In addition to this we were provided with 4 amuse-bouche, the first being a trio of Noirmoutier potatoes comprising of a delicate crisp, a potatoe soup and potatoe ice cream in a cone. The whole meal was made from locally produced and caught produce, much from Chef Alexandre Couillion's own garden. The fish was locally caught and cooked to perfection as was the guiniea fowl. The desserts that followed were simple yet perfectly executed.    A wonderful evening, the attention to detail, the setting, the service and the food mark this out as one of the best restaurant's we have experienced."

la marine,50,"Wow, what a superb experience !","Being our wedding anniversary this weekend, we decided to have a nice dining experience so we booked up for la Marine.    I've eaten in some great restaurants but this was a real gastronomic experience of flavours and pure quality. We were served countless ""amuse bouche"" (small appetisers) which were all so very different but wonderfully prepared and they all had their own distinct taste. This was even before the other 4 courses arrived!  Even the breads and the different butters were all different and made on the premises.    In total, the experience lasted 3 hours and we were certainly not disappointed. The service, the ambience and certainly the food, made the evening an unforgettable experience. Obviously this doesn't come cheap but the prices are not ridiculous for an evening close to perfection.    The restaurant itself is small, about 25 covers per night, and the decor is very 80's in my opinion, almost Austin Powers, retro style but very well done.    It's a must try if you live not too far away or you are visiting this area of France. Don't be disappointed and book well in advance."

la marine,50,True gastronomy - the chef is a real superstar,"Nothing to say that hasn't already been said. What a luck it is to have such a first class restaurant in Noirmoutier.    A. Couillon is the real thing : creative, working with fabulous ingredients, yet humble and genuinely authentic.    I loved everything from the lunch we had there, truly up to its 2 stars standard. I have been to quite a few 3 stars and am sure this one is pretty close to reaching this level. At ~100€ for the 5 courses menu, value is really good for such high standard and quality.    The wine selection is great.    Only downside would be the the black and white decoration, which I did not find very chic. However, this doesn't really have any importance, as that given the outstanding quality of the food, you could be eating in a cellar and still not care about the environment !    I can't wait to go back there on my next vacation in Noirmoutier."

la marine,50,What a culinary experience,"We had to cancel our original reservation as our grand son did not feel well. I was heart broken....  Another day, we stopped by the Port de l'Herbaudiere and were across from La Marine. I decided to take a chance and have an early lunch. I was greeted by Mrs. Celine Couillon and was offered a table in a quiet corner where we would not bother other clients.Amazing enough, our grand so enjoyed his food so much that he did not say a word.  We had one of our best meals ever. From the bread, butter, seafood, vegetables, dessert, service, everything was first class. I specially enjoyed the fusion, oriental touch.    I have placed La Marine on my bucket list as I want to return there in the future.  An experience not to be missed."

la marine,50,UNIK!!!,"Amazing food, perfection…..all perfect from the beginning to the End!!! It was a pleasure to Meet Alexandre and her wife…. If you pass by Noirmoutier island don't miss la marine restaurant. Thank you to la Marine team for this Culinary experience."

la marine,50,Best food eaten in France,Degustation style; awesome french cuisine. Tastes and textures that you wouldn't believe.

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Lovely lunch on the terrace,"We were lucky to have a sunny day in Oct, being able to sit on the terrace overlooking the river. Food was overwhelmingly abundant (all girls in this party) and looked extremely beautiful in presentation. Besides the 3-course market menu, there were little snacks served upon arrival, amuse bouche before the first course, and extra sweets/cakes at dessert time. Definitely recommend stopping here for lunch for both its value and atmosphere.    As for the market menu, everyone in my party loved the first course of a perfect egg 64 degrees; it was so yummy. For the main course of beef (paleron), one person felt it was overcooked and didn't even finish while the others enjoyed it but not wow'ed by it. Maybe we are just not used to the way the beef was cooked. Dessert however was excellent."

Le Vivier restaurant,50,consistantly excellent,"Our first lunch at Le Vivier (normally dinner) and lived up to expectations, the menu de marche was very pleasing and seasonal, and with all the extras and service overall great value."

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Fabulously accommodating,"Always love lunch at Le Vivier. The staff are truly excellent - kind, knowledgeable and nothing is too much trouble. We had some tricky dietary requirements in our party but all was managed wonderfully and all the food was spectacular to the eyes and palate. The setting on the river is of course also fabulous - trés reposant. Un grand merci toute l’équipe!"

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Sensational!,What an absolutely sensational meal! Refined cuisine with a mix of complex flavors artfully presented in a sophisticated and relaxed ambiance with excellent service. My partner and I have been together for 4 years and tried many restaurants in that time (including a one-star Michelin restaurant in Paris just last week). Le Vivier is probably the best meal we've had all the way around. Absolutely fantastic and highly recommended.

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Incredible gem in Provence,"If you are anywhere near Isle-Sur-la-Sorgue, don’t miss Le Vivier! The food and service were outstanding, the setting lively and the wine list was impressive. Our best meal in Provence!"

Le Vivier restaurant,40,Another enjoyable visit,"Excellent service and wine discussion and comments, good food and a relaxing evening for a celebration."

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Outstanding food and service,Outstanding food and service of the highest standard. Really exceptional. Absolutely charming owner and team. Every dish something new and exciting with wonderful tastes. This is a stand out restaurant.

Le Vivier restaurant,40,A lovely lunch at an old favourite,"We have been going to Le Vivier on and off for around 20 years - it’s an institution in the area and the fact they were almost full on a Wednesday lunchtime shows they must be doing something right Since the last time we had been there I think they had acquired a Michelin star, so expectations were high and generally it didn’t disappoint. We went for the €48 fixed menu du jour with an additional cheese course and the effort they had put into even a “basic” menu was obvious and showed a creative and imaginative blend of flavours. We were very impressed with the service; we liked the clear way the menu was set out, particularly the list of wines by the glass and we thought the herb infusion delivered with our cheese course was different and imaginative. A couple of negatives - the rather doughy cumin roll delivered with the amuse-bouches didn’t really work and the noisette and chocolate pudding was a bit sickly. Overall, though, an excellent experience"

Le Vivier restaurant,50,"Excellent, interesting cooking.","Adept balance of precise cooking and robust flavours. Tuna and paella fantastic highlight amongst many. Great birthday dinner. Only negative, would have loved a table at the waters edge. Next time!"

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Great food and great service,We went there to celebrate my 30th birthday. The food was excellent for the price point. Well curated menu with seasonal ingredients. Left with a very full belly. We will come back again for another special occasion. Scenery was tranquille with a great view on the river.

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Excellent food and service.,Very good creative cuisine with subtle but great flavours Sitting by the river on the terrace was lovely and airy in the heat. Excellent service with a friendly smile. Great place for special lunch while the kids went kayaking.

Le Vivier restaurant,50,High class,"Excellent service, very beautiful place, pleasant atmosphere, great wine, delicious and beautiful food."

Le Vivier restaurant,10,Dishonest and inhospitable treatment of tourists,"At the end of our lunch on 16 July 2023, as we were paying the check, the waiter/manager told us that service was not included and asked if we would like to add anything to the bill. Slightly confused I asked twice if service was included (I specifically asked about service and not about gratuity), and twice he said no, that service was not included. I therefore added 50 euro to an already substantial bill (234 euro for 2, at lunch). However on further examination I am realizing that in fact a mandatory service fee is added by law to all restaurant and cafe bills in France. I don't mind tipping and always give gratuities of 20-25% when dining in the US, but I don't appreciate being lied to for a few extra euros just because I speak English and not French. I would've expected better of a Michelin-starred restaurant; the prices were certainly in line, but the service and hospitality were not."

Le Vivier restaurant,50,Perfection does exist - le Vivier is the proof of it,"From the first moment -arriving 10 minutes before the restaurant opened but the Chef d'entreprise Patrick Fischnaller opened the door with a smile- we knew we were in for a treat. The calm professionalism of the entire staff, the vivid passion of the sommelier, the frequent attention of the chef d’enterprise - all of this created the perfect setting. And the menu was fantastic. We went for the menu Gourmand with wine pairing, and every dish was a delicious surprise reflecting the presence of a confident chef. Thank you ! (And if there is a table available, we will be back next week !)"

Le Vivier restaurant,30,Disappointing,"Overall, we were disappointed with our overall experience at Le Vivier. We were excited to go to a Michelin Star restaurant while in France, but it didn’t live up to our expectations. While the food was different and of a Michelin star style, it was mainly the service that made us feel let down and not at the standard we expected.    We were constantly waiting for our wine glasses to be refilled and gladly would have done it ourselves, yet the bottle was taken away from the table. We were also stuck waiting for both our dessert and our bill for long amounts of time. We aren’t sure if this is because our table was in the corner, but there were times the waiters made eye contact with us and still did not ask if we wanted the bill. Tables that were around us, who arrived later than us, finished and had their tables cleaned before we were offered the bill.    The food was good, but not up to the standard we were expecting for a Michelin Star restaurant. We have had much better food at restaurants without a star, which left us disappointed.    Overall, we wouldn’t have spent €200 for this meal if we had known it would have been to this standard. We were looking forward to this meal our whole trip and unfortunately it fell flat for us."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,The best restaurant meal I've ever had! Number one!,"Due to Covid, our original booking was delayed by almost two years but we finally made it here, and wow was it worth the wait. Without further ado, here was our Jour de Fete:    ~ green coffee chiboust oyster: a very fresh oyster with an interestingly flavoured chiboust cream - 9/10  ~ white asparagus with pear, leek , sorrel: a delightful combination of textures and flavours - 9.5/10  ~ Tsarina egg with caviar, green banana, onion, vodka: again a wonderful combination and with excellent caviar - 9.5/10  ~ mackerel with beetroot, pickle: a punch of flavour here - 9.5/10  ~ lobster in broth of shrimp, coconut, orange blossom - beautiful melding of flavours - 10/10  ~ wood-fired pigeon in bernaise sauce: perfectly cooked and moist - 10/10  ~ dim sum of mushrooms and truffle: this was outstanding, the best 'mushroom soup' (sorry for the simplified description) I've ever had. Cannot be beat, simply fantastic - 10/10  ~ citrus ribbons, milky meringue, herbs sorbet: fresh and light - 9.5/10  ~ Marquis de Bechamel soft cake: light, yet flavourful - 9/10    Each and every dish was excellent, with only very fresh and high quality ingredients being used. Not one dish was average, each was varying level of excellent. Presentation was also very good. A wonderful whirlwind of flavours, textures, and delights as we made our way through each course.    Apart from some of the wonderful homecooked meals I've had at family and friends homes, I can say this was the best restaurant meal I've ever had. For me, even amongst other 3 Michelin star restaurants, Michel Guerard's is the best of the best.    The decor and setting is very peaceful pleasant. Service was very good, but not excellent. There appeared to be quite a few new staff or 'trainees' on hand this particular evening, and we had one minor incident. We had a food item being served fall from the plate and onto our linen table cloth, and rather than the server remove it and bring back a fresh replacement from the kitchen the server just picked it up with a fork and spoon and placed it back onto our plate. We didn't wish to reprimand the server, but we did mention the incident to the manager so that the server could be trained in the proper response to such an accident. The manager was apologetic, replaced those dishes, and I guess since feeling bad about what had happened, gave us a tour of the kitchen. It was a minor incident, but well handled by the manager.    I prefer to only comment about a restaurants decor, service, or other amenities, and keep the rating solely to the food itself. I rate this restaurant a 10/10. For me, it is the best. I have yet to have a better restaurant meal. I can't wait to go back and dine here again!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Possibly the best meal we have ever had,"This was not my first 3-Michelin star dining experience, but it did remind me why that 3td star is hard to get.    From the moment we were welcomed to the restaurant, to when we strolled back to our room, we were treated like royalty but in a thoroughly subtle and expert manner. Likewise the food and wine were tasty and a delight to consume.    Bravo!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Still the Best,We have been to many 3 star micheline restaurants around the world and this remains the best. Not to be missed

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Fantastic... as always,"We had the pleasure of spending a week here towards the end of last year so were happy to return in the early summer sunshine and enjoy a menu that incorporated some of the best of the season's produce.    If you are dining here it is worth taking the slightly longer (2 extra courses) of the two tasting menus as this includes the classic truffle zephyr which is an incredibly light and flavoursome dish. The dining room and service continue to be relaxed and friendly in style whilst of course maintaining a certain grace and elegance.    Dishes that we enjoyed in the winter have been updated to use seasonal ingredients, such as white asparagus. The quality of the cooking continues to dazzle, with dishes incredibly well thought out, but never overworked or tweaked or tweezered too much. As a result, everything eats very well indeed and has you reaching for some more bread to mop up the last morsel of a divine sauce.    The pastry section is again very strong, with a wonderfully light and flavoursome lemon pre-dessert being particularly impressive, as well as the lighter, updated take on the classic gateau bechamel.    The wine list - entirely French - is both broad as well as deep in many areas with an impressive selection of vintages available for a lot of the wines. If you enjoy your wine, it has some real treasures for you to discover.    As well as the main (3*) dining room, we also enjoyed a couple of dinners at L'Orangerie, which is effectively the a la carte version of the 3* dining room with all dishes produced in the same kitchen as the 3*. As well as the legendary classics that are served here, there is also a nice selection of new dishes. That said, we couldn't resist the classics such as the morel pillow and the wonderfully flavoursome lobster cooked in the hearth. The service in here is led by the wonderful Nabil who makes the entire experience even more enjoyable.    If you enjoy fine food and wine with classical roots, then you will be hard pushed to find many venues more enjoyable than here."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Divine harmony,"Dining here is an unforgettable experience. Just walking into the beautifully updated historic dining room is breathtaking. The room is incredibly tastefully designed, balancing the rustic with the refined and the historic with the modern. The harmony achieved in the interior design just sets the stage for the perfect service, friendly but pleasingly correct, the beautiful china, some of it based on paintings hanging elsewhere on the property and the the food. I have never tasted any dishes more finely and perfectly balanced. Like in a Bach fugue many melodies come together to a harmonious whole. What a grand and unsurpassed pleasure to be able to partake in the artful creations of the chef. Thank you so much for this sublime evening."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Reinvented & reinvigorated + L'Orangerie,"Last time we visited we were wowed by the style and the quality of the cooking here, so it was a great pleasure to see that it is even better than we remembered it was.    The format and content of the menu have been rejigged so it is tasting menu only - when the cooking is so strong why wouldn't you want to try as many dishes as possible!?    Most of the dishes are new, although there are quite a few that are clearly a nod to or a clear evolution of Michel Guerard's classic creations such as the morel mushroom pillows and the most thoughtfully reimagined marquis de bechamel dessert. A selection of the classic dishes are available in the newly created L'Orangerie restaurant which is in the next room (see below for review).    The key style here is a lightness of touch in their cuisine, as well as using relatively ordinary ingredients to stellar effect; their leek dish elevates this humble vegetable to a whole new level.    Needless to say the service is superb and it is relatively relaxed in style, a lot more so than you would find in say a Paris 3*. The wine list is of course entirely French with a wonderful selection from hard to find producers and vintages.    We were fortunate enough to enjoy the same menu here twice in a week and it was just as enjoyable the second time around. This really is one of the greatest 3* Michelin restaurants in the world.    L'Orangerie:    The L'Orangerie offers one the opportunity to enjoy a selection of Michel Gerard's famous classic dishes, a selection of his greatest hits if you like.    The quality of the food and service is just as strong in this room as it is in the main 3* restaurant. There is now a beautiful dessert trolley from which the generous offering is beautifully plated table side for a little bit of added theatre.    This is somewhere that is truly timeless and offers fantastic dishes executed at the very highest level."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Literal perfection. Three star Michelin at the very highest level,"Returned after 40 years to be blown away by the changes, yet food and service still 100%    The chef has held three Michelin stars 44 straight years amd it shows    In a word  Perfection    The suites are beautiful with white painted floors and immaculate decoration    The common areas are full of flowers and fine paintings and furniture. The three restaurants all have individual appeal.    Staff will help with anything.    The gardens, pool, tennis courts all work for energetic guests. The huge theme spa is yet another level.    Food that you will recall months later for creativity and excellence    Travel the world, but find your way to the very south of France, at least once and indulge in the beat of the best"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,"wonderful lunch, great teamwork","We brought our French friend from Paris for a special lunch, and we were not disappointed. We ordered from the Terroir Sublime menu (only 139 euros!) - both the salmon and the pigeon were perfect. The service team was excellent from beginning to end, and it was a special thrill to have Michel Guerard visit our table near the end of the lunch. We especially enjoyed the atmosphere in the lounge (aperitifs before and coffee after the meal)."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Perfect,"This french institution is a perfect setting. Wonderful decor, elegant ambiance, professional and top flight staff. And the food. Well, the Louvre of gastronomy. Mr Guerard is there, watching everything. Just perfection! Bravo le chef! And thank you for your love for so many years!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Exceptional food,"Having declined an aperitif in the lovely gardens we were shown to our table in the main dining room. This is a beautiful room. Oil paintings on the walls, antique furniture, well chosen and distinctive ornements, beautiful flowers both on the tables and on the various dressers: all make for a really attractive setting . The food was glorious. We had the exceptionally good mushroom pillow and the (slightly complicated) egg with caviar followed by the guinea fowl and the beef, both excellent. We chose a pre phylloxera wine which was both majestic and refined.  For dessert we had the emblematic gateau moelleux - a triumph of rhubarb ice cream and abricot puree on a bed of wonderfully soft cake.  The staff was very charming and attentive, with a maitre d and a sommelier, both ladies, particularly knowledgeable.  The only criticism was a slightly too fast pace between courses and a really long wait for the herbal tea in a deserted lounge.  On the whole a true reussite!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Amazing,Worth the 3 stars they have. They have had the 3 stars for over 30 years and there’s a good reason why - its well deserved. We’re vegetarians and a menu was created especially for us. Every dish was carefully prepared with great composition and perfection. It was all very tasty and refined. The service was impeccable but also accommodating and friendly. Highly recommended

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,40,Restaurant review ... a different standard to the hotel,"Our meal was exquisite .. beautifully appointed dining room, excellent staff, appealing menu & then there’s is the food. The Vichyssoise was divine .. intensely creamy, served with a white truffle mousse and a black truffle. The tuna in papillote was delicate and delicious, and we continued with the filet de boeuf .. the champagne cocktail with raspberry was a perfect match.    When it comes to the quality of the hotel at Michel Guerard .. be prepared for a different standard. At the breakfast table we were asked to complete the room service menu to let the kitchen know our request .. the waitress understood my polite refusal. She kindly provided a cheese plate, together with our order for omelettes. One thing the French do well is to cook an omelette ‘baveuse’ ie soft / wet.    The twin beds in our room were not so comfortable and being on wheels, moved far too easily. A single sachet of instant coffee per person is insufficient, and yes, we did ask for more on our second evening, but they did not appear.    Arriving at the hotel around 3pm, our request to eat a snack & have coffee proved rather a challenge. The hotel didn’t seem set up for ‘out of hours’ eating, and by 4pm we were kindly told that staff are returning to the kitchen for the evening meal, and we were provided with foie gras and a salad. The electrics had gone off, so the coffee could not be made.    We loved the restaurant, it is top notch, but the hotel is very average."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,An exceptional and unique dinner,"Clearly with a 3* Michelin rating one is going to have nothing other than high expectations; having dined at quite a few 3* rated restaurants, I can confidently say that this is one of the very best I have eaten at. Of course at this level the standards are usually high, there are quite often some dishes that are weaker than others that diminish one's overall enjoyment. Here, every single dish was exceptionally good.    If you enjoy faddy Nordic style fine dining then this isn't the place for you. If you want to enjoy food that showcases the finest produce, classical technique and subtle whimsical twists resulting in delicious dishes then you are in the right place.    The service whilst extremely attentive was unusually friendly and not at all stuffy which really suited the ethos and style of the restaurant. Wine was served without any fuss or attitude which is very refreshing, especially for a restaurant of this calibre in France. The wine list is unsurprisingly virtually all French and offers a broad array of prestige bottles and if you look carefully there are some real gems at incredibly inviting prices which is always a generous gift for wine lovers.    All of the courses demonstrated exemplary technique paired with a lightness of touch so that no dish was too heavy or too rich. Plating was unfussy and displayed the restrained elegance that this entire hotel and restaurant exudes. There was a beautiful morel and truffle pillow (in effect a giant pasta parcel) which had a decadently silky sauce yet was never too rich. A lobster finished in the fireplace to give it a subtle smokiness was another perfect example of how you can achieve an incredible spectrum of flavours from seemingly few ingredients (in reality the sauces involved many many ingredients and took lots of time to prepare).    The desserts showcased a stellar pastry section. A verbena soufflé was perfectly light and fragrant and the accompanying sauce and ice-cream a perfect pairing. I simply - even in 3* restaurants - have never had a better soufflé from both a technical and flavour perspective. A frozen béchamel cake with rhubarb ice-cream was another beautiful example of technique and lightness of touch.    Whilst the cuisine here very obviously has classical French roots the dishes that are served are whimsical takes on classics and all have a lightness about them so that they feel very modern; they are certainly updated classics. Eugenie Les Bains is a little tucked away and about a two hours drive from most airports but it is more than worth the journey to experience cosseting hospitality and the very finest cuisine. I'm trying to work out when I can find time to return!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Food heaven,"We had visited many years ago with friends, returned on the way down to spain , food was fabulous, service was excellent, and we enjoyed the evening , hotel is immaculate, and steeped in history,"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Worth to pay a visit to that remote place just to eat there,"A traditional restaurant, where the excellence comes from the quality of the raw material and the honest cooking, not thinking on the shine of the cook but the satisfaction of the guest.  Considering the service, the quality of the food and the perfect cooking and presentation, it costs less than what it is worth."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Oustanding Hotel,The whole experience of this hotel is something everyone should do. The hotel is luxurious and amenities first class. The outdoor swimming pool was brilliant: well maintained and excellent water quality. The 3 Michelin starred restaurant was outstanding. The staff were friendly and relaxed.

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Oustanding !...,My second visit after ten years. Same quality. Awesome ! 3 Michelin stars withot doubt ! great service and experience .

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Grande cuisine.,This is Guerard’s historical restaurant and it is still at its best. No surprise with the dishes and perfect service. We also tried the « Minceur » menu which is worthwhile trying.

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Wonderful restaurant,The best restaurant and food I have ever eaten. The signature dishes are brilliant and it deserves its three Mitchelin stars. Michel Guerard is an incredible chef and at 83 years is extremely agile and fit.

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Spectacular!,"Simply delicious, fresh, professional, immaculately presented and in fabulous surroundings! Can't wait to revisit!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,My #1 favorite restaurant in France!!!,"Not sure if it was the walk around the organic garden or the 3 hour spa session but each course seem to reveal new taste from each ingredient as if this was the first meal of our lives!  A truly unique and unequaled experience.  And if you really want to go vegetarian you can here.  Nonetheless, the foie gras and squab are to die for!  I cannot recommend this place enough as it will leave a mark forever in my foody spyche!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,30,They say you can never go back,"Well...such a disappointment! We've been here multiple times in the past twenty years and have driven hours to get to what was once a ""foodie's"" dream. The grounds and the accommodations were still as beautiful as ever. The townspeople were as rude as we remember. The heated pool not so heated. Le café Mère Poule...don't bother. The wait staff was disorganized at best and frankly, as rude as the townspeople. All of this we could tolerate if Michel Guerard's Gourmande restaurant had lived up to it's reputation, but alas, for us it did not. There was no explosion of flavors and it was certainly lacking the beautiful presentation that we remember from past experiences. Maybe we had an off night but we had reserved dinner for two evenings and ended up canceling the second night. The only bright spot of our three days was the Hostess, (Olympia) and the Sommelier at Le Ferme aux Grives. They were so kind and accommodating to our special requests. All in all, not worth the nearly 2300 Euro we paid for the experience."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,outstanding dining experience,"Classical french dining at it's best, do not miss! There were 3 of us dining and we all loved the beautiful and delicious cuisine. Do not miss!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Fabulous,"What an amazing experience!! Simply perfect an experience that will last and lad!    Though I have been before every time seems as wonderful or even better!    He is a genius so incredibly innovative, How he makes dishes that taste simply wonderful using no butter or fat is absolutely incredible.    The stars are well deserved and more if they were alocated.    The hotel the grounds the decor are perfect I can not honestly say much more except if the opportunity ever arises don't miss it!!"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,"Well, you don't get three star from Michelin for no reason...","Fantastic expensive dining experience. If you can't do it every week, do it once... We traveled there, specially to taste Guerard's food, and it was no regrets.... Great crew, fantastic service and memorable food. Life memories."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,40,A Capital of French Cuisine,"Michel Guérard is one of two or three most legendary French chefs still alive today, and deservedly so. His flagship restaurant here in Eugenie-les-Bains, which he inherited from his wife's family in the early 70's and turned into a gastronomic destination, is world-class. The restaurant has held its 3-star-status for nearly 40 years, and the property wears its crown well.    Service here is, unfortunately, entitled and distant. For English-speakers like me, you won't find a ton of sympathy or energy to keep engaging you. If you need something, you have to make eye contact and ask slowly and repeatedly like you're at a DMV.    The food is classically French, and even though Michel was the inventor of an entire style of leaner fare called Cuisine Minceur, not much of that light touch was on display the evening I dined there. Lots of heavy creams, sauces, and soups dominate the plates. A full course-by-course description is available here: ow.ly/5MwW302cAxu    If you go, I highly recommend the menu called the Terroir Sublime. Not only did the dishes seem better than the full-on ""Enchanted Palace"" menu I ordered, it comes with a pairing of wine made by the proprietors themselves."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,All I hoped for and more,"We had the menu terroir sublime, the palais enchanté as well as 2 menu loulou, basically a ridiculous good value for kids, as they get the same dishes (they can more or less choose 4 out of entrees, mains and desserts).  All dishes were described numerous times before. I can only say, Michel Guerard deserves all the praise he gets for his lifetime achievement. But not only this, he is on top of his game, constantly updating his cuisine and keeping it timeless. He was there for lunch, giving clear orders to his staff and looking for perfection. I felt like having discovered the heart of French nouvelle cuisine and therefore of all fine dining.  It was in honor to experience his food, which is the spiritual inspiration for many Paris starred restaurants (just more affordable) and around the globe.  Needless to say, that the setting, service and everything else is flawless.  I would have liked corresponding wines (the menu Sublime came with the very good ""house"" wine of the Guerards) but a half bottle of Pierre Gonon was a good companion.  This lunch gave me the reference point for many dishes.  Hope to have a chance to return."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Memories are made of this,For true Michelin greatness this offers glorious food and exceptional service...the food is seasonal and the menus change accordingly. Best of all the 82 year old chef is in the kitchen

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,As great as French cuisine can be,"Came for one meal. Had the set meal for €195 expensive but worth it for a special occasion. Memorable dishes eg the crab and grapefruit, the salmon en papillotte the Roquefort soufflés. No wines by the glass or seemingly a flight of wines but some half bottles available. Light, flavoursome food as good as any 3star food anywhere. Worth a visit definitely but save up first."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,so amazing I cried,Beyond what I could imagine! The food was so delicate and flavorful. The presentation outstanding and the service beyond expectation. I became teary eyed when the service began and when the beautiful dessert came I teared up again realizing I was indeed experiencing something special.

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Just very good,"Although I'm not reviewing the hotel we did stay and it's very laid back, smart and comfortable with unfussy grounds with a few 'bling' public rooms to satisfy those who like them.  We chose the 235€ menu - dear by my standards but not by most 3 star cards.  Advice was good although I had to take the wine down a notch or two. Its always difficult to match a red with both meat and fish without pushing up into the luxury pinots.  Starting with Tsarina egg (egg with caviar) - what's not to like? What propelled this was a glass of absolutely ice cold armangac straight from the still (i.e. a sort of slightly flavoured vodka very young and no wood). Flavoured just enough to produce a wow.  We followed with blinis with truffles and my partner had a soft pillow of morels in a truffle sauce. Both were quite lovely.  A half lobster served with a soft onion sauce was one of the best I'd tasted - but then I'm not a lobster fan.  I had the wood fired beef (yes it was like eating ice cream in its tenderness) and my partner had hay fired sea bass. This simply showed what sea bass can taste like when its cooked as it should be and its not farmed.  I guess what I'm trying to convey is that everything was exemplary - the quality of everything was of the very highest order - the provenance was there.  Will I remember it forever. Yes it was expensive and it was just very, very good but it wasn't the 'blow your head off' experience I had hoped for.  If anyone reads this they'll probably think...er yes? I guess I'm saying it was almost too perfect - too effortless - too professional. Not doing this very well am I? Should you go  ? If you've got the dosh yes and what's nice is no one would ever say ""oh it was too posh"" or ""it made us feel uneasy"". They're to good for that"

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,The best.,To say it in one word.The Best for me by far.If there was 4 Michelin stars to give then I'll gave it.

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,10,Terrible - ruined our anniversary,"Dreadful service, detached staff, wine glasses full of sediment. Poor technical expertise in the kitchen. My wife and daughter were ill for two days after the meal. Worst of all the general manager was dismissive of our concerns and wrote me a totally inadequate email and has since ignored me. I understand that others had a good experience which leads me to believe that the kitchen is not consistent. M. Gerrard couldn't even be bothered to come out of his office and meet us! Says something about their philosophy."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Raspberry souffle`...,"The tasting menu is more than you need to enjoy the experience, but don't miss it! Start your evening in the lounge...relax, it's a vacation."

Les Pres d'Eugenie - Restaurant Michel Guérard,50,Superb,Our two week gastronomic tour of France and Spain was topped off with this lovely restaurant. Hard to fault any aspect except unfathomably no wines by the glass.

Le Cinq,50,This place deserves every award/star received. One of the best dining experiences in a long time.,"I was expecting to be underwhelmed for overpriced food, but was pleasantly surprised.  This place exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff is well trained and precise in their service. Food was exceptional. Over all experince was a 10/5. I don’t think I can remember the last time I enjoyed such an exceptional meal. Presentation, food, tastes, service, ambience, value etc were all incredible. Would recommend."

Le Cinq,50,A lifetime experience.,"We had an excellent dinner! The chef is a genius. His interpretation and handling of the high quality products is noticeable. The meal is expensive, however, it is extremely value for money. The generosity of the food and staff is big. Besides, the friendliness of the staff and their courtesy are the best. We would like to recommend this establishment."

Le Cinq,50,best of the best,"Simply put, the finest restaurant in the world. its like a beautiful ballet, a symphony if you will, and my wife and i just sat back and watched. how good was it? i almost wept at the end....because i didnt want it to end. one must have dish, is the spaghetti gratin, maybe the best pasta dish i have ever had. cozy beautiful dining room, over the top service, and fantastic food. you must go there at lease once in your life, it was worth every penny"

Le Cinq,50,Romantic Experience in Paris,"Everything was phenomenal and exemplary! The standout was the service, in particular Mr Franck Painchaud (restaurant assistant manager). He made the evening so romantic for us. He took a romantic photo of my wife and I holding hands, and slipped me a white rose to give to her while distracting her with a special birthday dessert. He said, I will make you look good - and he did. Michelin 3 stars service can be very formal, but the staff here were at times humorous and really put their patrons at ease. Oh, the food - Perfection! Beautiful and tasted amazing. We went with the A La Carte menu so we could try their signature ham and truffle spaghetti gratin - a must try dish. Also wonderful were the spider crab and prawn entrees, and the principle dishes of sea bass and salmon. So colorful and artfully presented. The dessert of wild strawberry with meringue, sake and yogurt was the perfect ending. Of course, the amuse bouches and chocolate trolley at the end of the meal were fantastic. When in Paris, this is the restaurant to have a romantic experience. Highly recommend that you consider Le Cinq for the food, the people and the ambiance. Stellar!"

Le Cinq,50,Unmatched service by Mr . Frank .,Unforgettable excellent service by Mr . Frank such a gentleman. Had a girls dinner and this gentleman took very good care of us explaining each course in detail gave us roses . Service unmatched . A restaurant I recommend if you love a luxury dining experience with value for money will definitely Return .thank you to the entire restaurant team you were so kind and a special Thank you to Mr Frank .

Le Cinq,20,How is this a 3 Michelin star restaurant??,"Having dined at Michelin restaurants around the world, it is safe to say that Le Cinq was not only the worst Michelin experience but also one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. While the room is lovely and the wine list is extensive, that is where it all ends. The food was just bad. All of our dishes had too much sauce and all of the hot dishes were served either at room temperature or were cold. The proteins were covered in so much sauce that you could not discern what you were eating. If the level of the ingredients is so high, why not let the meat or seafood shine on its own? The service was also well below even a one Michelin star standard. There were massive gaps in the service throughout the evening and once our mains were served, not a single person asked if we were enjoying the food. It was not until we sent back our food that a bit of attention was focused on our table. Shortly after that, our main waiter disappeared and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get the check. I could go on and on about the shortcomings…. Do yourself a favor and skip Le Cinq. It is simply not up to any Michelin standard and is resting on its laurels."

Le Cinq,50,It is a must!!,"Unforgettable experience!  Le Cinq dining area is very comfortable, very beautiful decorated and elegant!  From the starter dish until the desert was so flavorful yet beautifully presented, truly plating !  Combinations of flavors brought amazing taste to the palette, simply brilliant works of the Chef!  Five star for the sommelier and the service team! Everyone is very attentive and pleasant.  Serving and explaining every dish clearly and elegantly !  I and my partner was amazed by how everything moves efficiently yet harmoniously!  The director of the restaurant Mr Beaumard such a pleasant gentleman, he came to our table a few times to make sure that everything is going smoothly, truly a five star service, Thank you !    Dining at LE CINQ Paris has set our gastronomy experience bar high up.  Well deserved Three star Michelin !"

Le Cinq,40,Pricey but excellent food.,Excellent food. Rapid efficient yet friendly service. Beautiful decor set within the grand four seasons hotel. Creative menu but extremely pricey.

Le Cinq,50,Very good as one would expect,Very good as one would expect. We celebrated meeting up in Paris for the first time post pandemic. Well worth the wait. Le Cinq is one of 3 Michelin* restaurants at the George V. Le Cinq blessed with 3*. Great to enjoy all of them whilst staying here. Look out for quail + tonic water. Very good.

Le Cinq,50,Faultless In Every Way,"Restaurant Le Cinq is without a doubt one of the finest restaurants on Earth and must be visited by anyone in Paris looking for the best of the best from a restaurant.    The dining room is large and grand, set within the beautiful Hôtel George V. When a pianist is playing in the gallery next to the restaurant you can hear this as you dine, which makes for a very comfortable and enjoyable experience.    We started off with some canapés, the parmesan waffle being such a comforting thing with abundance of cheese flavour.    The bread then came which was a selection of baguette, olive bread and a bread with seeds which was almost pastry like, similar to a croissant for example. These were impeccable and served with great butter, I can’t recall having better bread anywhere than this.    All the dishes which followed were equally as impeccable as the bread we started with. I ate a gnocchi which melt in the mouth, the best I’ve had anywhere. The gratinated onions burst in the mouth to reveal a depth of flavour. The spaghetti timbale gratin was as decadent as can be, beautiful mushroom and truffle flavour and even topped with gold leaf. Cheese trolley was perfect. The desserts were all first class and the dessert trolley and the kouign-amann at the end of the meal with coffee was also fantastic.    Service was as attentive I’ve encountered anywhere, yet discreet at the same time. Everyone was extremely friendly and talkative towards us. I’d like to mention a gentleman who previously worked in Oxford that made our evening extra special. The service is akin to a fine Swiss watch, everything runs so smoothly and perfectly.    It is also worth noting that Le Cinq caters to vegetarians perfectly, so do please dine here if you don’t eat meat as you are guaranteed to eat one of the finest meals of your life.    I cannot wait to return and I recommend Le Cinq to anyone who wishes to dine in what I think is easily one of the best of the best restaurants on earth. Christian Le Squer and his chefs in the kitchen are a dream team.    A must visit!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Culinary Treasure,"Priceless experience, full of unique culinary treasure. As part of our stay in Courchevel, we were looking for an intimate evening to indulge ourselves. Le 1947 is the best culinary experience we had un such a long time! The service is just fantastic. All staff pay close attention to details so we did not have to ask for anything, all this while respecting our privacy. The decor is contemporary and charming, and created an appreciated contrast with the showing weather outside. Then came the dishes, one after another and we just could not get enough. The products used are of such great quality and the flavors combines by Chef Yannick Alleno’s cuisine allowed us to reach complete ecstasy. This was the best indulgence we could have asked for. Thanks to all the team and to you Chef. Very much looking forward to coming back."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,10,All of us had food poisoning and ruined our last day of ski,"To rich, to creamy, to much truffle. Genuinely horrible, don’t go there. They think that’s it s a good restaurant but it s just bad."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,30,"Too creamy, too rich. Go dine at La Bouitte","We picked the Tasting Menu for dinner. Started strong with the scallop and pike brioche. The problem starts with the main course as by then we realised that the sauce used were equally rich and heavy as the starters and it was getting harder to enjoy the meal as we felt bloated. By then we could no longer differentiate the sauces as all were heavy to our stomachs. When we thought we would get reprieve in the dessert (we expected something light and refreshing), the base used was chocolate cream. However, good and attentive service. If you are into food, suggest you skip this and go dine at La Bouitte."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,20,Very Disappointed! Will never go back,"Disappointing dinner. Too much butter and oil, very small portion and bad taste.  Overpriced and will never go back.  Nothing in common with the much better Montecarlo hotel hermitage version."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,EXQUISITE AS ALWAYS,"Visited end December for Xmas eve - wonderful, wonderful meal, superb service, wonderful food and wine - great personal.    We were excited to go back and we are excited at the thought of returning for a 3rd time    CP & CP FAMILY"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Classy and Innovative Restaurant,"Excellent restaurant, deserving of its 3 Michelin stars    Le 1947 offers a uniquely innovative approach to cooking, combining excellent modern cooking techniques with locally sourced produce    We had the tasting menu which was a lot of food but well spaced over close to 4 hours. The menu itself began with a series of small courses/nibbles (6 courses of these).    This was followed by 2 starters, 2 main courses, a cheese course and 3 desserts. Too much to go through in detail but highlights were the walk through the woods starter which used a series of locally foraged ingredients, a Japanese beef main course, and a pear dessert which had been preserved for three months.    Service was seamless; professional but friendly - as you would expect from a restaurant of this level.    We will return."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,SUMPTUOUS......... ROCKET MAN !,"Visited end of December and we were lucky to get a reservation at this truly excellent restaurant located in the Cheval Blanc Hotel ( reviewed separately)    There are 5 tables and you are welcomed by Chef Yannick Alenno when you arrive who also explains to you the dishes you will eat and who also helps serve; a most pleasant and humorous person.    Chef Alenno takes you on a inter-galactical food voyage, visiting culinary planets where your taste buds have never been before .... a real culinary rocket man !    Its a marvelous experience in a calm, somewhat ""futuristic"" setting; you will finish your meal with stars in your eyes....    Book quickly !    CP & CP family"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Fantastic,"Very very good restaurante !!! We loved!!! It’s the second time!!! The. First they have 2 star this time they have 3 star!!! Amazing restaurants, the food, staff... evething !!!  We return !!!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Nice,"The Chef Greeted us and gave us a tour to his kitchen which is open to the dining area, which was nice.  The staff service is orchestrated in a way that you feel they are dancing for you with the plates.  The experience most of all, this is what is about. An amazing experience was fantastic. And the food art.  We ended the night with brioche!!!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Experience,"It is a place where go not only to eat but to have a different lovely experience, so modern, chef and staff are so friendly, food it totally different, i like most of it, i ordered the lobster it is presented in 3 different way of cooking..my only note, it is super expensive, bill was 770€ for two. So put this in your mind..."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Go for the New Year's Eve Dinner Party,"I enjoyed and highly recommend the New Year's Eve Dinner Party, the buffet, the unlimited and endless seafoods, caviar, dessert tables, spectacular artistry, immense floats like a carnival parade. Giant ice sculptures. Paparazzi for top couples photos. They had DJ and live entertainment. Fabulous time. Around 1800 EUR for couple."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,20,"Too clever, tried to be different for the sake of been different and incredible expensive","We ate there with 2 other couples who all thought the same,  The dining area is very cool with only 5 tables, the staff are super attentive,  To the point we were considerately outnumbered when they served our main course.  As for the meal we would not go back as the food had been played with some much  It took away what the food should be about. We didn't go for the taster menu but ate of the  A la carts menu, lots of mouth teaser were served before our starters were served which  We could not work out what we were eating even after been told. The soup was was very good but the third dimension off licking a stone with a bit of chopped veg on the top was pointless, as for the steak which was good but again the jacket potato which was then a show point of been chopped up with bits did nothing to the dish, once we finished that dish everyone was as to go into the kitchen to watch the second part of the steak dish be prepared, which was a salad been dropped into a large copper bowl the liquid nitrogen poured around buy the head chief with the someone bashing the salad till it shattered into little bits, this was then served over some reduction, on eating it the salad it was so cold it tasted of nothing, my wife ate the fish main which came with rice that she didn't eat because it was foul.  As for the bill it was nearly 800 euro's per couple without going large on the wine.  Box ticked but much tastier places to eat at a fraction of the price.  The night before our friends ate at the Chabichou had a much more enjoyable meal, sorry we chose the wrong night to go out with them  Won't be going back"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Extraordinary!,Sleek interior design and extraordinary culinary delight. Highly recommend tasting menu (and the delightful yuzu souffle).

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,One of a kind,My wife and I spent few days in this beautiful hotel. Right after our arrival we booked a reservation in Le 1947. The place is very calm and has a very good decorative taste. It is rather simple but elegant. The courses started arriving in a prompt manner. Every bite was a unique taste experience. The presentation was outstanding and the magic that create all this together give Le 1947 one of a kind French restaurant. A truly world class

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Excellent,"Excellent , lovely experience with friends . Superb service , excellent food . Fine dining at its best ."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Wonderful,"A true dining experience.    We chose the tasting menu which was superb.    Great food, great service. Beautiful room.    Not Maldivian at all but for one night and the experience, it doesn't matter."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,20,Good food at unreasonably high price,"We ate there as a couple on March 13 2016. We had very high expectation of the restaurant. I cant say that the food wasn't good - it was, but nothing special. the HB at the Annapurna hotel was actually better then 1947. There was nothing in the food that justifies 500 euro for 2 appetizers and 2 main courses. I was very disappointed. I ate at some other 2 Michelin stars restaurants, like steireck in Vienna, which were so much better.  two other comments:  1. if they offer a glass of champagne before dinner, it would be fair to notify it costs 70 Euro.  2. They did send me email asking how was my experience. I did say I was disappointed and wrote why. A month later, and no return email with at least some excuse.  All in All - I do not reccomend, even if money is not an issue.  Amir"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Family moment.,"This restaurant is amazing.    How to describe, only with three words: calm,elegant and magic.    The menu is gorgeous! Thank to all the kitchen for this cosy family moment.    It was a magic diner with my parents.  I recommend this restaurant to any one who want to test new experience.    The restaurant 1947, is not just Michelin restaurant, it's a magic restaurant.    Thank!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Truffle magnificence,"From the moment you enter you are in for a treat of the senses.  This high class extraordinary restaurant is an experience to remember.  An amazing room, amazing service and the food is remarkable in its detail.  If it's a night to remember you want expense not an issue then 1947 will delight you"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Bravo!,"The experience begins by entering the restaurant. I'm a huge fan of architecture and design, and Le 1947 has both. We felt we were in a James Bond movie, it was surreal! Everything white, even the hostess dress! Only 5 tables, very exclusive, an open (and beautiful) kitchen. Service and staff very good and polite, as expected for a 2 Michelin star.  Food was amazing, creative, with beautiful presentation. Specially the main course (my husband and I chose the same dish - Fillet and Chops of Lamb. The best lamb of our lives!!). After dinner, the chef came to our table and we were impressed at how young he looked. He seemed very nice and sweet. A humble expression upon our congratulations.  The restaurant is located inside the beautiful hotel ""Le Cheval Blanc"". We had a drink at the Bar before dinner and they were playing live music, which was worth the while.  A perfect evening indeed!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,One of the best food experience for many years,"What to begin with? ...  The place firstly is amzing and design with just a few table in a kind of time capsule that you could imagine in a James Bond Movie ...  The staff is friendly and welcome you nicely ... and while having a drink youcan talk with the Chef and even visit the open kitchen...  Thirdly the food is amazing and inventive ... and you can even go to the kitchen to see how your dish is dressed!  Maybe the winelist is a bit too expensive but with an amazing choice of ""Cheval Blanc"" wines ...  If you are ready to spend a ot in a restaurant ... it can be the best choice there ..."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Perfect evening,"The decor is modern and interesting.    The food is really good and creative and it was the first time I heard my vegan girlfriend happy about what was offered to her in a French restaurant.    The service is perfect, always there when needed but not overly present and heavy like in some Michelin stared restaurants where you sometimes want to ask them to leave you alone a bit.    We then went to the smoking lounge which is a very well decorated yourt where I could listen to my favourite radio Nova while smoking shisha.    A perfect evening. They definitely deserve their third star."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,remarkable experience,"A total dining experience. Unequaled attention (there are five tables in the restaurant), amazing details in the food and presentation. Pricey, of course. Plan to be there for several hours. Spectacular wine, also of course."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Best lamb ever,"Is undeniable that this is a very expensive restaurant. Having said that, is a worth experience. The service is very attentive, the tasting menu is served is a very good pace and the chef is very present and a nice character. Some dishes in this menu were memorable: the gnocchi of whitefish has a is very surprising form and a superb taste. The lamb was simple the best I have ever had. This particular tasting menu is very rich in truffles, which I am a particular fan. More important, no dish was weak, which is very difficult in a tasting menu. If money is not a concern, a must go."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,No words can do it justice,"I love good food, I love good service.    This restaurant has taken both to new levels.    I literally can't verbalise how good the experience was.    Anyone reading this that appreciates the best of what restaurants can possibly offer you must try this restaurant.    A big thank you to all if the staff there.    Jon and Nickie"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Wow! *,"This was not our first visit to a restaurant at the Cheval Blanc hotel, but it was our first experience at the ""restaurant gastronomic"" which opened last year at this hotel. You walk into the open space architecture of the small restaurant and can not help but appreciate the unique decor. They have two versions of a tasting menu - a short or a full version of ""an experience"". And what an experience it was - a wide variety of small dishes, each beautifully presented and very creative. There is not much to choose from but they would gladly accommodate any dietary restrictions. The only caveat (which is why I have the asterisk in the headline of the review) - you may need to cash a portion of your retirement fund to pay for the meal. Otherwise - an awe inspiring experience!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,A night to remember!,It was a definitely a night to remember. Great food and great attentive staff. Very expensive though!

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Impressive 2 star Michelin experience,"Ate here on Valentine's day, 2013. Exclusive and hip - the restaurant only has 5 tables with an open kitchen, where you are invited to walk in at will and see how the chef prepares your food. Chefs are extremely welcoming and friendly, which adds greatly to the gastronomic experience. Both Maitre'D and head chef was hospitable and international (both had worked extensively in Asia). The staff to guest ratio was almost 1-to-1, which offered a very high level of attention. The restaurant offers 2 menus - a full 20 course tasting menu (400 Euro) or a ""lighter"" menu (300 Euro). We opted for the lighter menu, and were completely full by the 6th course (even before reaching our main course). If you order the full tasting menu, be sure you stay hungry the whole day leading up to your meal. The food is amazing (except for the actual main course which was good but short of amazing). Wine list is extensive, including some incredible Cheval Blanc vintages (pricey).    1947 is located inside the Cheval Blanc hotel, which is very chic, and worth a visit.    If you only have 1 meal in Courchevel, then this is the place to go.    Only downside? Our sommelier managed to spill our wine onto the table (and some onto my wife) while pouring. I'm sure it was an isolated incident and he offered us free desert wine as a result.    If you are staying elsewhere, you can ask Cheval Blanc to send their shuttle to pick you up (and send you home afterwards). Very convenient!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,10,1947 restaurant,"courchevel now has some of the best restaurants in the alps,this is not one of them.  the400 euro per person set dinner was one of lifes great dissapointments.  i have eaten in very many michelin starred restaurants ( including 3 that same weekend)  strato the night before was half the price and one of the best meals i have ever eaten.    dont try it !"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Wonderful,"A true dining experience.    We chose the tasting menu which was superb.    Great food, great service. Beautiful room.    Not Maldivian at all but for one night and the experience, it doesn't matter."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,20,Good food at unreasonably high price,"We ate there as a couple on March 13 2016. We had very high expectation of the restaurant. I cant say that the food wasn't good - it was, but nothing special. the HB at the Annapurna hotel was actually better then 1947. There was nothing in the food that justifies 500 euro for 2 appetizers and 2 main courses. I was very disappointed. I ate at some other 2 Michelin stars restaurants, like steireck in Vienna, which were so much better.  two other comments:  1. if they offer a glass of champagne before dinner, it would be fair to notify it costs 70 Euro.  2. They did send me email asking how was my experience. I did say I was disappointed and wrote why. A month later, and no return email with at least some excuse.  All in All - I do not reccomend, even if money is not an issue.  Amir"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Family moment.,"This restaurant is amazing.    How to describe, only with three words: calm,elegant and magic.    The menu is gorgeous! Thank to all the kitchen for this cosy family moment.    It was a magic diner with my parents.  I recommend this restaurant to any one who want to test new experience.    The restaurant 1947, is not just Michelin restaurant, it's a magic restaurant.    Thank!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Truffle magnificence,"From the moment you enter you are in for a treat of the senses.  This high class extraordinary restaurant is an experience to remember.  An amazing room, amazing service and the food is remarkable in its detail.  If it's a night to remember you want expense not an issue then 1947 will delight you"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Bravo!,"The experience begins by entering the restaurant. I'm a huge fan of architecture and design, and Le 1947 has both. We felt we were in a James Bond movie, it was surreal! Everything white, even the hostess dress! Only 5 tables, very exclusive, an open (and beautiful) kitchen. Service and staff very good and polite, as expected for a 2 Michelin star.  Food was amazing, creative, with beautiful presentation. Specially the main course (my husband and I chose the same dish - Fillet and Chops of Lamb. The best lamb of our lives!!). After dinner, the chef came to our table and we were impressed at how young he looked. He seemed very nice and sweet. A humble expression upon our congratulations.  The restaurant is located inside the beautiful hotel ""Le Cheval Blanc"". We had a drink at the Bar before dinner and they were playing live music, which was worth the while.  A perfect evening indeed!"

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,One of the best food experience for many years,"What to begin with? ...  The place firstly is amzing and design with just a few table in a kind of time capsule that you could imagine in a James Bond Movie ...  The staff is friendly and welcome you nicely ... and while having a drink youcan talk with the Chef and even visit the open kitchen...  Thirdly the food is amazing and inventive ... and you can even go to the kitchen to see how your dish is dressed!  Maybe the winelist is a bit too expensive but with an amazing choice of ""Cheval Blanc"" wines ...  If you are ready to spend a ot in a restaurant ... it can be the best choice there ..."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Perfect evening,"The decor is modern and interesting.    The food is really good and creative and it was the first time I heard my vegan girlfriend happy about what was offered to her in a French restaurant.    The service is perfect, always there when needed but not overly present and heavy like in some Michelin stared restaurants where you sometimes want to ask them to leave you alone a bit.    We then went to the smoking lounge which is a very well decorated yourt where I could listen to my favourite radio Nova while smoking shisha.    A perfect evening. They definitely deserve their third star."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,remarkable experience,"A total dining experience. Unequaled attention (there are five tables in the restaurant), amazing details in the food and presentation. Pricey, of course. Plan to be there for several hours. Spectacular wine, also of course."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,Best lamb ever,"Is undeniable that this is a very expensive restaurant. Having said that, is a worth experience. The service is very attentive, the tasting menu is served is a very good pace and the chef is very present and a nice character. Some dishes in this menu were memorable: the gnocchi of whitefish has a is very surprising form and a superb taste. The lamb was simple the best I have ever had. This particular tasting menu is very rich in truffles, which I am a particular fan. More important, no dish was weak, which is very difficult in a tasting menu. If money is not a concern, a must go."

Le 1947 à Cheval Blanc,50,No words can do it justice,"I love good food, I love good service.    This restaurant has taken both to new levels.    I literally can't verbalise how good the experience was.    Anyone reading this that appreciates the best of what restaurants can possibly offer you must try this restaurant.    A big thank you to all if the staff there.    Jon and Nickie"

Epicure,50,This is peak dining!,"Couldn't come to Paris and go to at least one of the ten three Michelin star restaurants in the city. After doing plenty of research, I opted for Epicure as it looked like the best option. All I can say after coming here is that this is haute cuisine at its absolute finest. Michelin dining has peaked for me!    First things first, it wasn't terribly difficult to book a reservation here, probably because of the fact there are so many three stars in Paris. Obviously I was keeping an eye on when dinner reservations became available, but it was nothing like some of the impossible reservations back home in the U.S. for three stars.    Anyways, the food completely blew me away. The execution and creativity of every dish was on full display. On this particular trip, we had Tomate Ancienne, Large Langoustines, Candele Macaroni, Salmon from Scotland, and Lamb from Alpilles as our main courses. It's hard to really pinpoint what my favorite was because all of the dishes were outstanding. If I had to pick, the Large Langoustines was my favorite because of how perfectly cooked it was. The Candele Macaroni was amazing because of the black truffle mixed with mature Parmesan cheese. Salmon from Scotland was so soft that we didn't even need a knife to cut it. They even used the lamb in two different ways, to create a carpaccio initially and then cook up a roasted saddle of lamb. Oh, and the Tomate Ancienne was somehow frozen inside despite obviously being fresh. The best thing about Epicure is that all these dishes are on their a la carte menu, so if you opted to skip the tasting menu you could still have a lot of these dishes.    Oh, and for that cheese and dessert course at the end? They have so many cheeses on hand, and they offer three...but I'm sure if you requested more you could totally have more. After the main dessert, they offer chocolate and macarons. And if you REALLY wanted it, you could have every single chocolate and macaron they offer. If it wasn't for the fact that we were completely stuffed by the end of the meal, I may have taken them up on that.    Service...well, I have no words. I mean, this is truly the pinnacle of service right? A place like this could make you feel like they are too good for you, but they don't do that here at all as everyone is super welcoming. Epicure has an army of waiters here and they are on it like a machine. Every little detail was attended to. Every request we had was fulfilled, including getting our menus signed and taking a kitchen tour. Even got to talk to the head chef for 10 minutes, which is how I found how they made a jelly out of red peppers and that the salmon was actually cooked in a sous vide. Hell, you couldn't even go to the bathroom without someone walking you there. I have been spoiled for service at fine dining establishments, but Epicure is on a level on its own.    Ambience is pretty amazing. Even though the inside dining room looked amazing, we decided on sitting outside considering it was a nice summer night with a very late sunset. The garden area is a great place to have a nice dinner! Bathed in evening light. Even when it got darker, the lighting was perfect to keep the right atmosphere.    There's three stars, and then there's three stars in Paris. A truly wondrous experience and unquestionably the best dinner I have ever had. Best part is that they do have an a la carte menu, so I can still come back and opt for something cheaper. Absolutely love Epicure!"

Epicure,50,Truly wonderful,"I wasn't going to write a review as I couldn't think of any more superlatives to describe the food, ambience and service that hasn't already been used in previous reviews but I just had to write one. We had the tasting menu and it was delicious. The Scottish salmon , like all the courses, was amazing. The service was impeccable and the ambience was perfect. Worth every euro !"

Epicure,50,Memorable Celebration!,"I have been dining here for over 21 years now and have never had a bad course let alone a bad meal nor a bad or ill judged moment of service.    At my most recent trip ( a celebratory lunch for eight people) the dining room and surrounding gardens looked spit spot in the summer sunshine as did the cat walk aesthetic staff .    After an array of amuse bouche that delighted both eye and palate WITHOUT blunting appetite, we started in earnest with perfectly sourced and sauced Scottish Langoustines. They were perfectly cooked - not sashimi raw nor oven dish rubberised , just set, unctuous and sweet.    A delicate sauce perfumed with a little Eastern spice and a hint of mango served to highlight the beauteousness of the crustaceans.    Everyone at the table had poulet de bresse en vessie- which delighted, impressed and nurtured the entire party.  Served in the traditional way of two services with a cream sauce napped over the breast followed by a bouillon made of the legs    Dessert involved fraises des bois and a parade of petit fours rounded things off.    Flawless service , warm , friendly and professional.    All Just SUPERB.    Thank You Epicure !    Mubariz Hussain    Sent from my iPhone"

Epicure,30,"Food Good, Value Proposition and Service Need Improvement","We have been at the Epicure about half a dozen times over the past decade. Our visit this year will probably bring this series to an end.    It is not that the dishes are no longer good. By and large, they still are—though for the first time, we found something to be unhappy with: the chef’s newfound penchant for curry. In our view, this ruined the blue lobster, the old recipe was better. In general, curry flavor is not what I would want in haute cuisine; if I want good curry, I’ll go to an Indian restaurant.    The real issues are two: value proposition and customer care.    In terms of value, relative to what is being delivered, the prices are no longer reasonable. With two courses (starter, main) and a glass of wine with each course, plus water and a coffee in the end, the bill came to almost 400 euros per person. Yes, I know, inflation and all that, but still. Part of the issue is that there are no more set menus other than the tasting menu, which is just a tad much for lunch.    In terms of customer care, we found it amazing that every single time we go to Epicure, we are treated like new customers. Every time it is a blank slate—oh, you have dined with us before? If main street hotel chains like Marriott can keep track of preferences like foam pillows and high floors, surely the restaurant crown jewel in the Oetker Collection can keep track of past customers (with their approval, obviously)? How much more welcoming would it be to hear something like, “Welcome back, Mr. and Ms. X! We have your favorite outside table ready for you. Last time you enjoyed Y, can I recommend Z?”"

Epicure,50,3* Michelin in paris,An amazing 3* restaurant in le Bristol - Paris. Beautiful dining room but also a lovely terrace to have your exquisite dinner outside or to have your glass of champagne. Food and service is just sublime.

Epicure,50,So Worth it!,"From the moment Epicure opened its doors, you are treated with high hospitality In a most elegant setting. The entire team does an amazing job of caring for each group of guests, intuitively understanding how much interaction and conversation is desired. The chef took my wife’s allergies as a challenge and made adjustments that not only removed dairy from her menu bipartisanship but also thrilled her taste buds. He even adjusted the order of her tasting to better suit the taste of the changes he had to make. They do not have a traditional wine pairing and still offered an amazing selection of wine that was amazing. We highly recommend explaining your tastes to the sommelier and trust them to pick the wines that work best with your meal. 3 wines, plus a champagne and every glass was on point. Every dish in the tasting menu was superb and displayed beautifully. Everything on the plate makes sense and falls in line with the chef’s vision. The restaurant displays the difference between choreography and orchestration of a meal. Everyone is trained so well they only need to show up at the table and anyone nearby knows to assist and make it happen without any visual or verbal cues - orchestration. Amazing food, amazing staff, amazing orchestration makes for a 3 star amazing experience. Highly recommended. Caviar, mushrooms, artichokes, lobster, salmon, sweetbreads, cheeses, desserts, chocolates and more…. As my wife said, “Holy sh!t! This is good!”"

Epicure,50,Great experience,"I never spent so much money on food (nor have I had such a long dinner before), but the whole experience was definitely worth a try. Food was good, wine was amazing, and service was extraordianry! Made me feel like a queen :)"

Epicure,50,Superb,"There's really nothing to add to the uniformly excellent reviews except to say that they are correct. Stunning food and some of the best and most welcoming service in Paris. It's very expensive but well worth saving up for. Stop having second-rate tasting menus in American restaurants and have the real thing here instead. You won't want to eat out again for a month after you return home because the memory of what good food can be will stay with you. If you're a couple, book a table by the windows."

Epicure,50,Perfection What More Can You Say,Just experienced dinner at this sumptuous gastronomical delight. First the room is absolutely beautiful. We arrived for a special occasion and were shown to a small badly located table. After suggesting a change in location which was granted the evening became magical. The waitstaff has their act together as does the kitchen. Everyone is treated like a special guest. Friendly and knowledgeable is the way to describe how they respond to their diners. The prices as expected are in the stratosphere but one would pay anything for this experience.

Epicure,50,Can't wait to go again!,"The food was seriously amazing! The atmosphere of the restaurant is so elegant and welcoming, and the service is truly top-notch. The entire dining experience was unforgettable and definitely one for the books! I highly recommend Epicure to anyone looking for an incredible meal in Paris. Trust me, you won't regret it!"

Epicure,40,Great moment in a great place,"Great moment in a beautiful atmosphere,  Nice menu  Loved the sea food side of the menu with amazing langoustine cooked perfectly same as the dover sole  Chews trolley was incredible and so tasty  Huge deception on the desserts :  Raspberry was boring, the vanilla was missing lot of textures, only creamy feeling in it  But chocolate and macaroons came after was really good  Would be nice to create couple of paring wine menus for tasting menu"

Epicure,30,Found a piece of hair,"Found a piece of gray hair baked into their house made bread during the cheese course. I discovered it as I was about to bite into the piece. I showed the piece to one of the waitstaff. He didn’t even apologize or acknowledged; only thing he did was take the left over bread and bring out a new loaf of bread. By that time, I was grossed out by it, so I stopped eating the rest of the cheeses. This is a 3 Michelin star restaurant. I go out to fine dining often, it is a shame to see the lack of of cleanness but also no apology or acknowledgment from the staff regarding finding hair in the food. Additionally, an older, lead waitstaff sort of made fun of a newer, younger black waitstaff in front of us. We felt so uncomfortable that we began to defend him for making rude comments in front of us. It’s extremely unprofessional for the lead to be little a new employee in front of customers. I’d expect more from this caliber of the restaurant; not sure if I’d recommend this place as there are plenty of Michelin star restaurants in Paris Other than that, great food and good service."

Epicure,50,Epicure,"Epicure is the 3-Star restaurant housed in the elegant Hotel Bristol. We were treated in an incredible act of generosity by good American friends. We ordered a la carte; a parade of preliminary tastes, breads, palate teasers. My entrée, 3 wide pieces of large macaroni filled with foie gras and truffles. My plat, chicken for 2 served in two courses cooked in a pig’s bladder and carved tableside. You had to be there!    Other dishes equally elaborate. All beautiful to look at, to smell and to taste. A large (and full) room. Elegant settings. Responsive, practiced service, but with a friendly, light touch. Pre and post desserts with an ethereal chocolate preparation my dessert choice.    A wonderful, near-matchless experience with wines I can only imagine the price.    It is theater, and if food is not your thing, it is silly to even consider it. But it is a 3-Star experience available only to a few. You won’t find it outside of Paris."

Epicure,50,Perfect!!,"We had the most amazing dinner at Epicure at the end of a long weekend in Paris with our friends. Every dish on our tasting menu was sublime, from the amuse, to the bread made with their own wheat, and all the way through to the second dessert, with many standouts in between. One person in our group is diabetic and has challenging dietary restrictions, and the restaurant embraced the opportunity to craft her a separate tasting menu that was equally amazing. Our sommelier picked a series of perfect wines to match our meal, and clearly enjoyed doing so. As good as the food was (and it was impeccable), the service from the entire team was if anything even better — attentive, patient, good humored, witty, and fun. It was a truly memorable evening, and I can’t wait to get back to try all the dishes we missed this time!!"

Epicure,50,From a place we avoided to the most delightful experience,"We tried this restaurant many many years ago and didn’t have a good experience. So we had been avoiding it . We decided to give it a second chance and we are glad we did.    The service is absolutely outstanding this time. Servers are polite, efficient and friendly. Food was excellent. Before this meal, we ate at 2 other 3 Michelin starred restaurants and this turned out to be the best meal. We wanted to try the Bresse chicken but it’s for 2 people. Normally we don’t order chicken in a fancy restaurant but the Bresse chicken is in a class of its own. We gave up our favorites such as blue lobster and scallops to have this. Not willing to give up the scallops with white truffles, we asked if we can have the scallops( which is a main dish) split into 2 portions and we will have it as appetizer. They were flexible enough to accommodate.  The Bresse chicken was presented in an impressive shower and it is moist and tender. The sauce that accompanied the white meat was to die for. The legs were served separately as a separate dish, with crispy skin.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the white truffle was shaved in front of us and it’s a rather generous serving.  Highly recommend this restaurant. Everything from complimentary amuse bouches to desserts are delicate, creative and tasty."

Epicure,50,Best restaurant in the world,"Best restaurant I have ever been to in my life, The experience was truly unforgettable and I will enjoy the memories for a life time. The food, The service, Everything is just amazing. I know it’s super expensive but for a special occasion it’s really worth it, Believe me.. you won’t regret it and you will still talk about it after many years, It’s not just a dinner.. It’s an experience. Also big thank you to the staff who were outstanding and super professional. We took the menu and it was just WOW."

Epicure,50,Worth a visit,"Worth the hypes and the price. Every dish was executed to perfection and very creative. The service was like an orchestra. We got greeted from the front door of the hotel and well taken care of until we left 3 hrs later. We also got to meet the chef in the kitchen and had a photo with him. If there is a criticism: the service was very professional and attentive, but I personally found it lacking genuity with some of the staff (there were a whole team, and obviously not all of them behaved the same)."

Epicure,50,Impeccable food and service,"Epicure is my favorite 3 star Michelin restaurant so far. I did the lunch tasting menu and my partner did the vegetarian tasting menu. I read reviews about the vegetarian options beforehand and I was worried it would be a less cohesive menu with fewer courses. That was definitely not the case.    The food was delicious and beautifully plated. Textures and tastes were absolutely perfect.    The service almost out shined the food. Really, the service is at par with the food but phrasing it that way doesn't feel like I'm giving the staff the accolades they deserve.  In the beginning, the service is what you'd expect from a 3 star: attentive staff with impeccable presentations of each dish. What shortly revealed itself was the warm and humorous personalities of the individuals. How they interacted with me and other guests cleared the air of any pretentiousness which allowed me to enjoy my time more.    Epicure is one of the few Michelin 3 stars I'd go back to."

Epicure,50,A true Michelin 3 stars,Very nice experience. They really deserves 3 Michelin stars. The food is very well prepared and presented. Great wine list. Great service. Highly recommended.

Epicure,50,Utterly amazing.,"Fine dining at its absolute best. The tasting menu was divine.  Mashed potato topped with caviar was amazing. The beautiful langoustine, slow cooked salmon with a hint of spice    Please don't be put off by chicken cooked in a bladder - it looks like a big balloon and tastes wonderful.    It was of course, very expensive and a complete treat. But worth every penny."

Epicure,50,A true Michelin Three,"Maticulous service, perfectly prepared crudités, elegant setting, and great wine pairing. It brings French food to one of the peak level. Hard to find reservation, but totally worth the effort."

Epicure,50,Must go!,Outstanding food! I highly recommend the tasting menu for the best options of the menu. It is traditional French food but the flavours are rich and delicious. The service was impeccable and catered to our every need.

Epicure,50,Perfect 12th wedding anniversary,"My husband and I celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary at Epicure.    On the night, we were first guests to arrive and chose a garden view table.  The host was very gracious and made sure we promptly received our menus and wine recommendations.    We went for the tasting menu accompanied by a glass of champagne, then Sancerre and finished with a lovely Riesling.    We asked to swap one of the dishes and they not only swapped it but also printed a new, personalised menu which was a nice touch.    The food was fantastic, our favourite dishes included caviar from sologne, langoustine with mango and macaroni with black truffle. Farm hen poached in a bladder was a perfect main course.    Service was very good and the timing of each dish meant we had time to enjoy quiet time between food.    It was a perfect place to celebrate our wedding anniversary."

Epicure,50,5 stars plus a vacation of utter luxuty,"Arrival immediate room allocation and staff on reception multi-lingual. The rooms were impecable. We arrived for a 2 night stay for a special occasion and that is exactly what we received. Every single member of staff are professional.  A highly romantic dinner with the white tablecloths, an extra touch is the changing of napkins for the desserts.  the food - exquisite- Elegant dining room for refined cuisine and an extensive list of wines to enhance the romantic evening. Dinner cost E390 including the wine which is a bit over the top but that is what you expect when you visit a restaurant of this quality. my favourite: black truffles featuring faux pasta made of onion served in a hollowed-out onion; Out of this world ! The selection of cheeses are endless.    A special call out to Eric the chef: magnifico Eric"

Epicure,50,"Exceptional, as always.","I've had the pleasure at dining at Epicure many times over the last ten years, having been fortunate to have stayed at Le Bristol on 15-20 occasions.    As for this visit, as always the service was excellent. Having contacted the restaurant prior, they happily created a tasting menu customised to my dietary and allergy requirements. The food was exceptional, so much so I dined twice during my four night stay - with the second tasting menu being every bit as good as the first."

Epicure,50,Nice place to be..,"We had a great services to this place and real had a great time here, the food it self was out standing and very delicious. Highly recommended"

Epicure,50,Theatre!,"Epicure is a 3 Michelin Star restaurant and it is well deserved. It may not be the most cutting edge but it is outstanding for those who enjoy modern French without compromising integrity. The dining room is located in Le Bristol and it is grand and formal. In the summer and on a nice day, there is an opportunity to dine outside in the garden which makes it unusual.    All the dishes were of the highest standard - best ingredients, thoughtful flavouring, well balanced acidity with structure and beautifully presented. The highlight for me was the caviar on potato puree and the desert (vanilla from Madagascar) were astounding dishes. The wine list was well thought providing diners with a range of options that will not break the bank.    But the lasting memory of Epicure was the quality of service. Full of theatre but from staff who cared and knew their food and wine."

Epicure,50,Perfect,"We had high expectations and they were met!  We ordered the chef’s signature dishes menu and everything was perfect.  The service was also great, attentive, efficient, accommodating.  Can’t wait to go back when in Paris again."

Epicure,50,I must return!,Unfortunately my fairest day and half in Paris i wasn’t feeling well so I missed out on the best experience Epicure had to offer. Ryne on the3 other hand enjoyed 100%. My stomach was upset and each time I left a bit of food on my plate the servers asked if everything was ok or if something was wrong wit the dish. Ultimately I pulled one aside to let them know that I wasn’t feeling well and could they bring me smaller portions so I could at least taste even if I wasn’t able to finish completely. they accommodated this and it made the rest of the meal smoother. Service was excellent and thank you to Arona and also to the Irish trainee who was excellent but I can’t recall how to spell his name - maybe started with an O.

Eleven Madison Park,50,Amazing experience,"We had an amazing time here. The food was excellent but it was made extra special by all the staff - not only was the service great, there were lots of little extra personal touches that really made it a memorable and unique experience."

Eleven Madison Park,20,The worst service ever!,"This was our second time at EMP and I was very surprised we weren’t welcomed as returning guest…very disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber. From the time we stepped into the restaurant and was led to our table, the mood was off and things didn’t quite feel right. . From beginning to end the service was horrible! It literally took 30 minutes for us to get our first glass of wine. We felt it was way too much unnecessary time spent between meals. So much that we kind of thought they forgot about us. Our water glasses were empty for most of the evening, with only two refills. I decided to request a cocktail and the waiter made a great suggestion, however, I believe he forgot to order my drink, so after 20 minutes I decided to ask another waiter for my cocktail. The original waiter finally returned with my cocktail and was clearly upset and proceeded to ignored us for the rest of the evening, which we found to be extremely rude. Additionally, several of the dishes were a repeat from our original visit in April. We felt the service was extremely poor, however, meeting the chef again was a nice touch, but not enough to make me want to frequent EMP again. Please note customer service is everything and I believed EMP missed the mark."

Eleven Madison Park,10,Big deception - Would not recommend to spend USD 1500 for 2 persons,"The dinner was a great deception. From a *** Michelin restaurant I expect much more. The dessert was a disaster and we told them so. In terms of atmosphere, the seats are great but the music far too loud, aggressive, and not aligned with vegan philosophy."

Eleven Madison Park,50,The Crown Jewel of New York,"It's easy to see why this place has frequently been voted best restaurant in the world. We book a reservation well in advance of our visits to New York, and we are never disappointed.    Owned by world-renowned chef Daniel Humm, this jewel of Manhattan features a gorgeous Art Deco ambience, and the menu offers some of the finest and most creative and decadently delicious takes on plant-based versions of various foods.    At $365 for a 8-to-10 course tasting, it truly is an amazing deal, as food this great should actually cost far more. We never cease to be amazed at what this innovative kitchen concocts, and we will always return.    Thank you, EMP."

Eleven Madison Park,50,culinary masterpiece in New York,"Dining at Eleven Madison Park in New York was a culinary journey like no other. The restaurant’s commitment to innovation and excellence was evident in every dish. The tasting menu was a symphony of flavors, with each course beautifully presented and thoughtfully crafted. The staff’s knowledge and impeccable service added to the overall experience. The restaurant’s elegant Art Deco setting and views of Madison Square Park created a memorable atmosphere. Eleven Madison Park is not just a restaurant; it’s a gastronomic masterpiece that I would recommend to anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience in New York."

Eleven Madison Park,40,Oh the intrigue...,"I've heard so much about this place that by the time I got to experience it, my expectations driven by the restaurant's reputation and stories from the EMP loyalists were sky-high...    All in all, it was an enjoyable evening, and definitely a highly memorable birthday dinner for the books. The team does know how to delight and surprise its guests, in some cases going above and beyond to deliver. In this case, they delivered a lovely celebration, complete with a friendly intervention from the West Coast (some ninja-level coordination moves were involved, as it turned out).    As for the food, we went with a shorter version of the menu, which was just the right amount of food for the picky eaters with moderate appetites present at the table. That said, I would probably recommend going for the full menu otherwise. Despite the fact that the menu is all plant-based and we opted for just 6 courses, we did not feel hungry at all (quite on the contrary). Some of the items were a bigger hit at our table than others (we both loved the tomato ""chapter"" whereas the sunflower course was a bit out of my party's comfort zone and seemed a bit bland to me too.    The service here as you'd expect is exceptional. They are there when you need them, they are pretty much invisible - when you don't. That said, you feel well taken care of. It was not impeccable, alas - I am a stickler for details, and here some were missed. CPH's Alchemist still holds the ""impeccable"" spot for me personally. But the experience was very, very good.    It was a bummer we did not get to experience a tour of the kitchen, maybe next time. I think the fact that my lovely teenager brought a Sonny Angel toy to a dinner at EMP could've marked us as ineligible for an add-on of this kind. Oh well, at least it produced laughs and giggles from the staff :)    Definitely a worthy choice for a special celebration, an elegant date night, or just as a way to spoil yourself."

Eleven Madison Park,30,"In my view not ""worthy of a special journey"" as described in Guide Michelin.","Ok, I'm mixed. EMP has been on my list for years. Didn't go before their switch to vegan, or when the tip was included. But even with those changes, I wanted to try. Bottom line for me: Not worth the 3 Michelin stars in my view. According to the Michelin guide the 3 stars are ""Exceptional cuisine worthy of a special journey."" For me that's not the case. While the food was good (well, as good as vegan can be), there was nothing for myself or my wife that was worthy of a special journey to NYC. We didn't dislike anything, but we really weren't wow'ed by anything either. According to the Michelin guide service for stars and price really aren't part of the rating -- just the food on the plate. However, the reason I dine out is quality, service, and value. That said, the 3 Michelin stars here did not hit my mark for quality or value. The one standout however was the service. It was impeccable from my experience. Although we were never offered a kitchen tour like several of the groups around us (I didn't ask for one though), there were no missteps in the service. This is why I rated the TripAdvisor 3 rating here. If it wasn't for the service, I would consider this a poor overall restaurant experience (based on value). EMP also changed their tipping policy from no tipping needed because originally, they said they pay their staff appropriately, to a now, well, yeah, we obviously don't pay our staff and we need to get you to tip to subsidize our wages to our staff. When you combine that policy with a vegan menu that was just ok in my opinion to the high prices they are charging... well, it just doesn't hit my value proposition well. Obviously, others may feel differently."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Absolutely amazing!,Can’t say enough great things about this place! Everything is absolutely delicious and the vibe is incredible! Highly recommended!

Eleven Madison Park,40,"Very good, but not a 3 stars michelin","Former number 1 of the best restaurants and after seeing the documentary about their reopening, we decided to try this restaurant. I should have read the reviews online before about going vegan, let's just say my expectations were lowered. We took the bar tasting menu (6 courses). The first thing you notice is the beauty of the place. We see that there has been a lot of investment. We started with signature drinks. All were very good, especially the tequila and Mezcal one. For the tasting menu, a favorite for the tomato infusion glass, the sunflower dish was also excellent. Whether it was the eggplant or the zucchini, it was tasty and very well presented. The problem is in the portions, the tomato dish is made up of 4 small slices, except for the zucchini dish, these are small sized formats. And of the 6 services, two are desserts, including a tiny pretzel. I have never eaten so much bread, which is said to be excellent. It's practically a joke charging us so much for vegetables in such a small portion. And for the service, absolutely not up to this type of restaurant, no synchronization in the service of the 4 guests, the layout of the plates was not the same for everyone and one of the cocktail glasses remained on the table practically all the time. We moved it for him to notice and despite the many servers, nothing was done. Rookie mistake and strangely, the same type of glass also remained on the table next to us. I would have given 3 stars, but when I think about it, even if it's only vegetables, it's still in the best dishes I've eaten and that's the important thing. And for the portions, I would have liked to have had more, but in the end, I was full enough. It is not worthy of a former best restaurant in the world, very very far from my experience last year at the 3rd best restaurant in the world, but yes, if we disregard the service, we eat very well."

Eleven Madison Park,50,As always a memorable experience,"Whenever I need a break from life, I fly to NYC and do a pit stop at Eleven Madison Park to refuel. I was not disappointed. Both food and wine were superb, but what really makes the difference is the service and attention to the customer. Just out of this world. I prefer not to touch my food and promptly got chef tweezers to eat my pretzels. Getting a little kitchen visit and shaking hands with Daniel Humm was most definitely a highlight. The summer menu focused on tomatoes. As usual 100% vegan. Thank you, EMP, for being there whenever I need you."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Plant based amazing experience,I got stuck in NY and paid a quick visit to this great place. Now 100% plant based. I encourage you the check the 7 days out on @netflix and see some of the wonderful details I was able to spot. I did not request it but got a visit to the kitchen and a treats there and to go.

Eleven Madison Park,50,Excellent food in stunning and comfortable dining area,"The dining room was stunning, spacious but not crowded. I was a solo diner but had a great table in the second room which has tables along the perimeter. Wait staff walk clockwise around a center table with flowers. I chose the seven course tasting. Each course has several components. The food was beautiful and delicious. The drink pairings were good—I chose the cheaper pairing and was not disappointed"

Eleven Madison Park,50,Perfection Personified with A Truly Exceptional and Memorable Culinary Experience!,"Eleven Madison Park was anchored to the bucket list and disappointment ensued and was anthropomorphised with the restaurant transitioning to a plant based menu. From our understanding, it was all previously about the duck?!?    With that said, we decided to experience said restaurant on a recent trip to New York and decidedly were not disappointed to say the least: the nine course tasting menu was outstanding, extraordinary and brilliant!!! At no point was there the slightest discontent with the cuisine being plant based over carnivorous. The ambiance and overall tone of atmosphere was faultless and flawless with each and every facet of the surround perfectly curated and orchestrated. The only aspect of the evening that outshone the gastronomy was the exemplary and superb level of attentive and conscientious servicing yielding perfection personified on the totality of the event. And, an event to be remembered it was....    On the negative side of the equation, we emphatically found the deluxe wine pairing to be overvalued for what it was given the selection of wines and relatively small pours provided.    On that annotation, we unquestionably look forward to many a return engagement at Eleven Madison Park when returning to New York."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Incredible,Simply the best food experience I have ever had (there is nothing else to say)  Thank you to all the team for an amazing souvenir  I don’t even understand how people can say that they didn’t like the food in the comment bellow… It was perfection

Eleven Madison Park,10,Terrible Food!,They have the worst food I’ve ever tried. My friends and I did 9 courses tasting menu and to be honest every dish was terrible. We had terrible experience. The only thing I like over there was service. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Food from McDonald’s taste better.

Eleven Madison Park,50,A must do for non meat & carnivores alike,Great experience as a vegetarian and also for my flexitarian partner . Meal was sublime & service flexible. In the heat of summer appreciated the flexible dress code .

Eleven Madison Park,10,"Boiled, salty vegetables! Not worth the visit.","This is easily the worst meal we have ever had. My wife and daughter are both vegans and they were appalled at the quality and taste of the food. The food is best described as over-salted boiled vegetables  While the service was attentive, even they could not make the food or its presentation better than average. Not one dish was worth mentioning/eating.  Compared to the other tasting menus in NYC and around the world, this place falls far far short of being a Michelin Starred restaurant.  This place is definitely not worth visiting even if it was free!!"

Eleven Madison Park,40,"A beautiful meal and great service, with a side of rancid tipping policy","Was very fortunate to go to Eleven Madison for Thanksgiving, and taste the special menu they had. The food -still fully plant based- was gorgeous and delicious, served for the occasion mostly as an array of sides (it usually is a series of different courses).    The option to ask for seconds, I’m guessing to mimic the American tradition of splurging on this day, was unexpected and not really necessary as the servings were very decently sized. Still, we used it and ordered two extra sides that we had found delicious! Great experience overall.    However, the restaurant has recently decided to reinstate tipping (which used to be included in the already very expensive menu): for an establishment of this standing which is already charging so much for an all vegan meal, explaining to clients that “the kitchen staff and the serving staff are not being paid the same way” and tipping is now needed to smooth those disparities is just unacceptable. Pay your employees for all the hard work they do, do not ask your clients to do it for you!"

Eleven Madison Park,10,Most overpriced meal to go hungry on,My husband and I went in with the highest expectations given the Michelin star rating and walked away feeling robbed. One asparagus cut in 4 pieces stuffed with rice does not constitute a dish. Good service could not compensate for the poor quality and quantity of food.

Eleven Madison Park,50,Top Restaurant in NYC,"Top healthy plant based food. Quality above any expectations. The mushroom butter with gluten free seeds bread out of this world. Markiya, Luke, Zhen made our night spectacular. Service is top notch. Food quality marvelous. Our favorite ever in NYC."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Good,"I recently celebrated my birthday at Eleven Madison Park, one of the best restaurants in the world, and it was an incredible experience. I had only heard about this restaurant through a Netflix series, but I was eager to try their winter menu, which is a six-course plant-based meal."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Great!,"The experience, atmosphere and food make this place a must visit. The cocktails are delicious. A great combination of products, textures, herbs and cooking methods is a great pleasure. Staff at the highest level. Ideal for special occasions and unforgettable gastronomic experiences."

Eleven Madison Park,10,Daniel Humm is a bum,"Really Bad. Do not let the Michelin stars fool you, that was from 6 years ago when this was a different restaurant. Service people here seem miserable. 20 mins to get our first drink. 10 mins of silence to even get a hello from a waiter. Food is literally just salt. Every dish we had my wife could've easily made herself at home. The dessert is literally a scoop of sherbert ice cream. We could not help but just laugh at that point. All the tables around us were also complaining and just like wtf is this a joke. Do not fool yourself I promise you will be thoroughly disappointed"

Eleven Madison Park,10,food is simply not delicious,"3 visits since plant based. I am mostly vegetarian and have eaten very well at Jean George, Daniel, Nobu ordering from their vegan and vegetarian tasting menus. there is nothing i like at Eleven Madison Park. It feels like a over -posed altar to plant based food which has the same basic musky undertone in all the sauces, even the mocktails (seedlip like in smell). Mr Humm will have to try harder to understand the extraordinary depth and breath to plant based cuisine which is delicious and sophisticated, and not keep feeding us pickled musky food and tell us this is what plant based is about. A tasting menu has to be exciting and delicious. you have failed, Mr Humm. each visit was worst than the previous- are you still engaged Mr Humm?"

Eleven Madison Park,20,Seriously? What a rip-off. Compelled to eat Popeye's when we got home...,"Every morsel of food we ate was delicious, amazing. But, all one gets here is a series of salty morsels of vegetables. It's like all the courses were missing the main dish and one was instead served excellent garnishes or sides. I felt like the chef was watching us all on closed circuit TV, mocking us to his friends, ""can you believe all these idiots are paying $1000+ for garden grown beats and potatoes...HA!"" After the first couple of dishes came out, we started playing a game where we would fantasize about what we could add to the plate to give it some substance. ""Imagine how good this would be with a soft boiled egg!"" ""With a few bites of chilean sea bass, this would be incredible!"" Alas no. After the wine pairing, we spent about $1600 for two people to eat crudite. Again, the food was tasty (if you love salt, but I do). It's just ridiculous to charge that much money for beats, mushroom water, and russet potatoes (yes, one of the dishes was a steamed russet potato.) It's not about it being vegetarian either. I have had many veggie only meals that were amazing and filling. It felt like they were running out of food and trying to figure out how to ration the last beat so that everyone would get a sliver of salty root. I would never, ever go back and certainly warn all people considering it to choose another spot. My husband, a person who is meticulous about eating healthy, organic food, devoured a stale, cold popeye's chicken sandwich our son left behind when we got home."

Eleven Madison Park,40,just ok,i was excited for the experience but just thought that in whole i just had an ok time. Considering the cost and the food and the ambience i was thinking to not go back. I wish the space had better decor but i did appreciate the invite into the kitchen for a special desert. It was nice to see how everything is run from that side of the restaurant. The staff were lovely. The food was tasty. We chose the 8 course menu option for $385.

Eleven Madison Park,30,expected so much more…,was disappointed… price/value for bar tasing menu is below zero! food was ok but far away from 3 stars michelin… the staff was very attentive and nice.

Eleven Madison Park,20,I cannot express my disappointment enough,"When this restaurant went vegan I was still confident that they would put on a good show and quality, mindblowingly tasty food, as the price point remained very high and the two michelin stars remained in tact. I was as wrong as the price was high.    Genuinely surprised by how unspectacular the taste of the food was and lack of the pomp and circumstance ceremony that usually means as such levels of dining that you're getting a show and a meal in one.    So desperate for trying to inject flavor into vegetables, some of the dishes were just overly salted veggies. I could just do that at home - but wouldn't, because hypotension.    Even if I made enough money to justify this type of dining on a regular basis, I would still feel pretty gross about it. What was supposed to be a special dining event I had waited years for was an anti-climatic assault to the wallet that I feel metaphorically sick about - I guess the one upside is the food didn't make me physically sick.    If you're on the fence about going, my advice would be to steer clear. It's unimpressive and the only thing spectacular about it, is how much of a waste of money it is. I don't understand how the staff and proprietor don't feel bad about fleecing people like this. The restaurant is supposed to have an ethical approach to not eating animals, what about in regards to not overcharging customers?    The restaurant was half empty through my entire experience and deservedly so."

Eleven Madison Park,10,What a $1000 meal won't get you - Good FOOD,"The best way to describe the tasting menu at Eleven Madison Park is like having a senior care home meal with a twist. That twist is loads of salt. Or maybe, that’s typical for the senior care culinary world.    The food, just like the service, the atmosphere and the design of Eleven Madison Park was soulless. Flavors were monotonous across the dishes. Every course felt like a boring variation of the previous one. The presentation was average at best and the servers described the dishes in well rehearsed robotic style.    Eleven Madison Park truly gives Michelin a bad rep.    The potato with black truffle and smoked potato broth was simply undercooked. The pretentious presentation that included pouring water into an oversized tajin like dish was amusing. What’s exciting about pouring water into a boiling surface and watching the steam coming out?    The bread that came with the tofu butter was the only thing to save the day. Thank god for bread. The tofu with onion had so much salt in it it could send any person with a heart disease to cardiac arrest.    Lastly, the ice cream. Get any gelato street vendor to give you their syrup, pure the entire thing in a bowl and you got Eleven Madison Park’s super sweet Tonka Bean ice cream.    At the end of the dinner, the server provided us with a bag that included the tasting menu in it and stated: “This is for you to remember what you experienced today.” To be perfectly honest, that’s an experience I’d like to forget.    On a scale of 1-10 I’d give Eleven Madison Park a 2. The only reason they scored 2 is the granola jar they provide at the end of the meal. The granola is delicious."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Sublime!!!,"Let's start by clearing up a couple of things. This is NOT a vegetarian restaurant. Previous reviewers labeling it as such should not be allowed in! Why such a harsh comment? We spoke directly with Chef Humm during our meal about the switch to a plant-based menu. As to his reason why, I paraphrase: ""Look what's happening to the world. It the right thing to do"". My wife and I are both ethical vegans and appreciated his similar philosophy about not abusing other species on this planet. There is just no need.    Others have raved about the food and service. Our experiences were identical. This is not an evening out to eat some food. This is a culinary experience which is to be savored as one is pampered by a perfectly choreographed serving staff.    Is it expensive? Of course it is. This is something many people would never be able to afford. Without any alcohol, it was a $1,000 evening (this included a 20% tip). It was worth every penny. The food, the staff, the ambience----food as theater!!!    DO NOT FEIGN ANY IGNORANCE WHEN YOU RESERVE, SPECIFICALLY ONLINE. YOU WILL BE CHARGED IN FULL (EXCLUDING TIP). THEIR CANCELLATION POLICY IS VERY CLEAR-----THERE ARE NO REFUNDS, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR SITUATION (E.G., ILLNESS, MISSED FLIGHT, ETC.)."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Experience culinary perfection at Eleven Madison Park.,"Experience culinary perfection at Eleven Madison Park.    From the moment you step into the elegant dining room with the tall ceilings, to the last bite of dessert, every detail is carefully crafted to create a truly unforgettable meal.    The only plant based menu with 3 Michelin stars, the menu is innovative and delicious.    We started with a hot pot of sweet potato with lemongrass, followed by a celery root with rice porridge, 3rd course was white turnip and horseradish, followed by a tofu course, 5th course was squash with fried shiso pepper, then bok choy with white truffle and finally grilled celery root with juniper and pine.    The palate cleanser was one of the best I’ve ever had, a grape sorbet and consommé, the flavors were perfect and so balanced.    Dessert was an apple with birch and cinnamon and ended with a pretzel with sesame and chocolate.    EMP is not to be missed."

Eleven Madison Park,50,Great experience sitting at the bar!,"I have visited Eleven Madison Park several times and have come back repeatedly to sit at the bar. Brian, the bartender, has made our experience so enjoyable, fun and entertaining. He is the best bartender and knows the menu inside and out!!!"

Eleven Madison Park,10,Extremely inflexible for a top restaurant that is supposed to be all about customer experience.,"I made a reservation for 4 at Eleven Madison Park as soon as my preferred date was available online for my wife's birthday, and the restaurant charged my credit card the full $1,755 immediately almost 2 months ahead of the reservation date. The day before my reservation (tomorrow), my wife and I tested positive for Covid. When I called the restaurant in hope of pushing out our reservation for a few days, I was given the ""friendly"" reminder that all reservations are final and non-refundable. My only option was to transfer my reservation to someone else. The ""guest relations"" person did not sound a bit concerned or apologetic about this unfriendly policy. I guess if one wants to have the full experience at a place like Eleven Madison Park, one must be prepared to handle the snooty and uncaring attitude that comes with it. Just don't make a reservation unless you are 100% sure you will not be sick on the date of the reservation. And please let me know if you have figured out how to do that."

Eleven Madison Park,10,Seems I’m not the only one give low rating.,3-star service but a meal of salty veggie. I’m not sure if my tastebud change due to Covid (my wife feels the same). Definitely won’t forget this experience.

Eleven Madison Park,50,"Dubious beforehand, But pleased afterwards","The pandemic kept us away until recently, after they converted to a vegetarian menu, prix fixe. I was concerned, especially after a scathing NY Times review. However, I was very pleasantly surprised about the food. It was flavorful and I didn’t miss the animal protein. I’m not a beet lover, but that dish was almost enough me to love beets. Service got a little erratic due the large tables and the need for multiple servers to deliver and finish each dish at your table. Overall, it was a great experience."

Eleven Madison Park,10,Biggest culinary disappointment of 2022,"I was excited for plant-based food, but the meal was just plain disappointing.    Service very poor for a 3 Michelin star restaurant - 25 minute wait between dishes, no engagement from the wait staff.    The sommelier’s recommendation was completely missed and again, he didn’t really look knowledgeable or couldn’t sell it. Either way, didn’t give a vibe of a 3 star restaurant.    Price tag - I understand paying this sort of money when I go to a restaurant that flies in premium tuna from Japan every day, not a place that gets some tomatoes and cucumber from upstate NY.    Biggest disappointment of 2022 and, to be honest, we just felt like we got scammed."

Eleven Madison Park,40,Really good but not worth the price as a vegan restaurant,"We had a good time on our second visit to 11 Madison Park but the first time was three years ago--before it became a vegan restaurant--and that was a superb experience. The price has not changed ($195+ tax for the six course ""bar tasting menu""), and in fact, has gone up in that the price no longer includes a gratuity for the servers. It also does not include any alcoholic beverages, so our final tally for the bar tasting menu + an $80 bottle of wine (one of the least expensive bottles available) + gratuity was well over $600. And honestly, the food was OK but not great and probably nothing I would have ordered given a menu of choices. While we were very impressed with the service and the fact that they actually KNEW we had been there before and sat us at the same table, I doubt that we would return if the price and vegan menu remain as they are."

Eleven Madison Park,40,Emperor’s new clothes,"Not sure I’ve seen so many staff working the tables. It certainly means you get great service, and for us it was a treat to be served by several super staff who had moved from Claridges in London. So overall, service was top notch.    Whilst the food was presented very beautifully, I’m afraid for us there was a big discrepancy between what we ate and what we paid. Lots of pretty dishes with fans of cucumber slices, but a big gap in actually feeling ‘fed’. A very expensive night out, followed by a comedy discussion the following morning as to why we felt so hungry! Come on guys, at least include some carbs!"

Eleven Madison Park,50,Absolutely brilliant.,"Ended my last vacation to NY here and I was not disappointed, of course. Incredible good, amazing experience and something every human should try at least once in their life. Will be back!"

Eleven Madison Park,50,Amazing meal and service,"Birthday dinner. Excellent meal and service. Had the wine pairing, all enjoyable. Chef Humm came to our table. Incredible that the bread could be made that way without butter. Could have just eaten a whole meal out of each of the tasting menu items and would have been pleased."

Eleven Madison Park,50,A vegetarian's dream,"I have been to fine dining vegetarian places before (e.g., Tian in Vienna or Munich), I was looking forward to visiting Eleven Madison Park again. And I was not disappointed.    Frankly, I do not understand people that complain about the new plant-based menu. Every bite I had was delicious and well balanced. It was also interesting to discover new vegetables, as well as for the first time tasting seitan that actually tasted amazing. So moist and so soft! Furthermore, some complained about the price of a ""handful of veggies."" I beg to differ. Getting high-quality organic vegetables, as well as the immense research that goes into developing these dishes needs to be acknowledged. There is no cookbook where you can look up, for example, how to make a plant-based caviar imitation.    Service is, as always, impeccable and friendly. There is always a server when you need them, but never one hovering. Details such as remembering the full name (even when horrendously complex), automatically detecting if a guest is left handed, or adding an additional wine pour because the sommelier is sure that more will be needed for the next dish set a high bar in the service industry. Knowing that I love the granola and having two bags for me to go is also a nice gesture.    Prices, I would say, are adequate for such simple yet incredibly sophisticated meal. The wines are delicious and perfectly paired. I am glad I came back after a longish break due to the pandemic. And I am sure I will be back for more."

Eleven Madison Park,30,Ironing the linens,"I was shocked to be dining in a Michelin star restaurant with the staff ironing the linens next to our table, not just one cloth but several. The food was interesting and lovely. The table side serves was like a crowd coming to the table, to much fuss. The parting gift were a surprise, didn’t expect that. Luckily we weren’t headed anywhere after. Also it was a gift to myself for my birthday."

Eleven Madison Park,30,What is happening to NYC restaurants?,"Ok, we tried the tasting menu. We actually love smaller portions of delicious items. These items were so very average. What in the world is happening with NYC staples that used to be fabulous and are now completely average??"

Eleven Madison Park,50,Eleven Madison Park is a perfect dining experience,"We try and get into the city often and we’re able to get a reservation for the bar for a 9:15 seating. The restaurant is spacious, beautiful and welcoming. It was exactly what I anticipated and we have been wanting to go to Eleven Madison Park for so long. The main dining room was full and lively, the bar is off the main dining area and was slightly quieter which was really nice after a busy day. The service was flawless, everyone was unbelievably professional and everything was perfect. Despite the elegance everyone was down to earth and conversational. Every course was uniquely presented and perfectly orchestrated. Beyond all of that each dish was delicious. The creativity and the combination of ingredients and flavor far outweighed my expectations. There is almost nothing I enjoy more than long conversations over an exquisite meal. There is nothing that they could improve on and we hope to be back soon."

Eleven Madison Park,10,Overrated place,This is an overrated place. The people who came later than me and my friend got served faster than me and my friend. This is unfair.

L'Ambroisie,50,a culinary institution,"L'Ambroisie has been a culinary institution in Paris and indeed France since the early 1980's, and we wanted to finally visit it before Chef Bernard Pacaud decides to retire. His motto ""Quêter le beau produit"" on the restaurant website aptly summarizes his philosophy - let the best products speak for themselves and keep your dishes simple. There is no menu and you order à la carte - usually a starter, a main a a dessert. My wife and I chose the langoustine on a bed of spinach with curry sauce and a sesame tuile on top as starter - that is an emblematic dish of the place and was superb, the curry sauce complementing and by no means overpowering the sweetness of the superb langoustines. My daughter had the oeuf mollet chaud/froid au caviar cristal, and she looked (and was) super happy. I had the escalopines de bar sur lit d'artichaut au caviar as a main, another signature dish - it was superb.  The navarin de homard au romarin of my daughter was very good, and so was the agneau de Lozère en croute of my wife. The tarte au cacao amer et glace vanille was my dessert - it was ethereally light. I tasted the dacquoise praliné of my daughter and, surprise, that was even better....  We had a bottle of Guigal Condrieu la Doriane with the lunch, and I had a Marc de Bourgogne as digestif. The sommelière and team of waiters were professional and everything but formal - we had quite a few laughs with the sommelière and a head waiter who had worked in Tokyo for a number of years.....  So yes, Ambroisie lived up to its reputation. It is French classical cooking in the purest sense, which in the current times means it is not as 'fashionable' as, for example, Alléno or Plénitude. But the quality of the products is 'irréprochable' - I had to compare the langoustine to the one I have had on two occasions at Sonnora in Germany, and the caviar was every bit as good (and plentiful) as during a dinner at Les Amis in Singapore a few years ago."

L'Ambroisie,50,Super formal yet friendly service. Elegant main room. Very refined and tasty food.,"This is my third time at L'Ambroisie, once for lunch and now twice for dinner. The restaurant service, ambiance, and food have never disappointed and always exceeded. Very fine French haute cuisine in a very formal setting... with also a super polite and formal service (Pascal is a wonderful host). If this is what you want for your dining experience (which we did), then L'Ambroisie may be the pinnacle to cap off your Parisian visit. Otherwise, there may be other fine dining establishments that may be a better match.    The new decor in the main dining room is fabulous, although we also liked the former tapestry-covered walls.    In my humble opinion, the three-star Michelin rating is very well deserved."

L'Ambroisie,20,Getting leg cramps at the tiny room they squeezed us into,"Few issues in this 3-M star establishment —  1) I’m one who’s sensitive to stratification. I mean that there are three distinct rooms to this tiny place and one is definitely grander than the next than the third. And I somewhat noticed that all the Asians were cramped in that tiny front room and the Caucasians were placed in the grander rooms that did not give one leg cramps  2) food was good but not exceptional, especially when compared to the rest of the 3-M rated places in Paris. It was clearly a few notches below  3) at such high prices, it’s hard to justify ordering not your usual proteins. Should I really pay E110 for pigeon?  4) I guess it’s okay to serve a slice of chocolate mousse pie with a small scoop of ice cream but don’t charge me E38 for it. I’ll pay that amount but the chef has to make more of an effort to present it to me  5) Service was so-so but was uneven, overbearing in some, somewhat aloof in all of them.  Overall this is the least value for money among the 3-M rated places in Paris. The uneven-ness in the quality and size of the rooms creates unnecessary disparity of treatment among its clients. I would rate L’Ambrosie 3/6 when compared to its competitors."

L'Ambroisie,50,Lunch,We had lovely time at the restaurant. The menu was tasty. The services were the top notch. We really enjoyed the experience.

L'Ambroisie,50,3 Star Worthy,What a wonderful experience. From the incredible food to the impeccable service. Its restaurants like these that give credibility to the Michelin Star Brand. Highly Recommend!

L'Ambroisie,50,Stunning experience,"The food was perfection perfection perfection. Elevated. Artful. Incredible flavor nuances. And the staff was very helpful, designed a perfect menu for our lunch. And they spent quite a bit of time explaining to us how several of the dishes were prepared. Wines are not inexpensive, but there are affordable sleepers on the list if you look haed enough for them. We picked a Moreau Grand Cru Chablis Les Clos that was about €220 and was stunning with all of the courses."

L'Ambroisie,50,The pinnacle of traditional French cuisine.,"Our short trip to Paris was topped by our dinner at the pinnacle of French cooking at this restaurant. It is unlike othe Michelin 3 restaurants that we have dined in , being a La carte and not a 4 hour long affair. The portions are hearty and full of tradition and flavor. It’s a somewhat understated decor but very tasteful and traditional. I am glad we visited this amazing place."

L'Ambroisie,50,I wish I could dine here more often,"I have dined here 6 times in 5 years, it's not more because I live across the Channel and because I feel I should occasionally try other restaurants as well. I've already planned my next meal here.  Those who come here for the wrong reasons or with the wrong expectations may leave feeling cheated or deceived. That's perfectly understandable, everyone's different. Just go elsewhere. Same goes for those who come here just to pose and post.  For the minority who are able to understand and appreciate the spirit and purpose of this temple of French gastronomy, we pray that it continues for many more years in the Place des Vosges."

L'Ambroisie,50,L’Ambroisie does not need another review. But it deserves one,"I agree that l’Ambroisie is unlike any other 3 star restaurant, and that those who expect arrogance and tiny portions will have plenty of better options elsewhere.  The staff makes you feel at home. Followed Daniele’s suggestions and we chose a spectacular yet easy wine.  Generous portions, unpretentious top service, uncomplicated genuine menu—L’Ambroisie in a nutshell."

L'Ambroisie,50,Fine dining experience,Easily our best meal in Paris! Lovely and hospitable restaurant - the chef and wife greeted everyone. The service was outstanding and the food was very good . The dessert in particular! The egg with caviar was outstanding and we loved the veal. Overall a memorable experience!

L'Ambroisie,50,Simply Fantastic Restaurant,"L’Ambroisie is truly a gem. Probably the best restaurant I’ve ever eaten at in Paris … and that’s saying a lot.    The food is beyond superb … unique, delicate, brilliantly prepared…. oh so tasty.    This is the kind of meal where you close your eyes after every bite and thank the gods for the experience. And you simply have to have their egg dish as an entree.    The service is superb and everything you would expect from Michelin 3 Star. But the food is simply fantastic. It obviously ain’t cheap, but it is totally worth it.    Major kudos to Bernard and his lovely wife Daniele Pacaud. I’m not sure how food gets any better than this. I go to L’Ambroisie every time I come to Paris. You should too.    Merci Beaucoup"

L'Ambroisie,50,What I expected,"Probably a few decades ago, most 3-star restaurants were like L'Ambroisie: à la carte only, luxury ingredients like caviar or lobster and impeccable classical technique. Today, L'Ambroisie stands almost alone among all the tasting menus, culinary tricks, new Nordic and Japanese influences, etc. I definitely join those who say that if you are interested in fine dining, you should come here at least once and see for yourself. Based on some of the reviews and comments I have read, it seems that people generally find fault with two aspects of dining at L'Ambroisie: the allegedly haughty service and the fact that you can get three courses here for a price you'd pay even at other top Parisian restaurants for a long tasting menu. To that I would say: if you only go out to eat at a top restaurant once or twice in your life, maybe indeed this is not the place. However, if you do it regularly, I cannot understand why would not embrace the difference and focus not on how many courses you are served, but what the quality is. And the quality is extremely high. As for the service, we did not experience any arrogance. It is formal, of course, but also friendly and very professional. My advice: go to the website, look at the menu and the prices and then decide if you want to try it. If so, just enjoy. And there is even a relative ""bargain"": a selection of desserts, including the deservedly famous chocolate tart."

L'Ambroisie,10,"Bad service and atmosphere, okay food","I went to this restaurant with two friends. Our first impression was that the space is old, dark and unwelcoming. We were asked if we wanted an ""aperitif"". I asked for a cosmopolitan and my friends asked for Coke and Coke Zero. We were told they didn't serve any of those things. The only cocktails they offered are Américano and dry martini. That was already kind of odd. Then the menu was only available in French, even though none of the people in the tables around us spoke French. A waitress proceeded to translate the menu line by line into English, with a very strong French accent and leaving lots of things untranslated. It was harder to understand than the written French, so we asked her to stop. At this point I was inclined to leave, but one of my friends didn't want the confrontation, so we stayed. A more junior waiter was able to translate the menu somewhat successfully, but then he wasn't allowed to take our order: That had to be done by the previous waitress, with whom we couldn't communicate well. In the end the food was decent, but paled in comparison to Le Cinq and L'Arcane, the two other fancy restaurants we ate at in our visit to Paris. The only part of the meal where expectations were met was the very high price. We didn't stay for dessert."

L'Ambroisie,50,Ignore the bad reviews. Spectacular fine dining with excellent service.,"I felt I had to write a review because of the negative reviews regarding their service or their price. First, it’s a three star restaurant and if the prices shock you, it’s not for you. Second, the service was spectacular. It is traditional fine dining. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating. If you don’t like a somewhat formal fine dining experience, this isn’t for you. But if you appreciate getting dressed up and want a spectacular meal and are willing to pay for it, this is the place to eat in Paris."

L'Ambroisie,20,Disappointing on a few levels.,"The minute I opened the menu and realized that the cheapest appetizer was 120€, my automatic thought was to run away just as fast as my size 12 suede Ferragamos would take me….but then I took a deep breath, mustered my composure, and became resigned to the fact that I was about to spend $1000 on dinner for two. It was my partner’s birthday, and he wanted to celebrate in a special way while in Paris, and so he chose L’Ambrosie. There had been an uncomfortable mixup with the reservation, which we’d made two weeks earlier. The day before we’d received notice that our reservation had been cancelled, because we had not confirmed––even though we had, and had received emailed proof. In a fairly cumbersome back-and-forth, mediated through the concierge at our hotel, we were finally given the green light, after receiving some facocta story that a person with the same name had reserved for lunch, and failed to confirm––and there’d been a mixup. It was a foreshadow of the gaslighting we were to receive later. We arrived on time, and walking into these very formal, and very expensive restaurants always feels like walking into a mortuary because of the seriousness and silence––especially given the stark contrast of having just passed lively crowds in outdoor cafes having a blast in Place des Vosges. The decor was bit odd with some bold composite geometric panels on the walls that I guess would be considered 90s Memphis Style, but I found myself surprised that there didn’t seem to be a cohesive design scheme throughout, but whatever…I guess when you have 3 Michelin stars, you don’t have to rely so much on design gimmicks. Our server apologized for the mixup with the reservation, and again expressed the same story of someone with the same name, who’d failed to confirm. He promised something “special” later as an accommodation. He handed us the menu, which is exclusively in French, which felt exclusionary rather than exclusive. With only 4-5 one-line appetizers, entrees, and desserts, it just wouldn’t have been that hard to put a one-line English subtitle beneath each….oh well. The server went quickly through each line item in English, and I appreciated that, but had trouble focusing because I was trying to recover from the gut punch of the prices. Giving credit where credit is due, the food was amazing and some of the best I’ve ever had. My partner started with the escargot, and I had the soft boiled egg with caviar, and we both had the beef for the main course. Everything was really exquisite with regard to the taste and presentation. Similarly, the champagne and red wine (one of the less expensive ones) were each excellent. One thing that gave me pause with regard to the service, was that my partner was having springtime allergies, and so went to the restroom to blow his nose after the appetizer. I thought it odd that in a Michelin 3 star restaurant they brought the entrees and were about to serve his to an empty seat….I was about to say something, fortunately he returned just in the nick of time. After some superb palate cleansers, without having inquired about preferences they brought dessert which was a chocolate tart with a candle in it. I was impressed that they acknowledged his birthday, and they indicated that this was the special surprise they had promised. My partner blew out the candle and they took it away to cut it up. As they were preparing it they brought out a prelude of berries and whipped cream. They then brought out the generous slices of the chocolate tart. Others in the room were also having berries followed by the chocolate tart and I found myself wondering if they were eating slices taken from the tart that my partner had just blown out a candle on….we’re both doctors, so perhaps that’s just my germaphobic obsessions running wild. We finished at a leisurely pace, the service was efficient and formal, and generally pleasant. The gaslighting occurred when they brought the bill. They’d charged us both for the chocolate tart that was supposed to be the “special” surprise for both messing up my partner’s reservation, and for his birthday. Recognizing that this must be an error, we called the server over and questioned him. To my horror, he actually doubled-down on the charge, indicating that he hadn’t charged us for the other dessert––the berries and whipped cream which I’m nearly certain they serve gratis prior to every dessert course to every table. We then indicated that we hadn’t ordered that either, and while we were grateful, that we didn’t feel we should have to pay for something that we didn’t order. Honestly, I have no problem paying for something I’ve ordered, but if we’d ordered dessert, there was a meringue rhubarb compote that I would have ordered instead––I don’t love chocolate. After looking at the server incredulously for a few moments, he shrugged his shoulders and said “ok”, and went back and prepared a bill without the dessert items on it. We left, and the servers were a bit stiff on the way. It’s the most bizarre experience I’ve ever had in a restaurant and absolutely not what I would have expected at Michelin 3 star restaurant…..talk about leaving a bad taste in your mouth."

L'Ambroisie,20,A Parisian Travesty,"I had been to this restaurant when I was 9 years old and it was a one star; I remembered it as one of the best meals of my young life. 40 years later I returned and it was so disappointing. The waiter was rude when I asked for a non-alcoholic drink. The scallop appetizer was lukewarm and lacked flavor. I had a much better scallop dish at Le Grand Controle at lunch today. My cousin had the baby lamb which like another reviewer stated was also fatty (and undercooked) for her. The Bresse chicken has no flavor (and is also undercooked). They serve a few meager slices of a whole chicken (and probably eat the rest in the back themselves, if they can stomach it themselves). The dessert was probably the best part. But the whole experience was stilted, uncomfortable and unappetizing. An absolute let down."

L'Ambroisie,50,Absolute classical perfection,"What can I said about this icon of French high cuisine that hasn’t already been said? 3 Michelin stars for the last 37 years. This is the best meal I’ve had in 20 years. Won’t say more. Go, and bring a fat wallet."

L'Ambroisie,50,Breathtakingly amazing,"August during Covid times and still amazing, especially our waiter who really made the difference between simply fabulous food and a fabulous evening."

L'Ambroisie,10,Faded Star - avoid !,"No “wow” or pizzazz factor in the professionally executed dishes. Why bother when so many other Chefs care passionately about the food they produce and want to excite the diner. It’s staid, soon to drop a Star or two. Pushy staff tried to convince my wife to order more courses, making her feel guilty and then haughtily scoffed at our desire to only have wine by the glass... Shouldn’t we assume their wine-by-the-glass is good? At €40 a glass, it should be - but why the negative attitude?"

L'Ambroisie,20,Does NOT deserve 3 stars,One of the most disappointing meals I had in 2020. Place des Vosges is one of the most beautiful places in Paris. Absolutely terrible and expensive. They try to impress with caviar or lobster. It feels like a dinner from the 1980s and the menu has not updated itself.

L'Ambroisie,30,Bad experience at L'Ambroisie in Paris,Went for dinner to celebrate a special wedding anniversary and expected a terrific experience from start to finish. Ambience was lovely and service was fine until we complained about excessively fatty baby lamb chops (more fat than meat.) The other dishes were okay but not exceptional. Definitely not Michelin 3 star quality and we have eaten at many other Michelin 3 star restaurants in Paris and other French cities. Very disappointing and not anywhere near worth the price.

L'Ambroisie,20,Disappointing food in beautiful setting,"Place du Vosges is perhaps one of the most beautiful places in Paris. L’Ambroisie has over the years declined. Their famous egg dishes are flat. The seafood tries to over compensate with size rather than flavor. While service remains strong, the menu no longer deserves any Michelin stars."

L'Ambroisie,10,Terrible service and terrible food.,"The waiter was rude and unacommidating, seemed irritated I was dining alone. The food was terrible and flavorless. I am a foodie and have dined all over the world. The food was over the top expensive, $64 US for a side if broccoli for one. The dinner was over $300 and no alcohol included. Instead of a luxurious dining experience, it was arrogant and patronizing toward the customer. The staff was rude and judge mental. I would recommend any of the other fine dining establishments in Paris."

L'Ambroisie,50,Pilar of French gastronomy,"Bernard Pacaud is a legendary chef who worked his way up to finally run his own 3 star restaurant, now for many years. The location on Place des Vosges is unique and the interior is classic elegant.    Going to Ambroisie is a complete experience, including the ambiance, the impeccable service and the flawless food.    The cuisine is based on solid experience and mastery of classics. In the fall, try for example the tourte with duck and foie gras, based on a secret recipe and baked for 2 days (sliced it serves 6 - 8 guests).    Seasonal menu with proven, delicious dishes. And an impressive wine list, which is of course mostly French."

L'Ambroisie,50,A once in a lifetime meal,Speechless is how I was left after eating at L’Ambrosie. I can happily say it was a meal of a lifetime for me. I feel completely ruined and will compare any meal to the exquisite food I just ate here. My fine dining experience started from the moment I stepped out of the car and how warmly we were greeted. The food is indescribable. It is something you not only taste but FEEL down to your soul. The combination of flavors were a party in my mouth as I savored every bite. I did not stop to take pictures because the meal called for full attention. I will remember this meal forever and wish for others to experience the fantastic caliber of this amazing restaurant. We left with a printed menu signed by the chef which I will treasure. Even writing this review I find it difficult to express or adequately describe how PERFECTLY prepared the meal was. The staff also pays attention to every small detail and are so thoughtful and patient. You can tell they take great pride in where they work and operate with excellence.

L'Ambroisie,50,Where the guest is #1,"Eating at L'Ambroisie is like having a meal at a really rich Parisian friend's house who took their personal time to prepare a meal just for you. The entire wait staff treats you with friendly deference. They are excited to answer questions, make suggestions and interact with the diners, should they be invited to. None of the stuffiness that turns many away from wanting to experience a 3 star restaurant. One goes for the food, ambiance and service. In whichever order is the diner's priority, L'Ambroisie hits its 3-star mark on each one. With the menu changing seasonally, we will make it a point to find our way back!"

L'Ambroisie,50,Chasing Michelin Stars Best Restaurant,"A group of friends and I (10 in total) decided to put together a trip to France that would highlight the very best of French cuisine, wine, and touring. And in our four nights in Paris, our one Michelin 3-star experience was L’Ambroisie.    We had two tables of 5, in two different dining rooms, with two different menus. At my table, we started with an almost unbelievable prawn and curry dish that was simply sublime. Prawn and curry as a description simply do not do this dish proper respect. The textures and flavors were simply out of this world. We followed with a “green egg” with caviar, a description that is world’s away from doing this great entree justice. Unexpected flavors and textures that were sublime. We followed with a blue lobster main course that has to be the best lobster I have ever had anywhere in the world. We topped off dinner with a chocoholic’s favorite desert that was so light and so chocolaty as to be almost unbelievable.    Great wine, phenomenal service, and the most wonderful French ambiance made this restaurant experience the highlight of our 17-Michelin star, two week experience.    L’Ambroisie is what the best of French dining is all about!"

L'Ambroisie,50,Absolutely delightful.,"I made a solo visit here since it’s been a very long time that I had visited a 3 star Michelin restaurant. In short, L’Ambroisie exceeded all my expectations.    I highly recommend reservations here in advance, do not expect to get a table by dropping by. It seems that they block off and/or restrict the number of guests for one single night.    Service was marvelous, attentive, and personal. You will not be rushed into ordering or completing your food fast — this is an experience and they are keeping it that way.    For those who do not speak French (such as myself), do not worry, the waiters are able to explain what each item on the menus are. In fact, during my visit, the entire restaurant were non French speakers.    I ordered the duck foie gras, pigeon, and chocolate cake. Between these food items, the chef will also provide complimentary amuse-bouche.    The foie gras was incredibly tasteful — a blend of mint, spices, and radish. Supported with bread if you prefer it that way.    The pigeon was cooked similarly to a steak, medium rare, skin was very lightly fried and just right. I’m not sure if i was eating a pigeon or steak at that point but it was amazing.    Lastly, the chocolate cake, soft top crust with a melted center, hard bottom crust. Supported with a small dish of 3 bite sized desserts and chocolate coated almonds.    Exceptional, would highly recommend anyone that is looking to try this place."

L'Ambroisie,50,Favorite restaurant in the world.,"I came here 20 years ago when I lived in Paris, and I’m happy to report that it hasn’t changed. Still sublime. We were treated like kings, and the meal was superb from start to finish, with zero pretentiousness like you often get in fancy French restaurants. Favored by celebrities and presidents like Chirac, Clinton and Obama. And set in the most beautiful square in Paris. Place des Voges."

L'Ambroisie,50,Bernard Pacaud,"Throughout the years, I have eaten in many, many restaurants in France especially in Paris but the chef of this restaurant Bernard Pacaud never ceased to amaze me.  I believe it is a mistake to name him only as a 3 stars Michelin chef but instead he should be classified as the heart of Paris..  when i eat his food, i do not feel the1, 2, or 3 stars but i experience the creativity of his mind that flows through his dishes."

L'Ambroisie,50,Outstanding 3 star Michelin,"Have tried other 3 star Michelins in Paris and this one is a true 3*. Went for a romantic birthday dinner and had the most incredible meal , impeccable service in a beautiful residential- like setting. Everything we ordered was outstanding and we absolutely loved our waiter and sommelier. Not pretentious whatsoever which is quite rare in this kind of establishment. Pricey bit worth every Euro. Hoping to go back and re-experience this magical and memorable meal."

L'Ambroisie,50,Excellent,Save your penny's for this one Excellent all the way thru 3 people 3 different entrees main and dessert Very pricey but excellent

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,France,"The restaurant is very cute. The staff is very friendly and the service is good. I would recommend this restaurant - absolutely. It's a perfect romantic dinner or a special day, especially if you've never been to Paris!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Splurge!! Utterly Exquisite!,"Splurge! It's totally worth it!! The food was exquisite, delicious, presented as art. There seemed to be an amuse bouche prior to every course (and they sent us home with a chocolate brioche for the next morning's breakfast). The staff made us feel pampered and special, and they were never condescending - all had smiles and seemed relaxed, focused, utterly charming. Claire Sonnet (Directrice de Salle) was the finishing touch - so warm and friendly - she was amazing to watch in the dining room as she seemed to lead the staff almost undetectably. An unbelievable dining experience that we will never forget."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Wow!!!!!!!,"The service was absolute stunning. The waiters were all over helping you and responding to all your demands.  We tried almost all the main courses and I have to say for the lobster ...outstanding juicy taste, for the lamb ....and veal well cooked and delicious and finally the pigeon breast was a new great exerience since we tried this meat for first time. The combination the chef made at all the plates with vegetables and sauces were so deeply searched and the result to all were ....treasure plates .  Finally the desserts are from another world...do not make the mistake and not have all of them.  Simply the best!!!!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,10,Awful reservation rules,"Be aware: when you make a reservation you will be asked to make a deposit of EUR 100 per person (which is perfectly okay) that will only be refunded to a bank account in case of cancellation and not (like any other restaurant or hotel) to the credit card that was charged. You will be asked to provide bank details, a bank statement and a screen shot of your account…    I just experienced this situation and think that this is not acceptable. It puts internal rules above client’s ease if handling.    We will not stay or eat at any establishment of that group again."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,20,"Dull food, dull service. Not close to Michelin level","Not worth a visit.  How this restaurant ever got a Michelin star is beyond me.  The food is not even close to match the price level.  The service is beyond poor. It seems like the waiters just read a book about “how to act posh”..  An example, I wanted to take off my blazer as it was unbearable hot in the restaurant. (Wearing a full tuxedo, so shirt under the blazer)  And was promptly told that was not allowed.. so was a other 70+ man who was dripping sweat. For context, we had booked 85% of the restaurant.    The food would be ok, for a price point 80% lower. But nowhere near this print point.  And so is the service.    Dull food, dull service."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,20,Disappointment,"We drove 700 km because I wanted to have dinner in an important restaurant for my birthday. We booked a month in advance.As soon as we entered in the restaurant , I missed flowers, some kind of candle on the table, beautiful glasses, tablecloths. Cold minimalism.  Champagne and an important bottle of wine was served in a simple basic glasses.  We started with chefs greeting a couple of lettuce leaves.Than we order marinated gamberoni from San remo and sea scallops from Dieppe. Both semi-raw with the explanation that these are autentic flavors....  We continued with Fire roasted blu lobster and grilled locally-caught fish. Again nothing special and half raw.  I willl not write about the desert because they were so poor that i have no words.  The waiters were friendly, non stop present.  But for this money and this fame I expected significantly more from appearance, presentation and tastes."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,20,Disappointing return to a once much esteemed restaurant,"We returned after a gap to a restaurant which we have visited many times since it was opened- and for the first time we really did not enjoy the experience at all. The room is still lovely - but the standard of everything else had declined seriously since previous visits.    The dining room remains iconic and outstanding. By contrast, the food was unmemorable - the imagination, innovation and excitement enjoyed on previous visits had disappeared. We felt that we were participating in a bad performance, rather than experiencing the best cooking in the world - and felt that M Ducasse’s influence had diluted.    The series of extra amuses bouches were not particularly memorable and dragged out dinner unnecessarily. As one other diner has commented over three hours was too long for this performance.    The nominally suave service felt for the first time intrusive .    Individual courses were well cooked - but nothing more and simply did not justify the exceptionally excessive prices that were charged for food, which was not particularly “worth a detour” and certainly not worth what was charged.    We would have been happy to pay for the quality experienced previously - but we did not receive this - and felt for the first time that there are many better haute cuisines experiences in or near Monaco.."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Fabulous birthday DInner,"A lovely 5 star experience. Wonderful staff, fabulous wine and delicious food. We did the agape, but next time I would just order a la carte. I was a little shocked by some guests wearing sneaker in this stunning room."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,The best fine dining I've ever experienced!,"We went for lunch on a Saturday and opted for the Riviera menu in which we chose a starter, main and dessert. However, you receive many more courses than just these three, from the cheese selection, to an array of fish, panettone and more. My favourite was the mushrooms and radicchio from Liguria starter, which is possibly the best starter I've ever had.    The service was outstanding and the best I've ever received, everyone is so welcoming and are there for anything you might need. The champagne to start was lovely and we all enjoyed the wine pairings with the courses. It's beautiful and overall the best restaurant we have ever tried (there was a group of 4 of us), it's hard to imagine another restaurant topping this from the food, to the atmosphere, and the exceptional service.    After such a wonderful experience we are now planning to visit Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester in London!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Lovely family Sunday lunch.,"It was a beautiful Sunday in Monaco and we were seated on the lovely terrace overlooking the Casino Square. We had a very well paced lunch with super service which was full of highlights; for me the Lobster was excellent - so many flavors that all worked together - and the Soufflé absolutely delightful. The cheese selection hit all the right notes, the wine pairing was very well done and I also really enjoyed being able to select a variety of herbs for the tea."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,An Icon,"Le Louis XV is where it all started for Alain Ducasse.    The beautiful dining room and terrace with its position on Place du Casino effortlessly makes this restaurant one of the most glamorous dining venues on earth.    Service is fantastic and friendly as always.    The food is good though I think could do with being updated and changed to become more like the old Plaza Athénée restaurant in Paris perhaps. It would be nice to also see the restaurant revert back to the old days before the renovation with the gold cutlery and more traditional furniture and way of doing things, though I sadly don’t think this will happen.    A must visit legendary restaurant."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,ducasse surpasses ducasse !!!,"the worlds greatest restaurant, firstly, 380 euros each, without drinks, without tax, and service charge, be prepaired for a huge bill, WORTH EVERY MOUTHFULL, le meurice, dorchester both ducasse, was topped by this EASLY. the surroundings, service, impeccable in every sense, every whim/desire is catered for, IF YOU HAVE a vintage glass of dom perginon, and a 2018, petrus red wine, it makes the eve even more magic like lee and myseld did, you feel like a roman emperor/queen/king, for the few hours you dine here, monsier ducasse was so gracious signing our menu , every smell, mouthfull, energy and vibes was breath taking ANY FOODIE, SAVE UP, VISIT ONCE IN YOUR LIFE, it will be as memorable as ANYTHING you have done in your life, total bill inc petrus/dom perignon/water service charge for 2 was just under 1500 euros for both of us"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,30,Liked Paris better,"We had visited the Paris restaurant a few years ago and are big fans of Ducasse. I really wanted to be wowed and blown away by this visit. We visited two other Michelin star restaurants (1 star) and were happier with those, at half the price. I will say that the service was on point and no snooty at all, even the sommelier was super friendly even though I was getting glasses of wine. The food was not compelling, there was just nothing to get excited about. I think the morel appetizer was the star, for me, but the rest was underwhelming."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,30,"Nice food, small portions, expensive but beautiful restaurant","The food was nice but tiny portions of course and over priced.    They got my order wrong and brought a vegetable dish too which ended up being complimentary given I didn't order it. I felt stared at by staff after that happened (unsure if I'm being paranoid) and was uncomfortable they thought I did that on purpose... then again, the staff were all friendly and they gave me a free small dessert which was NOT nice and super sour.    Beautiful restaurant but I wasn't allowed to film the restaurant from the entrance as it would disturb guests though one staff member, had, prior to a senior staff members refusal said I could film from the entrance.    Received complimentary chocolate which was great.    The service overall was pretty good as one would expect.    I'd recommend as a one off if you like aesthetics and don't mind small portions and expensive food"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,"Brilliant , unforgettable","After corona, I visited this restaurant to see if is the same experience as before.  Brilliant service, food, presentation, wine list, perfect organisation.Without any mistake.Value for money and deserve the best comments.  In Monte Carlo, without competition, the best restaurant."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,10,Worst *** Michelin restaurant,"We've been to this restaurant 20 years ago and it was great, so we returned.  The ambiance is elegant, but the food was below all expectations. Absolutely tasteless, poorly presented and with no imagination or innovation.  The price (which it doesn't matter if all is great) which is high, and I would recommend you keep a huge distance from Le Louis XV...  It's not worth even ONE star!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,A great experience,"A truly wonderful experience from start to finish, and as one would expect flawless service, wonderful food. We definitely return."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,Fell short of expectations,"The dining room ambience at Le Louis the XV is elegant and airy. The staff is very professional, personable and well-seasoned. The breads were good but the appetizers lackluster. One offering was essentially slices of spring roll with a dipping sauce. Another was nothing more than steamed seafood on heated rocks. That was especially disappointing for three-star dining. Chilled langoustines and Gamberoni from San Remo with rockfish gelee and caviar were both very good but you pay accordingly for these. The coastal turbot was also fine, though fairly mundane. The herbal tea service was a refreshing touch. The soufflés were truly outstanding but some of the other dessert accoutrements were again, ok. The wine list is good and fairly priced. The 2011 Lafon Meursault Poruzot we drank was perfect with our seafood. Our impression is that for the price paid, Le Louis XV needs to take the food offerings up a couple notches. Of the eight Michelin three-star restaurants at which we dined this trip, the food here ranked low. We also have dined at Ducasse’s Plaza Athenee and Dorchester restaurants and liked the London outpost the best, food-wise."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,"Superb restaurant, where everything is perfect","We had been at this place in the past and the first thing we did when we visited Monaco again was to enjoy the pleasure to eat at this restaurant. Everything is perfect. First of all, the food of course, which is out of this world, the atmosphere which is great and the service which is also exceptional. You feel great and you just want to enjoy the moment.  The wine list is exceptional as well.  Very nice evening."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,Nowhere near 3 Michelin star,"I’m not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews. Ive been to numerous Michelin star restaurants and 3 stars as well, however, this was nowhere near 3 stars in my opinion. There was no creativity in the dishes, the service was average, and none of the dishes stood out. I actually got rather annoyed how slow the service was considering it is a 3 Michelin star. I could go on about how average this place is. It seems like a tourist trap since it’s in the hotel and in the heart of Monte Carlo. The reason I give it 4 stars is because I you can’t give half stars and I wouldn’t say it’s a 3/5. The decor is definitely stunning but that is really it lol. Just a nice photo op. Definitely not worth the 800 + euro."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,An incredible meal,"Definitely an incredible restaurant and the only negative I would have was something that was exterior to the restaurant in so far that there was someone outside revving his motor engine quite loudly.    We ordered minestrone and the pasta as a starter, which were both excellent…..pretty much beyond excellent. We then ordered a whole fish which was of course excellent and fantastically filleted. My wife’s soufflé was the best she had that week (she had 3 during that week). I had a fraisier which was very good.    The mignardises were not the best I ever had and certainly not on the level of Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas. Of course, everything is relative.    In any case, for anyone who can afford it, it is worth the visit."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,exceptional,"We were invited to Monaco by clients to sign an important contract, after this signature they had reserved in this very high quality restaurant, we had taken the menu with many dishes, a mixture of unknown flavors, everything is so good cuisine , the staff made us feel comfortable and provided us with classy service,"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Perfection.,Perfection. Incredible service that’s both friendly and outstandingly luxurious. Decor flawless. Food impeccable. A bucket list experience. Go!

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,A true 3 Michelin Star experience,"Food is very, very good, service is superb. There were several very tasty dishes buy only one truly memorable - the steam cooked seafood on rocks :)    Highly recommended although very, very pricey for what you get. Having said that, ANYTHING is extremely pricey in Monte Carlo."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,What amazing experience,This is amazing experience to have chance to be there. Le Louis XV know with the famous sheff Alain Ducasse. This is like a fairytale. So delicious and amazing atmosphere. I hardly recommend.

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,A meal experience to be enjoyed! Delectable lunch.,"When you enter this restaurant you will feel pampered and you will perceive that the staff will go the extra mile to satisfy your gourmand wishes.  Aside from the lunch menu I tried the legumes des jardins de provence and the stocafi monaco-style.flavourful dishes.  Since I was undecided I ordered the baba and the souffle. Ambrosial delicacies.  The amouse bouches, cheeses, breads as the petit fours are delicious."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Just superb! The best meal I’ve had.,"I had the Riviera lunch menu, scallops, fowl and fig dessert, but the service, the interim courses, just every detail was something else. There is a reason for the 3 Michelin stars, and I was blown away.  The front of house staff couldn’t have been kinder, more polite and friendly, as a solo diner often you can fell ‘alone’ but I was so well looked after and treated sublimely.  The food... well! Certainly the best scallops dish I have ever had, and the main, the fowl, was superb, brilliantly well balanced and faultless.  I have to say my favourite course was the appetiser, a beautiful selection of country vegetables with the most incredible condiment.    Worth every penny, even the bread, and particularly the butter served with it, was truly a treat.    I truly fail to see how anyone could give a bad review, nor less than 5 stars. It was a memorable experience"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,All true lovers of food and wine ought to pay visits to the essence of Directing Master Alain Ducasse in Hotel de Paris,"3 star Michelin Restaurant Louis XV led by Alain Ducasse at Hotel de Paris, Monaco  It is always an outstanding practice to visit Louis XV, today with re-designed interior, more uplifted modern, but the same extraordinary, creativity from the genius chef-team back-stage in the kitchen. From the very moment you arrive in the hotel lobby you are welcomed and smoothly escorted to your table inside the main restaurant: Front–stage are more than two handfuls of skilful personnel ready to take care of the nearly twenty guests this mid-October lunch. Before, continuously throughout the Riviera lunch menu, and after very pleasant and well-balanced surprises kept coming as layers of evolving fountains of tastes and colour. The menu dishes itself was single masterpieces linked in the completeness of an unsurpassed food temple. All personnel around us operated smoothly (not to forget the many other experts in labour behind the curtain) they all worked like mercury shifts on their successful best ability to make our visit an exceptional tasting experience, comfortable and relaxing. But We have an expression “that roses do not exist without thorns”: Whenever you leave the table for e.g. the restrooms your cloth-napkins are taken away and cleverly folded and handed back to the table: Why don’t they give us clean ones instead of just folding the used ones? Summing up, all true lovers of food and wine ought to pay visits to the essence of Directing Master Alain Ducasse in Hotel de Paris, Monaco.  Best wishes and so long from Ole Michael Spaten"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,For a true Monaco experience,If you want to feel like royalty then dine here. This is by far the best service I ever got at a restaurant. I am not sure Queen Elizabeth gets this service at Buckingham Palace! So many little attentions pair with great food and a fabulous decor. Make sure to visit the jazzy bar just in front and of course finish your night at Casino Royale.    WARNING: This place will cost a fortune but to me it was worth it!

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Make sure you visit!,"Had the Riveria menu for lunch. Top 10 meals of my life, meeting the high expectations set by other Ducasse restaurants we've visited. Service and setting exemplary. Food sublime. Highlights included langoustine and minestrone entrees (who would have thought minestrone could be this good). The ornate rum baba ritual was great, quality petit fours and the local butter and oil was to die for. Wine pairing excellent value."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Splendid lunch,"A quick point to begin with. Do we talk about “value for money”? And what on earth does that mean in the context of 3* dining? Let’s just take the easy way out: we can compare the Louis XV against Guy Savoy, or L’Ambroisie, etc, but let’s not try anything more than that. During our stay in Nice, we ate at a number of restaurants at various price-points. We enjoyed wonderful meals at Bar des Oiseaux and Olive et Artichaut for a small fraction of the price of lunch at Louis XV. What to say? If you want a certain gastronomic experience, then pay your money and go for it. Don’t reflect too hard, it won’t do you any good. Enjoy.  So! The Riviera lunch menu looked very nice but we chose to eat à la carte. In for a penny!  The bread crisp with imprinted vegetables was a novelty and the little rolls of fresh vegetables with dip were refreshing. The main appetiser of a selection of local fish steamed over hot rocks was excellent, with a nice bit of theatre, and a beautiful dip.  Bread service was slightly odd. We were given one slice of (very good) sourdough. It was only when I asked for some more that we were offered a range of bacon, black olive and baguette. Not sure why we weren’t presented with these to begin with.  The wine list scales the heights very quickly! I found a Saint-Joseph at €130 which was absolutely delicious and pretty fair value I’d say. A positive mention also to the champagne and wine by the glass. The champagnes, plain and rosé, were excellent, as was the white Bourgogne we both had for our starters. Interesting to have only a choice of two by the glass but when one of them is a beautiful Chassagne-Montrachet for €25 (and a good pour) then I’m fine with that.  Starters: gamberoni, rock-fish gelée and caviar for me, and selection of vegetables with black truffle for my wife. The gamberoni is a magnificent dish, beautiful and refined. Gorgeous prawns, deeply flavoured gelée and three very nice dollops of caviar. A+. My wife’s vegetables and truffle was very good, lovely sized portion, beautifully presented. One reservation is that the truffle aroma wasn’t quite the magnificent hit of best winter truffle but - and I’m no expert here so I may be wrong - possibly another summer variation. Maybe the dish is better in November! Very lovely but just a little disappointing.  Mains were, for me, Mediterranean bass with focaccia, and for my wife, lamb with chickpeas. One of the lovely things I take away from this meal is the essential simplicity of the cuisine. There’s a delightful absence of foams and clouds and fragmentation. Those who expect the 3* experience to mean complexity and abstraction will be disappointed. But those who enjoy simple but fabulous ingredients, gorgeously combined, will be delighted. Two lovely pieces of bass resting on little pellets of focaccia, herbs strewn throughout, with the most wonderful lemon and mint condiment added at table. Magnificent! Such bright flavours, an absolute joy to eat. My wife’s lamb had a huge flavour, and was perhaps even more simply garnished. But lovely too.  My wife had cheese to finish while I chose the classic baba au rhum. Cheese was marvellous, the best Camembert we’ve tasted, practically running off the plate. Other selections were excellent too.  As for the rum baba - good grief, it really is stupendously good. One of those (again) very simple-seeming dishes that is elevated to wonderful heights. The vanilla cream is a thing of beauty! And good fun choosing the rum.  Various sweets and chocolates were lovely as was the coffee.  One other comment before finishing. Lunch or dinner? If we ever come back, we’d book for dinner. The restaurant was a little over half full this Friday lunchtime, and we thought the atmosphere suffered a bit. We can imagine things being a bit more fun / convivial in a full restaurant at dinner. All that space between tables is great, but it all works better in a full restaurant.  Service was lovely throughout.  Are we glad we went? Yes. Was it a marvellous meal? Undoubtedly. Was it worth it? See comments at start!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,10,HORRIBLE PERSONAL !,I want to say the food was nothing special and that lady the waiter was with horrible attitude how looked at the people also the other 1 waiter who was there but i dont take a picture of him. I having a big expectations for this restaurant but they fail because of the personal who act like they pay to you not you to them .... 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,Very good,"It's hard to give this a 5, as it's more of a four and a half for me. From the moment you step foot in the property you really sense you are inside one of the finest restaurants in the world. The dining room is exquisite, and the staff are extremely attentive, though a few did not really speak English, which made things a little difficult with discussion. The thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is that i just felt the food was lacking something vs the experience we've had in other 3 Michelin star restaurants. Of course with this kind of restaurant, your expectations are at their absolute highest, but i did feel it felt a bit short for me. It was a great dining experience still, and i would recommend anyone who is a fan of high end French cuisine to give it a go!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Amazing experience,"It was an amazing dinner with very nice people serving us and great food! I would definitely recommend it and please don’t eat nothing before, because you will have a lot of dishes to try and enjoy."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Inside this time,We learnt and had lunch inside.  Only one course needed to be changed to accommodate a completely vegetarian extended lunch menu. Swapped a prawn dish for a salad dish.  We wish we could afford to go more often it is very expensive but worth - spoil your selves.

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,By far the best restaurant I have ever tried!,"The least I can say is that it is impeccable: beautiful food presentation with exquisite tastes and knowledgeable staff. Every detail is looked into with utmost care. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and definitely an evening to remember."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Impeccable,"The only really great restaurant I had been to that is still working after 20 years I did not visit the Côte d’Azur. As it never disappointed me in my former visit it did not disappoint me this time either and I chose to eat both days I was in the region to eat here. The menu is very attractive and offers a great variety of interesting dishes. Everything I tasted - including the many amuse gueule and the sweets one gets gratis - was impeccable. Because I prefer seafood over meat I went both times for the seafood dishes; I liked not only the excellent quality of shellfish, lobster and langoustine: in general the cuisine of the restaurant offers exquisite vegetable side dishes. The a la carte prices seem still reasonable to me for this quality; in fact the menu for lunch is a bargain. Service is extremely polite and attentive. The surroundings are splendid, the presentation of the dishes, the tableware is beautiful: attention is paid to every detail. Surely the place to return to on my next visit."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Perfect place,It was one of the best places to enjoy dinner with friends and business partners.  Good Service level and tasty food might bring me back to this restaurant

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,3 Star Micheline Restaurant in Monte Carlo,"My husband and I were staying at Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo for a few days and decided to have lunch at Le Louis XV by Alain Ducasse before checking out. First of all, the sheer beauty of the room was striking. We did sit outside as it was a beautiful day but in hindsight, we should have sat inside. The tourists crowding the Casino Square was not as pretty as the main dining room. The Prix Fixe lunch was absolutely fabulous! And the service was immaculate with white gloved staff. When they brought out the crispy bread, it was so gorgeous that we just wanted to admire it as a work of art. The finger bowl with rose petals was the most beautiful I've seen and I loved the handbag stool which was made in maize leather to match the chairs. When we were leaving, they gave us a beautiful box containing a cake to take home and it was delicious (we had it the next day). What an experience and it was worth every penny!"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Speechless,"You know from the second you enter the establishment that you are in for a treat. We decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary here and were not disappointed.    The seasonal set menu lunch was fantastic with sufficient choice to accommodate different preferences. Service was impeccable.    Although the food, wine and service met all expectations it was the small touches that provides a lasting memory - the staff allowed us to pick our table in the opulent surroundings of the dining room but move to a second table on the terrace for dessert and coffee. The second nice touch was they presented us customised menus with the date and our course selections as a memory of the experience."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Absolutely incredible,"I ate here today and it was so good I thought I had to knock up the review quickly whilst the experience was fresh in my mind.  The Mrs and I had the tasting lunch at 12.30, it was quiet but we got a table overlooking the casino which was great for people watching.  The price was around 165 for the 3 courses which when looking at how they were individually prices was good value.  However, we got so much more than 3 courses.  Here's a little summary of what we had:  Amuse bouche - vegetable rolls with black olive paste. Chickpea crackers (excellent)  A selection of breads with oil and butter  Then we had a hot stone plate with steamed fish (excellent)  Starters were a tomato salad and minestrone vegetables  For the mains we had the bass and the guinea fowl  After that we thought it would be the deserts but no, we had a sorbet, a small salad and a selection from the cheeseboard.  Desserts were Apricot souflee with pistachio ice cream and the mrs took the fresh raspberries.    By this point we were pretty stuffed but our waiter (who was great fun) brought more sweets, chocolates and finally nuts. It was a truly massive meal.    The service was flawless and the whole experience was an absolute pleasure.  The bill came to 390 which was a bargain for what we had.    On the way out they gave us a leaving gift which was an fantastic touch."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,Excellent and as expected,"Monday, June 10, 2019 Dinner.  We were four persons (my family of three and a friend who joined us from London). We wanted to revisit this restaurant since it had been a few years after an excellent lunch here. Also, Mauro Colagreco’s Mirazur was on our list of places to try and we had a booking there for the previous evening.    Louis XV was excellent as expected.    The food was perfectly cooked and we enjoyed all courses. Good consistency.    We passed on Champagne and went with a Roulot Tessons 2013. It was fine. However, a well priced Rousseau Chambertin 2008 was very balanced and delightful.    We did not find any half bottle dessert wines so we just had a Climens 2005 by the glass.    Overall, an excellent dinner. I also liked the ease of making a booking here. And it wasn’t because i was a repeat customer. As I recall, it was just as simple and professional in years past.    I look forward to visiting again."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,Enjoyable fine dining experience,"We travelled to Monaco for a short break (without kids!) and we wanted to treat ourselves. The excellent service started when I contacted to restaurant about menu suggestions etc and had good email discussions and a phone call to follow up. On the evening itself, all the staff who we met were very attentive and knowledgeable. The gourmet tasting menu was certainly enjoyable and we sat (overlooking casino square) for three hours eating fantastic food. Overall we really had a great night"

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,50,One of the best meals of my life,"4 hours, 7 courses, 3 attendants, 1 spectacular meal. It's hard to put into words how good this meal is, but be prepared for the bill. With a wine pairing for each course, our group of 7 paid 800 euros per person. That being said, if you are in a position to spend that kind of coin on a meal for a special occasion, it certainly warrants the expense and actually on a per-hour basis the meal is 200 euros which is not all that unreasonable, especially when you factor in the wines that we drank. Also the setting is absolutely spectacular."

Le Louis XV - Alain Ducasse à l'Hôtel de Paris,40,Elegence with excellent service,"The service is excellent as one would expect in an Alain Ducasse restaurant, the food mostly traditional with only a bit of molecular gastronomy incorporated. Clearly a Michelin-2star level experience, maybe just sneaking over the boundary to a 3-star experience. The newly renovated, high ceiling, ornate dining room is magnificent and extremely well-done. It spacious and roomy and reminded us a bit of Ducasse's eponymous restaurant in the Plaza Athénée in Paris."

Le Cinq,50,This place deserves every award/star received. One of the best dining experiences in a long time.,"I was expecting to be underwhelmed for overpriced food, but was pleasantly surprised.  This place exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff is well trained and precise in their service. Food was exceptional. Over all experince was a 10/5. I don’t think I can remember the last time I enjoyed such an exceptional meal. Presentation, food, tastes, service, ambience, value etc were all incredible. Would recommend."

Le Cinq,50,A lifetime experience.,"We had an excellent dinner! The chef is a genius. His interpretation and handling of the high quality products is noticeable. The meal is expensive, however, it is extremely value for money. The generosity of the food and staff is big. Besides, the friendliness of the staff and their courtesy are the best. We would like to recommend this establishment."

Le Cinq,50,best of the best,"Simply put, the finest restaurant in the world. its like a beautiful ballet, a symphony if you will, and my wife and i just sat back and watched. how good was it? i almost wept at the end....because i didnt want it to end. one must have dish, is the spaghetti gratin, maybe the best pasta dish i have ever had. cozy beautiful dining room, over the top service, and fantastic food. you must go there at lease once in your life, it was worth every penny"

Le Cinq,50,Romantic Experience in Paris,"Everything was phenomenal and exemplary! The standout was the service, in particular Mr Franck Painchaud (restaurant assistant manager). He made the evening so romantic for us. He took a romantic photo of my wife and I holding hands, and slipped me a white rose to give to her while distracting her with a special birthday dessert. He said, I will make you look good - and he did. Michelin 3 stars service can be very formal, but the staff here were at times humorous and really put their patrons at ease. Oh, the food - Perfection! Beautiful and tasted amazing. We went with the A La Carte menu so we could try their signature ham and truffle spaghetti gratin - a must try dish. Also wonderful were the spider crab and prawn entrees, and the principle dishes of sea bass and salmon. So colorful and artfully presented. The dessert of wild strawberry with meringue, sake and yogurt was the perfect ending. Of course, the amuse bouches and chocolate trolley at the end of the meal were fantastic. When in Paris, this is the restaurant to have a romantic experience. Highly recommend that you consider Le Cinq for the food, the people and the ambiance. Stellar!"

Le Cinq,50,Unmatched service by Mr . Frank .,Unforgettable excellent service by Mr . Frank such a gentleman. Had a girls dinner and this gentleman took very good care of us explaining each course in detail gave us roses . Service unmatched . A restaurant I recommend if you love a luxury dining experience with value for money will definitely Return .thank you to the entire restaurant team you were so kind and a special Thank you to Mr Frank .

Le Cinq,20,How is this a 3 Michelin star restaurant??,"Having dined at Michelin restaurants around the world, it is safe to say that Le Cinq was not only the worst Michelin experience but also one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. While the room is lovely and the wine list is extensive, that is where it all ends. The food was just bad. All of our dishes had too much sauce and all of the hot dishes were served either at room temperature or were cold. The proteins were covered in so much sauce that you could not discern what you were eating. If the level of the ingredients is so high, why not let the meat or seafood shine on its own? The service was also well below even a one Michelin star standard. There were massive gaps in the service throughout the evening and once our mains were served, not a single person asked if we were enjoying the food. It was not until we sent back our food that a bit of attention was focused on our table. Shortly after that, our main waiter disappeared and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get the check. I could go on and on about the shortcomings…. Do yourself a favor and skip Le Cinq. It is simply not up to any Michelin standard and is resting on its laurels."

Le Cinq,50,It is a must!!,"Unforgettable experience!  Le Cinq dining area is very comfortable, very beautiful decorated and elegant!  From the starter dish until the desert was so flavorful yet beautifully presented, truly plating !  Combinations of flavors brought amazing taste to the palette, simply brilliant works of the Chef!  Five star for the sommelier and the service team! Everyone is very attentive and pleasant.  Serving and explaining every dish clearly and elegantly !  I and my partner was amazed by how everything moves efficiently yet harmoniously!  The director of the restaurant Mr Beaumard such a pleasant gentleman, he came to our table a few times to make sure that everything is going smoothly, truly a five star service, Thank you !    Dining at LE CINQ Paris has set our gastronomy experience bar high up.  Well deserved Three star Michelin !"

Le Cinq,40,Pricey but excellent food.,Excellent food. Rapid efficient yet friendly service. Beautiful decor set within the grand four seasons hotel. Creative menu but extremely pricey.

Le Cinq,50,Very good as one would expect,Very good as one would expect. We celebrated meeting up in Paris for the first time post pandemic. Well worth the wait. Le Cinq is one of 3 Michelin* restaurants at the George V. Le Cinq blessed with 3*. Great to enjoy all of them whilst staying here. Look out for quail + tonic water. Very good.

Le Cinq,50,Faultless In Every Way,"Restaurant Le Cinq is without a doubt one of the finest restaurants on Earth and must be visited by anyone in Paris looking for the best of the best from a restaurant.    The dining room is large and grand, set within the beautiful Hôtel George V. When a pianist is playing in the gallery next to the restaurant you can hear this as you dine, which makes for a very comfortable and enjoyable experience.    We started off with some canapés, the parmesan waffle being such a comforting thing with abundance of cheese flavour.    The bread then came which was a selection of baguette, olive bread and a bread with seeds which was almost pastry like, similar to a croissant for example. These were impeccable and served with great butter, I can’t recall having better bread anywhere than this.    All the dishes which followed were equally as impeccable as the bread we started with. I ate a gnocchi which melt in the mouth, the best I’ve had anywhere. The gratinated onions burst in the mouth to reveal a depth of flavour. The spaghetti timbale gratin was as decadent as can be, beautiful mushroom and truffle flavour and even topped with gold leaf. Cheese trolley was perfect. The desserts were all first class and the dessert trolley and the kouign-amann at the end of the meal with coffee was also fantastic.    Service was as attentive I’ve encountered anywhere, yet discreet at the same time. Everyone was extremely friendly and talkative towards us. I’d like to mention a gentleman who previously worked in Oxford that made our evening extra special. The service is akin to a fine Swiss watch, everything runs so smoothly and perfectly.    It is also worth noting that Le Cinq caters to vegetarians perfectly, so do please dine here if you don’t eat meat as you are guaranteed to eat one of the finest meals of your life.    I cannot wait to return and I recommend Le Cinq to anyone who wishes to dine in what I think is easily one of the best of the best restaurants on earth. Christian Le Squer and his chefs in the kitchen are a dream team.    A must visit!"

Le Cinq,50,Dining Perfection!,"We celebrated our 10th anniversary dinner last evening, and as always Le Cinq was perfection. The setting is so refined and beautiful - and the immaculate service begins the moment you arrive at the reception podium. The staff is simply incredible, you want for nothing - every need is met before you ask. On to the meal.    The menu is continually innovative - and as great as the menu selections are, the additive extras that just come along with your meal would be the envy of most other Michelin restaurants.    The wine menu is about the size of the King James Bible, with an incredible array of fabulous wines. Since the bride only drinks white, it was a 2020 Montrachet for her…just exquisite. Red for me, my favorite is a Chateauneuf-du-Pape - a 2016 was fantastic.    The meal itself was sublime. The Prawns starter, as well as the onion au gratin were just amazing. The wagyu steak and the lobster entrees were exceptional. We enjoyed a brilliant cheese course, and closed with chocolate that was world-class.    One thing I have to mention - when bread came around, one option was a flax seed bread. JUST HAVE IT. It’s perhaps the best bread I’ve ever eaten.    Let me end where I started, the food is brilliant - but the service is simply unmatched. Incredible combination. A must do."

Le Cinq,50,Wonderful Food and Great Service,"Had dinner at Le Cinq on a Saturday night. We had a fantastic time with the entire staff working there, in particular Yan (spelling?) who proivded us with not only amazing service but great conversation as well.    We did the tasting menu which was very good along with the wine pairing. In retrospect, I think we probably should have ordered a bottle of wine instead. I am gluten free and they did a great job of accomodating me.    A real great place to go to for a special occasion or just a special night out in Paris."

Le Cinq,50,AMAZING,"amazing food experience, the touch of the Italian chef gives the dishes a fantastic taste.  you need to try"

Le Cinq,50,Sumptuous,"Walking in is an experience. The fin de siecle splendor of the Four Seasons Hotel is a great setting for such a decadent dining experience. Gobelins, chandeliers, sky- high ceilings and plenty of gold transport you into the Belle Époque. Attentive waiters silently dart between the tables. The room sparkling with crystal and silverware seems hushed and yet buzzing with activity at the same time. You know then that this evening will be a celebration. Surprisingly though the first few amuses bouches were rather insipid (I don’t really understand why) - but don’t worry, once the real dishes are coming, things turn around very quickly. The high lights keep coming thick and fast, climaxing in an unsurpassable morel tartellete, so divine you will hear the angels singing as it melts in your mouth.  We were surprised to get our picture taking, which we received printed out in a card as we left - a rather luna-parkish moment a bit out of sync with the rest of the experience. For a moment the golden age feels gilded but don’t worry, the moment passes.  Overall we had a grand evening, full of culinary delights and enjoyed ourselves very, very much. Thank you to the sommelier for the informative conversation, and the chef, Christian Le Squer, who joined our table for a while, for his art."

Le Cinq,50,La crème de la crème,"One of the best restaurants I experienced.  The service is outstanding and felt welcome being solo dinner. Many extras amuse bouches, unforgettable experience. Even got a book of the 100 best restaurants signed by the team of the cinq.  Thank you for such amazing night"

Le Cinq,50,"WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. EAT HERE, YES EAT HERE!!!!",Le Cinq is inside the 4 seasons and the dining hall is fantastically beautiful. It seems like the kinda old fashion glamourös but I assure you the food is not. My guest and I selected the tasting menu and not one course disappointed. Everything was exceptional. The wait staff was exceptional. The price tag was exceptional $$$$$ so be prepared to spend around $1000.00 USD for tasting menu w/no alcohol. Oh but sooooooooooooooo worth the money and the experience. You cant get this kind of theater On Broadway!!!!    The meal never seams to end with delicious things keep coming to the table. Be prepared to part with 3 to 4 hours of time for this wonderful 3 star Michelin experience

Le Cinq,20,Underwhelming and uninspired,"We were looking forward to dining here for Christmas. It was a set menu for all tables that night. Unfortunately the dinner turned out to be one of the most uninspired, underwhelming meals we've ever had in any restaurant. The only course worth noting was the turkey, which was cooked well. Every other course was served without a thought spared for the balance of the dish, or perhaps lacking any thought put into it at all. Delicate scallops and sea urchin (beautiful on its own) just drowned and lost in a sour lemon yoghurt. Jalapeño in chocolate for dessert which was as pointless as it was tasteless.  The only things that worked well that evening - the wines, the sommeliers and the wait staff. The Christmas decor was reminiscent of a pleasure house with gaudy red lights lighting up the walls. Breads were served cold and very hard. Why? Even airlines serve their breads warmed.  All in all a very disappointing, exceptionally overpriced dinner that was worth nothing more than its name. And if this continues, even that may not be worth much.  Would not recommend."

Le Cinq,40,Disappointing!,"I have always wanted to dine here since 2017 when the restaurant was in its glory. We skipped it and went to Alain Ducasse which was disappointing as well. Came 2019, we skipped again and instead went to Pre Catelan (amazing!!) and L’Ambrosie- obnoxious!). So this time around, we skipped Epicure to dine here instead. I may have made the mistake, but inevitably, we have to dine here sooner or later.    I was very excited dining here for their tasting menu. Unfortunately, the food did not satisfied my curious palate. I can’t think of any dish that was worth noting. Instead, the last dish which was the smoked rice was so undercooked that I ate so little of it. Our server was so kind enough to replace it with another fish dish. The service was impeccable, however, all servers hurried along the dining room, almost in race which was stressful and distracting. I ended up not enjoying the experience. Been to more than a dozen 3 Michelin star restaurants and this is gotta be the most stressful I have even been in.    Please tell your servers to take it slow, no need to rush and place each dish on everyone’s table. Let your guess enjoy the ambiance, etc."

Le Cinq,50,Best in the world excellence,"Went in a very special occasion , it was my wife’s birthday , I don’t know from where to begin, mesmerized and amazed by the quality of everything, service, staff and the dinner hall is one of the worlds finest I am sure.  As for the food, flawless, extra ordinary and extremely tasty  Truly one of the best in the world  The salmon and the duck were my real winners , pretty expensive but worth every penny  Thank u le cinq for an unforgettable experience"

Le Cinq,50,Best in the World Experience,"There is definitely a reason this is a three star Michelin restaurant. First, every member of the staff fantastic. They all obviously love their jobs at Le Cinq and make you feel right at home - from greeting you right through walking with you out of the restaurant. Although extraordinarily high end, there is no pretentiousness - which is frankly missing at other Paris restaurants and is refreshing when you're spending that much money. The food is also amazing. Each time we have been we have chosen the prix fixe menu and have enjoyed every serving. Also an incredible wine list. I would never miss this restaurant on any trip to Paris!"

Le Cinq,50,Class and perfection.,"You get what you pay for. Over the top prices for an over the top experience. Stunning, multi million dollar dining room. Professional and attentive but not stuffy waitstaff. No detail overlooked. We were walking by the river before the lunch and my wife had on flats. They were whisked away into a velour bag while she put on her heels. A small tableside stool for her purse. Of course. Meal was indeed three Michelin stars. And enough dessert for another lunch. Just fabulous."

Le Cinq,50,Gourmet dining in true French style,"Enjoyed dinner here on a whirlwind trip to Paris. As guest at the Four Seasons, it was an easy elevator ride down to dinner. My friend described the dining room as the most beautiful room she has ever seen. The service was impeccable as we enjoyed the tasting menu with wine pairings. It is my sincere wish that everyone could at least once in their life enjoy the kind of meal that we had. It was perfectly portion, exquisitely paired with wine that enhanced each bite, and served with impeccable service and just a touch of humor by wonderful, wonderful staff. I hope to dine here again once the world recovers from the current coronavirus crisis. It was an unforgettable experience."

Le Cinq,50,Fantastic lunch w/ Chef Christian Le Sque,"Lunch at Le Cinq. Palace ambiance, yet approachable food and fantastic staff.    From the maitre d'hotel to the sommelier, waiter, assistant waiter and everyone else, everyone was engaging and kind, enhancing our experience and make our lunch absolutely memorable.    Food didn't disappoint. The four course lunch was exciting and well paced, with additional dishes in-between.    Wine list was surprisingly approachable. 2015 St Emilion for €75 was an excellent choice amid a list of 6,000 bottles.    Favorite dish was the lamb. Offals were fantastic, so nice to see these parts put at the center of the dish.    Sommelier offered us a glass of porto with dessert. Placed at perfect temperature (14 degrees celsius), it was exquisite and a perfect end to a fantastic culinary dream.    Chef Christian Le Squer who heads this Four Seasons restaurant came twice to check on us. Very kind."

Le Cinq,50,My favourite restaurant in Paris,"Fantastic service. Magical interior. The best wine list ever, they have wines that you won’t be able to find easily. The food was well presented and delicious. Such peaceful place as well."

Le Cinq,50,Worthy of Three Michelin Stars,"I cannot express enough what a perfect experience we encountered at LE Cinq.  The food was of utmost perfection. The sommelier was extremely knowledgeable in a very easy manner. The ambience is fit for a queen, and the flowers in the hotel and restaurant are simply gorgeous. Wonderful."

Le Cinq,50,Perfection all around,"What a temple of gastronomy!! All the details are take care of all around from the service, food, special touches and atmosphere. Expensive meal however a unique special experience"

Le Cinq,50,Amazing,"1st class food and service from start to end. This place is amazing, the staff are lovely and friendly and extremely attentive. I felt like a million dollars in this place. Nothing was too much trouble. I would highly recommend this place and would return in a heart beat. Thank you for making our time special."

Le Cinq,20,Disappointing,"We’ve very much enjoyed lunches at Le Cinq every time we’ve visited Paris over the past few years and we were really looking forward to returning. I can only say we were disappointed this time. The service in particular seemed disjointed with multiple different waiters and we didn’t feel ‘looked after’ at all. The amuse-bouche selection was delicious, the marinated scallop slices were nice, the lukewarm egg white soup was, to me, inedible (I only had a spoonful, the waiter wasn’t concerned at all), my main of pilaf rice was a smallish triangle of rice without much flavour (though I was told it contained truffles and it had a little foie gras sauce). All up, even with lots of offers of breads and some extras like chocolates and pre dessert, it wasn’t a menu to ‘celebrate’ the winter season (eg lukewarm soup, cold marinated scallops) and no real main course. I didn’t leave hungry but it was a very unexciting and unsatisfying lunch."

Le Cinq,20,We had lunch here as a family,"We had lunch here as a family of four in late December. The decor of restaurant and, of course the hotel, was quite stunning, elegant and seasonally festive. The service we received while dining was excellent from beginning to end, although I must say at times we felt that there were too many different servers flocking our table. The meals, however, were utterly disappointing, and even upsetting in retrospect. We opted for the à la cart items: the sea bass for my wife, the lobster for me, the spaghetti for the two little ones to share. A couple of small plates and breads came out while we enjoyed the champagnes we ordered and waited for the entrees to arrive. We took the sommelier’s recommendation for the wine pairings with the sea bass and lobster. Our kids, being 6 and 3 years old, couldn’t care less that we were at a fine establishment. They ate the spaghetti with grins and smirks because it didn’t look or taste anything like their usual spaghetti dish. My wife and I tasted the spaghetti and thought it was overpowered by the cheeses and shaved truffles. We were underwhelmed. I didn’t taste the sea bass but my wife thought it was”ok” and to me the presentation of the dish was a D- because the creamy sauce drowned the fish and made it disappeared—I guess fish belong UNDER the water (i.e. creamy sauce). The whole dish looked like a soup. Now the upsetting part: the lobster was nicely presented and the dish was creative but some lobster pieces were bland while most others were so wildly salty I could hardly swallow them. I came so close to sending the dish back but didn’t want to cause a scene, now regretting that I didn’t. I did not finish the dish and declined the desserts. This had been one of the few M* restaurants we’ve had the privilege to visit. Le Cinq was a bust."

Le Cinq,50,Exceptional!!,"Exquisite and memorable gastronomic experience we had at Le Cinq. We had the tasting menu and the food was exceptional. Plate after plate were unique and full of surprises with different flavors, textures and colors, and our dishes were beautifully presented. Restaurant ambience was classic and elegant. Service and staff were very pleasant, friendly yet attentive and professional (They took my 8 years old daughter touring their kitchen and gave her a chef hat!)."

Le Cinq,30,My spaghetti wasn’t amazing as I expected,"Great restaurant , service is amazing , Watching charming and good looking personal my dish was pasta - spaghetti 🦞 I forgot the name. I can’t tasted the spices, no salt,just a commune pasta. 😊😉"

Le Cinq,50,Out of this world.,"Outstanding food, beyond description, refined, delicate, mouthwatering. All kudos to Chef Le Squer. The sea bass was stratospheric in it’s taste and presentation- never tasted such perfection before. All the courses were amazing. Matthew and Homer made our celebration unique and personal."

Le Cinq,50,Excellent lunch,The service at this restaurant is just supreme. We had the tasting menu with paired wines. Food is exquisite and the wine choice with each course is finely balanced as the very best compliment.

Le Cinq,50,impressive,there is nothing here that I would change. Service was the best in paris. French food isn't my favorite but this was delicious. Wine offerings/pairings were extensive and delicious.

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,The Unique exquisite culinary experience in Singapore.🥂💎,"Best decision ever to choose this specific restaurant among many others in the Michelin Guide.    French cuisine with many japanese influences, perfect execution and presentation.    Taking into consideration its 10 years of existence (celebrated two weeks ago), I felt that 130€ for the 5-course menu was value for money.    Last but not least, ambiance, open kitchen and nicely carved walls, contribute greatly to the overall experience."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,"Innovation, Taste and Sincerely Friendly Service","Going to a Michelin starred restaurant, comes with high expectations and no more so than with this one! We had read people's past experiences and hope ours could match. Actually, our expectations were surpassed! The staff right from when Ms. Lovely met us and when Joseph introduced the menu and explained dishes along with his colleagues, we felt sincerely welcomed and treated with respect and patience as we asked questions and learned about the food! Most such restaurant staff are snooty and these people were down to earth! The food was sublime and yet innovative, most of all delicious! The rose butter was a bit overpowering but other than that the dishes were perfection the lamb was the best I have ever had but the more innovative drinks caught my eye in the mixed flight of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks! All in all a great experience!!!!"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Almost french,"We were last here when they first opened pre-covid and pre-michelin star. This time, good impressions all round    Good service throughout. There’s a 5 or 7 course menu choice. Standouts include the fish and pork mains. Interesting the chef included some asian ingredients in this very french restaurant - laksa leaf, coconut, kueh pieti etc."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",20,Baffling.,"I really hesitate to leave bad reviews, as I am aware that they can potentially have a negative impact for a business. But unfortunately our recent experience at this restaurant demands one. We have eaten at 1, 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants around the world and I’m still bemused by our meal at La Dame de Pic.    Positives first: the staff were excellent. Charming and informative. Big tick there.    The look of the restaurant itself is chic too. And the matching wine/sake/beer etc option was interesting and very well presented by the sommelier.    These are the only reasons I’ve given 2 stars in this review.    But the food…it really was not good. After a decent start with the amuse bouches, the courses got worse and worse. It’s as if no one in the kitchen is actually tasting the food. The approach seems to be to take French cuisine and crash it into individual, mismatched, overly concentrated/distilled elements of Asian cuisine. I get that the French-Asian combination is the concept of the restaurant, but every course was over-powered with jarring kaffir lime, citrus, pepper or anchovy/pungent fish flavours - including seemingly each desert! We are adventurous eaters, but some of the courses were virtually inedible. Presentation was generally very good. Flavours were not.    When we mentioned to our waiter that we hadn’t enjoyed a particular course, it seemed that he was able to immediately identify why (ie what elements of the dish didn’t work), without us having to explain. My impression was that he’d either tasted the dish in question and agreed with us and/or had heard the same complaints before!    One more gripe for the restaurant - please don’t bring a trolley with digestifs to the table without any indication of price. It’s embarrassing for your guests and feels like a grift. My wife asked jokingly if we would have to mortgage our house if we selected something. The waiter said something vague about prices not being unreasonable then asked for our order. We took him at his word, but the cost added to the bill for the 2 digestifs was far from reasonable, imho.    By way of comparison, the week before our meal at La Dame de Pic we ate at a 1 Michelin star restaurant in Edinburgh (Restaurant Martin Wishart) with a group of 4. Tasting menus all round and matching wines for 2 of us at the Edinburgh restaurant. Clearly, cost isn’t everything, but the total bill at the Edinburgh restaurant for 4 of us was $500 less than the bill for 2 of us at La Dame de Pic. And the food at the Edinburgh restaurant was truly delicious. A complete contrast to our experience in Singapore.    As I mentioned at the start, I don’t like leaving bad reviews. I don’t often leave reviews on TripAdvisor and most of the reviews I do leave are overwhelmingly positive. But with a bill of almost Sing$2k for food the often tasted unpleasant, this restaurant literally left a bad taste in my mouth.    It’s always a risk that you won’t enjoy the food at a particular restaurant - particularly those that attempt to innovate- and generally that’s a risk we are prepared to take, as we love food. But there is a difference between challenging/innovative food on the one hand, and bad flavour combinations on the other. Based on our experience, I simply cannot recommend this restaurant.    And as a final thought - if any readers of this review are wondering why we didn’t complain more strongly when we were there - honestly, we couldn’t see the point. Based on what was coming out of the kitchen, we felt that any replacement/alternative courses would have compounded the issue. And I have no doubt that any complaint would have inevitably ended up in an uncomfortable and lengthy discussion/dissection of our experience. By the end of the meal we were simply exhausted and wanted to leave."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,"Outstanding Food, Ambience and Service",Outstanding. From the first mouthful you will understand why it is deserving of the Michelin star. Every course was thoughtfully prepared. Flavours worked well together and plating was just so beautiful. Service was impeccable. We could not find any flaw with this restaurant.

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",30,"Good, but not good enough..","This is one of my father's favorite restaurants, having tried LDdP in both London (the original) and here (Sg). We thus went for the ""experience"", and - indeed, were off to a promising start: amuse bouche succeeded in amusing, two mocktails were quite nice. The tomato was definitely the highlight of the evening. But, alas, was also where things started dropping.    The berlingots, while admittedly ""aggressive"" (per our waiter), were simply bad. The fish gave us hope, but the two mains - chicken and beef were simply subpar. Not at all what my father had come to expect, or - for that matter - what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The Mille-feuille (signature) was likewise disappointing.    This is not to say that LDdP is a bad restaurant - far, far from it. The staff is the usual kissing-up type you'd expect with Michelin. However(!) for the price ($248 SGD pp, amounting over $700 when cocktails etc were factored in), I can't say it was justified.    De gustibus non est disputandum, but at the end of the day - especially having been there before for meals that were off the charts - this time, La Dame did not live up to, or merit its hype."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Very very elegant and stunning display of French cuisine,"If you are looking for a spot on French dining. Just have them here. Service and presentation of the food, true to what you usually see on a 3 star restaurant."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Great Culinary Experience not to be missed,"Great culinary experience with my friends. Truly an experience not be missed and rich ambience of the restaurant further enhanced rich flavors of the food.    Superbly impressed by food which was as beautiful as art as well as the taste of food! Even for a hearty eater like myself, the lunch portions were far more than adequate.    Staff was very patient in explaining all beautifully plated foods and my friends and I were suitably impressed by food served. Pictures shown by other reviewers truly depict the care, passion and love Chef has for serving her customers"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Fantastic 60th birthday celebration,Everything was perfect. It made us so happy that we made a promise to go back everytime we are in Singapore. Truly deserving of more Michelin stars

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Excellent dining experience!,"We thoroughly enjoyed the food and commend the excellent service, especially coming from Marta and team! Thank you for an unforgettable evening!"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,"Excellent food, ambiance, service, attitude, generosity, quality","Our special anniversary dinner @La Dame de Pic in Raffles Singapore tops our worldwide experience in fine dining and modern contemporary sustainable French cuisine. Madame Pic, the entire kitchen and front line staff must be congratulated. The food, ambiance, decor, concept, attitude, generosity and quality of service was second to none. Singapore and Raffles should be proud to host Madame Pic and share her experience with everyone. We will be back soon! We loved the vegetable garden just outside the premises, and urge all other diners to have a viewing of this amazing work. Thank you."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,"Class Act as good as 3-Michelin Star Experience if not better. Classy, Sublime, Subtle, sans Theatrics & Non-essentials.","Having spent my travelling dollars for the past 1.5 year on local fine dining, I count my blessings having tasted all 3 & 2 Michelin-stars, plus some 1 star restaurants in Singapore.    That said, my visit on 1 July to La Dame De Pic (awarded 1 Michelin-star in 2022. Congratulations!) was no less awe-inspiring than those which I have experienced in our 3 Michelin-stars restaurants, in terms of the hospitality, ambience and experience of engaged senses. The curated menu showcased the Chef's finesse and creativity in marrying flavors of ingredients, herbs and spices from different cultures.    The service rendered was welcoming and hospitable. The service team was attentive yet non-intrusive, unlike some restaurant whose service team may be pressured to upsell beverages and additional course. I ordered a glass of saké and the head sommelier recommended me a very good brew. He graciously offered a tasting glass of a different brew under the same brewery to pair with my dessert when I finished my sakè before the dessert.    I ordered the 5 course Experience menu at $248++/pax. Every course on the menu was very well executed, but my favourite among the 5 has to be the starter Amela Tomato, which is confit tomato with smoked burrata, *chou cao, and mint sauce vierge. I loved this slightly more than the Summer Sweet Tomato I have had at Jaan. I have always been adverse to any ingredient from sheep, lamb or goat. However the Chef handled the harsh gameyness of the goat's burrata by lightly smoking it, leaving just an occasional slight teasing note to tickle your palette when u bite onto the juicy plump refreshing fruit. I absolutely would revisit solely just for this course.    It was my partner's birthday and we were presented a yummy birthday cake without the need of a reminder.    I would definitely revisit La Dame regularly as this will be my favorite among those I have visited. For the gustatory experience, I would consider La Dame de Pic menu to be well worth its price.    *Chou Cao, transliteration of Asian herb 臭草, translate to mean smelly grass. Commonly used as an ingredient in local dessert green bean soup as it has a 'cooling effect' and it is believed to reduce bodily heatiness when consumed in our hot and humid climate. Pregnant women are advised against consuming it though."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",30,Promises much but doesn’t deliver !,"This is another example of a big name chef using their name in another country which disappoints .  The venue is great, staff were friendly and helpful. Also attentive.  The food looks pretty but the restaurant pretends and charges like it i a 3 star Michelin. However that’s were the similarity ends. The food lacks flavour and character . Nice ingredients with lots of technical skill applied but there is very little wow in how it tastes. It’s all very bland . Out there f the 5 courses and all of the little tastes they give only a couple of dishes stood out and they were great. The tomato with burrata promised a lot and I thought this is going to be a great dinner but sadly not .  House wine at $sg40 is nice but over the top.  This is the last time I will go to a big name chef restaurant where the name isn’t there to oversee the standards .  Just the name on the door doesn’t justify the price especially in Singapore where there is so much great cooking."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",30,"Quite disappointing, poor service","I was not planning on writing a review but given the restaurant could not be bothered to respond to a polite feedback letter, this is the letter we sent them.    Dear La Dame Pic    We would like to express our disappointment at a highly anticipated meal today. We are not looking for recompense, simply providing feedback in a private way. We have no desire to share this on social media.    My son and I have been fortunate enough to visit most of the World’s 50 best restaurants as well as multiple 2-3 starred restaurants around the world. We have been in Australia for the past 2 and a half years, unable to leave and enjoy international fine dining again. Needless to say we were delighted to be able to leave Australia and to have a gourmet holiday in Singapore. We have had wonderful experiences at Ms Pic’s establishments elsewhere before so for his birthday my son asked to go to La Dame Pic, choosing it over Odette and Les Amis(Thankfully we have reservations for both next week anyway).    As our meal progressed I was perplexed when the waiter asked me if I ate breakfast as he thought I was eating quickly. I have never had a wait staff ask me such a thing, anywhere in the world. For what it’s worth we thought the service seemed rushed- perhaps I do eat quickly but that doesn’t mean I want each course rushed out in rapid succession.    Visually everything was as expected, though we only truly enjoyed one of the amuse bouche(the scallop). I didn’t particularly enjoy the uni and the John Dory was rather bland. The major disappointment was the Iberico Pork which was very tough. Your waiter did offer to replace it but by then we had eaten most of it and did not have much appetite to have another course. The palate cleanser had a bitter taste to it and the cream cheese pre dessert was rather unusual, and not in a good way.    The desserts were much better, in particular the mille feuille. The Rhubarb blossom dessert was visually beautiful but a little too sour for my liking.    We did enjoy my son’s birthday cake.    I seldom write to a restaurant after a meal- in fact I think this is only the third time. I would like to see you succeed. But a 60-70% full restaurant over a long weekend where it is virtually impossible to get a table at any of the leading restaurants in Singapore, as well as similar general feedback from colleagues of mine who also enjoy fine dining speaks for itself.    I trust you will take this criticism constructively in the way it is intended and I wish you well for the future."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,A MasterClass of the Sublime,"This is a restaurant that merits its stars. Chef Sophie Pic and her team have created a magical experience in the heart of Singapore. The food is of a high quality and the service is excellent. The setting is impressive, without being imposing or overbearing. This is luxury and haute cuisine, without any snobbery."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,A Highlight of Our Raffles Experience,"We were not disappointed. We loved the whole experience and we will definitely be back! The ""snacks"" were a nice touch."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",10,Food did not meet expectations,"Total meal for 2 with a bottle of wine was over $800 (nett of discount vouchers). Meal felt rush … the canapés were out before we placed our orders. Total of 6 courses of which only 2 met our expectations. Considering the experience, we felt shortchanged"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Stunning place with scrumptious dishes! Do go if you would like to eat with all your senses.,Wonderful experience! My friend and I were sat on a beautiful couch facing the garden and the room and we were advised delicious wines to pair with the succulent food by a Japanese lady who was not only knowledgeable but extremely pleasant. Each dish was scrumptious and beautifully presented on gorgeous plates! A must in Singapore

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,A birthday to remember,Visited for my birthday and the experience was definitely memorable for the best reasons.    Service was friendly and staff made me feel truly welcome. They were also knowledgeable about all aspects of the dishes and drink pairing.    Am very grateful La Dame De Pic offered bon alcoholic drinks pairings as I do not enjoy alcohol. The various infusions went beautifully with the amuse bouches and dishes.

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,More than a picture perfect meal,"This French fine-dining restaurant by a female 3-Michelin-starred chef Anne-Sophie Pic is the go-to place for a romantic meal.    Located in the iconic Raffles Hotel, with its high ceiling and French windows, one may forget for a moment that you are dining in Singapore. With each item served looking so perfectly put together and never failing to impress in taste, the dining experience is very enjoyable and made even more complete with their excellent service."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,One word....... AMAZING,Thank you for such a fabulous dinner! Very very highly recommended. Indulge and have the main tasting menu! worth every dollar!

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Can't Believe This Dinner is in Singapore!,"We have dined at Noma - Copenhagen, Restaurant KOKS - Faroe Islands (in 2015 before they won any awards internationally & got their first Michelin star), Marc Fosh - Palma de Majorca & Moments - Barcelona amongst other notable restaurants around the world and we couldn't believe we had this gem in Singapore - in our own backyard!    Indeed a Michelin star quality restaurant from the minute we entered, it was magical dining again in the midst of a worldwide COVID pandemic - grounded from travelling for more than 1.5 years.    Worth every penny for the Elegant Dinner Set - for me the jewel was Jacque Pic's iconic 1971 creation - wild sea bass swimming in a champagne froth with only the caviar peeping over the frothy ocean. Visually in black and white but tastewise - absolutely heavenly! Compliments to the Chef(s)!    Another worthy mention is for the sommelier for his remarkable wine pairing & his sharing commentary and discussion. We loved the wines and sakes selected.    The plating was meticulous and each mouthful of the Hokkaido scallop carpaccio evoked the awakening of different tastebuds with each delivery.    The attention of all the wait staff and their quiet setting and clearing of the table was appreciated. Our server was well versed with all the dishes description as well as engaging in our discussion of expectations.    All in all, a wondrous birthday gift from our dear friends who know how much we miss travelling and exploring foods all over the world......"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",30,Pretty plates but!!,"We were very excited and looking forward to an amazing dinner when we arrived. The ambience and service was great. So were the seats- firm with good back support! A rare comfort that we appreciated. We tried one of the different set menus each so we could appreciate the chef’s special touch. However as the dishes were rolled out, we were sending back many unfinished plates/cups to the kitchen, and by the time it came to dessert, the staff simply removed our half eaten plates without asking what we did not like about them. The food contained much vinegar, tea, some coffee, and was a blend of many herbs and leaves that did not sit well with our taste buds. We also appreciate a good night’s sleep daily, so when the dishes included tea and items made with coffee, we could not eat/drink them. A few items were just too sour! So the evening turned out disappointing and sad. A suggestion to the chef: do inform your guests that your dishes contain much vinegar, tea and coffee, so they can respond accordingly, and enjoy a meal customised to their dietary preferences. We had enjoyed many French meals before and did not have to suffer such discomforts. That said, the pigeon and lobster were good."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,A very enjoyable BD dinner!,"Restaurant is located within Raffles Hotel.    We went for Elegance degustation, costing $348 each. Price is a bit on the higher side but feel is worth it; it has excellent restaurant accolades in France and serves a massive number of pretty looking dishes.    Love all the dishes, but particularly so for the amuse bousche, Berlingots, and sea bass (created in 1971)!    Staffs were very professional and friendly. Would love to come back. Thanks for celebrating my BD!"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Marvelous dining experience,"From the moment we set foot on the premises, everything was fabulous! A kind doorman escorted us to the restaurant and took pictures of us in the hotel gardens. The restaurant is beautiful and service was amazing. The menu dégustation was absolutely phenomenal in taste and artistic looking. Chef Kevin Gatin came to chat with all the guests which we appreciated. Special thanks to Justin, Allan, Janet and Bliss who when out of her way to let us try the famous strawberry rose petal jam. Thanks too to all the kitchen staff for making such beautiful and tasty dishes."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,La Dame de Pic a true adventure,"La Dame de Pic a true adventure down the culinary path of haute cuisine. 3 Michelin without the pretension by staff or patrons. Chef Kevin Gatin, Chef Anne Sophie Pic’s protégé does a superb job with his creations. Fundamentally beautiful to the eye while pleasing to the palate. His attention to detail goes beyond the culinary to the evocation of its presentation for example an homage to the forest from which the lamb was frolicking in the Pyrénées. The experience doesn’t stop there but once placed in the mouth the textures and temperatures come to play against each other for the truest of culinary sensations. Hitting the mark on the senses. What one expects from true craftsmanship. A mastery of one’s craft without pretence and arrogance. EXQUISITE."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",40,Certainly a truly fine food experience,"Certainly fine food. Before everything, the very first impression is the restaurant room temperature which is far too cold. We had to request blankets and put them on our knees and even around my neck not to get sick. It is truly not comfortable to have such a long dinner in a cold space. We were told it is a central air conditioning for the hotel but the management has to do something really. Friends warned us indeed but as I am not sensitive I thought I could make it but no.. Ears and nose remained cold until we came out. Hopefully the Elegance menu was enjoyable with high and low lights though. Starting with lows, surprising that we were told it would take 20’ to get a Martini before we start our dinner.. We had to regret it. The chocolate based desert is not up to 2 stars standard and the brie de Maux cheese with vanilla is really so so. The truffle was not so tasty and odor full and the poularde a bit too dry. On the plus side, we really enjoyed the sea urchins and the berlingots as well as the quality of the beef. We selected a very nice Chateau Simone Cotes de Provence red 2015. Need a bit more efforts on some and the dishes and the 3rd Michelin star is not that far... Heat it up!"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Endgame to ‘M-Star’ League SG,Above and beyond MasterChef experience! All senses blown away...speechless! Way above the 5 dots... and there should be a superstar grade in Trip advisors and I will hit that!!    Really BEST by far among those that are M-Star graded Restaurants in Singapore!    When budget allows I will be back again and again!

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",30,Average food for the price tag,"We went for the Elegance Menu. Overall the experience was very pleasant. But unfortunately the food wasn’t to both my husband and my liking. The dishes we really really really enjoyed were the starters and palate cleansers 😂. The rest were really average for us. Everything tasted very clean and light and had the same kind of texture. If that’s your kind of thing you may enjoy it. I prefer a lot more flavour and texture to my food. I also wished for a bit more experimental kind of food. Eg, the mushroom dish was a bit meh. I wished they did more to bring out the different textures and flavours of mushroom. But maybe then again, every chef has their own pattern. Service was good, the service staff were polite and all, but when they served or cleared anything they would criss cross their hands over the table. Slightly intrusive and something I wouldn’t expect at a fine dining restaurant. Although I’m not generally bothered about such stuff, if I’m paying over $300 per pax for a meal, I do expect exceptional over the top service."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Our anniversary staycation at Raffles,The ambience is conducive to fine dining. The service is excellent. Food is a feast for the eyes as well as the belly. The chef tries to introduce new flavours so bound to have a few misses but tolerable. It is a classy restaurant so the price reflects it. Stay in guest get discount of 15% and there is possibly card discount. Excellent choice for celebrating a special occasion.

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,That fish dish!,"It was a delightful and wonderful journey of a meal that we had when we decided to visit the restaurant on the last day of october 2020. Except for the entry where we were not able to visit even the hotel lobby, the staff within the restaurant were informative, helpful and attentive, while giving you the space to have your private talk in between dishes.    The wait between each dish was brisk and the attention to detail to each dish is impeccable. The amuse bouche had a few surprises, with the chef fusing some local delicacies with a touch of complexity. Their signature berlingots was wow to say the least with each bite into the pasta parcel was just perfect, the texture of the pasta complemented the temperature and taste of the cream cheese within. The biggest wow of the night was the turbot, a dish with different accompaniments on the same plate, the fish itself had a firm yet juicy texture and the consomme that came with the dish made us want to lick every drop of it. But the foam added another dimension to the the dish, not to mention the smoked mushrooms, as well as the kelp (i think) made it one of the best, if not the best fish dish I probably ever had in my life. The beef as well as the poularde was great, and their signature dessert together with the petit fours left us satiated and comforted of money well spent.    It is simply a matter of time before they get their michelin stars, so I would certainly visit again when I can!"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,One of Singapore's best Fine Dining Experiences,"We visited La Dame de Pic twice in the past few weeks: Once for dinner and once for lunch. Our expectations were not only met but exceeded due to a combination of the following points:    1.) The Design: 36 seats in a light and relaxing atmosphere. Our dinner was in the semi private niche seating area that feature a long bench. The only downsides for this location are air flow (it is a bit warm) and communications between 4 people is a bit difficult as the table is fairly long. However, the main dining room features comfortable chairs and ample space all around. The only real negative on the design side is actually outside the dining room: the restrooms are part of the Raffles Hotel and on both visits we experienced poor cleanliness and bad odor that suggest plumbing issues (our assumption is that this is a hotel issue rather than the restaurant as those restrooms can be accessed by the public as well). A better solution would be to provide dedicated restrooms for La Dame de Pic customers to complement the ambiance of dining room.    2.) The Team: The service team under the leadership of June performed very well. Throughout both meal experiences one could feel the high level of motivation and service focus of the team based on quality training and a sound understanding of their product (every dish and its preparation). Besides being professional, the team was friendly and relaxed which is important when it comes to fine dining as the experience turns otherwise into a very stiff and formal exercise. The sommeliers did a fine job on the beverage side complementing the food service very well.    3.) The Food: We sampled the 7 course menu for dinner and the 3 course menu for lunch. Those courses are supplemented by many little add on delicacies. And there is the bread....an indulgence by itself. You could just eat bread...more bread and then again..more bread....so yummy. But don't do that: And why you ask... because every single dish served after the excellent bread is outstanding (save some bread to soak up the delicious sauces).    Presentation is crucial in fine dining and La Dame de Pic does an outstanding job creating art pieces that become instant social media hits and taste delicious.    In summary: A fantastic choice for a special day out. Given the overall experience that can only be ranked as world class."

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",50,Outstanding food and service!,"On a staycation at the Raffles, we decided to try out La dame de pic las t night, a good decision for sure!  We had a wonderful experience! Everything was outstanding, chic but warm service, the food wad full of flavours and the menu was a symphony played to perfection!  I will definitely come back again and again....  Bravo to the chef and the staff! Keep the same quality please!"

"La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore",30,Expensive and disappointing,"I was very exited to have Lunch at La Dame de Pic for my birthday, but I was disappointed with the food and the reaction of the French Chef when we told him that we were not really satisfied!  Good service and good presentation. Amazing place!"

PIC,50,PIC: A Culinary Journey at the Highest Level,"Some of the dishes that I particularly enjoyed included the sea urchin with caviar, the pigeon with black truffle, and the white chocolate dessert with passion fruit. I had a truly unforgettable dining experience at PIC. It is a restaurant that I would highly recommend...More"

PIC,50,3 stars Michelin and deserved,Gourmet dining par excellence with an amazing wine menu. Having such a great and in depth wine menu it would be good if the menu could be sent ahead of the visit for guests to prepare and choose some bottles ahead of the visit.

PIC,50,Beyond words,"One of a kind experience we lived at Pic last August. Not only the service was perfect, but the food was absolutely mind (and senses) blowing. Everything, from A to Z, was subtile, unexpected, incredibly well balanced and obviously, delicious. A journey we wont’ forget!"

PIC,50,Absolutely delicious,This is the second time I have dined here. And it is still fantastic. Every dish were so beautiful and delicious. I wish I live in France so that I can dine again and again.

PIC,50,Lovely birthday lunch!,"Perfect place to spend an amazing lunch for a special occasion. The food, the service, the place is without question high level. We felt welcomed and the ambiance is really peaceful and friendly and for sure professional. We would love to come back anytime!"

PIC,50,"High quality, original, and creative cuisine in a beautiful setting.",Spectacular original and creative cuisine in a beautiful setting with wonderful service. The wine pairing was extremely high quality.

PIC,50,WOW,Long awaited moment and it didn’t disappoint. Perfection in every plate; professional but warm service; creativity and tradition . Automatically in my top 3 of the best restaurants I’ve ever been

PIC,50,A meal at Maison Pic,"Everything is just perfect: from the taste, to the visual of the dishes, the service, the environment end the nice furnitures in the room."

PIC,50,Amazing experience,"We enjoyed a superb meal at Pic. Each dish seemed to surpass the previous. The service was impeccable, a perfect balance of attentive and friendly without being intrusive. I could not recommend Pic highly enough for a special celebration, a truly unique experience."

PIC,50,JUST PERFECT!,"As i have posted on my fb page, everything here is an art: the place, the food and the wine. The service was excellent, bravo to all the staff! My husband and I appreciated so much that we were invited to have a moment in their kitchen as i have already visited different top chefs' kitchens in the past. We were honored of having this experience. Nothing more to say but: Perfect! Bonne Continuation à Vous!  ARLENE ARRAGON"

PIC,50,A perfect meal,"We knew our visit to Maison Pic was going to be special even before we got there. The reservations staff took the initiative to contact us about several details, including making sure that they had my wife's name correct for her birthday celebration. Once we arrived, everyone we encountered made a special effort to ensure that we had a wonderful experience.    When we arrived for lunch, we were ushered into their beautiful garden for a glass of champagne and some amuse bouche. Each group of diners has their own private space in the garden making this a wonderful way to being the meal and get your taste buds ready for the main event. Later, we went to the dining room where the tables are nicely spaced to give each group some privacy while also creating the enjoyable environmental buzz of a room full of people enjoying delicious food.    As expected, the food was fabulous. Each dish accomplished the chef's goal of bringing out the tastes and flavors of the underlying ingredients. There was a great mix of foods so that each course created a bit of a surprise. We ordered the wine pairings which were very well selected and made the meal even better.    We stayed overnight and I must say that the rooms were wonderful. After a five-hour meal, it was so nice to be able to go for a short walk and then retire to a beautiful and very comfortable room.    I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. It is expensive, but the full experience is worth it. The combination of wonderful, attentive staff, a beautiful setting, and incredible food makes Maison Pic the perfect place for a meal. If Michelin ever decides to give out four-stars, this place will be one of the ones selected."

PIC,50,"A long-awaited family pause at Maison Pic, Valence","Everything was fantastic from the ultra smooth check-in process and the hotel, the comfort of the rooms, the welcome at the restaurant and the explanation about the culinary journey prepared by the chef, the wine-food pairing proposal, very original and well-thought, and ultimately of course the climax of the day, the meals all exceptional, in beauty, originality and of course taste."

PIC,50,Fantastic experience,"What to say, it was simply perfect, great food as expected, friendly and very professional staff. All started in the garden with a great cocktail in a peaceful atmosphere. I do recommend the option to match the dishes with the drinks, which is very well done and explained."

PIC,50,Truly special in the most unexpected way.,"Our third visit to Maison Pic over 19 years and the most special of all.  Our room, a Deluxe Double, was stylish and comfortable, just the right size for an overnight stay, with an excellent bathroom.  The outdoor area for pre-dinner drinks is furnished with casual flair and the soft clubbing music in the background set the tone of a visit here, where life is to be enjoyed with a sense of fun.  The beautifully-appointed dining room is more elegant and formal but the highly professional staff remain warm and friendly at all times.  There is a mandatory 10-course menu for all diners: we very much enjoyed the first three courses, in particular a mind-blowing beetroot creation, but to impress the diner through 10 courses seems an impossibility for even the best chef and their team.  What made our evening extra special was a tableside chat with Anne-Sophie Pic, followed by an invitation to view the kitchen and then to eat one of our courses at the ‘chef’s table’! Again Anne-Sophie Pic spent long periods chatting with us, in between supervising the creation of dishes by her assistant chefs. What a very special evening.  A pleasant, though fairly ordinary, breakfast was taken in the courtyard dining area, and a warm goodbye from reception staff confirmed the tone of our entire, wonderful visit."

PIC,30,Not up to previous standards,"- No ""a la carte"" food. A single tasting menu which makes it very long for a minimum of 3 hours and half service.  - Slow service, with a too long wait (15-20mn) between the many courses. You start digestion before the next course is served  - I would suggest to have a second shorter menu  - The quality of the food was fine but not to the usual standard.  - Having known the place run by the father, I would suggest to rename the restaurant just “Anne Sophie” as both cuisine are completely different with their own personal imprint.  - We got a very good impression of Anne Sophie Pic, when she came to visit each table in the dining room, as she has charm and a kind personality"

PIC,50,A 360 sensorial journey,"I am happy to write this review because it was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a Michelin restaurant, where the bar and expectation is already high since your arrival.  In this case, we also stayed at the hotel so it was clear for us to see that service excellence and culinary mastery is part of the culture of Anne-Sophie Pic hotel & gourmet restaurant. As they describe it, it is a full journey and experience where you feel welcomed and pampered since the very moment you arrive covering all aspects:  - The hotel and restaurant team is perfectly dressed, charming & smiley, bi-lingual (in Fr & En) and 100% oriented to service and make you feel special  - The decoration is impecable. Very unique and original pieces all around, from the rooms, to the pool, to all the restaurants, specially the main gourmet restaurant. Truly gorgeous, modern, but cozy  - The food & wine list across the board is outstanding - from breakfasts, to cocktails and drinks in mid-afternoon to an immersive food journey from a 3 Michelin stars and only female Chef in France with this qualification like Anne-Sophie Pic, this is a restaurant the redefines the standard and close relationship between Services + Food + Wine (I am a sommelier myself, so I have a special appreciation for the level of detail this full operation is run)."

PIC,50,Food & beyond,"This culinaire experience was beyond my expectations. The food, so much flavor and the imagination was just amazing. The service was impeccable. This restaurant is a must!!"

PIC,50,Exceptional cooking,"This a wonderful restaurant that lives up to expectations. We did have to wait a bit in the lounge for drinks but I forgive them for that!  The menu is exceptional and worthy of three stars, a taste sensation and just thoroughly enjoyable.  My rejection of the recommended wine upon tasting was dealt with sensitively and an alternative offered quickly and correctly with minimal fuss.  The food was interesting and beautifully presented with little tasters in between courses. There were a couple of occasions where language hindered explanations but someone always came back to answer our questions about ingredients. If only I could cook like this!  Great to see Anne-Sophie at the end and lovely to talk to her and have the menu signed.  An expensive night out certainly but as the price is set you know exactly what you are letting yourself in for. certainly a night to remember ."

PIC,50,delicacy and personality,"A wonderful culinary journey filled with delicacy and powerful. 10 dishes, 10 different surprises. French excellence with a lovely Japanese inspiration. Anne-Sophie & Co, you made my day when you came to us discussing about tea + gastronomy. Enjoyed the moment, many thanks. Fred"

PIC,50,Superb,"A fantastic experience. The food was perfect and amazing. A superb wine list and incredible, attentive and friendly staff. I could not recommend a visit more highly."

PIC,50,Well deserved 3 star,"Forking over a grand to wine and dine for two is no flippant matter to this nonoligarch and I assume also to fair number of potential patrons who research with diligence before doing so. There are detractors here and there but I can’t be counted amongst them. Mich 3 dining is razor’s edge stuff - missteps and lackluster dishes quickly sour the experience as the expectations and outlay are so high. We thankfully experienced no such disappointments. Dining space was impeccable- comfortable, formal yet not a in hushed funeral home kind of way , softly surfaced, appropriately lit, soothing color palette - in sum a very nice place to hang comfortably for a few hours. Service was patient, gracious, and nongratuitous - hitting the fine service balance for us - and after customary respectful attempts at fragmentary French English worked well both ways. Wine list was encyclopedic and surprisingly noninjurious in pricing. Wine service exemplary down to the finest in Zalto and Gabriel glassware. The set menu worked for us. Of course there was the unfortunately necessary for Mich stars hyper- architecture but unlike so many other starred joints each dish had pure concentrated and unconfused aromas and flavors and textures underneath the beautiful architecture. PIC is a hit if you have a grand to spare."

PIC,50,One of the top three meals of my life,"I’m not saying this in any way to be a braggart but just to give you a frame of reference. Since 2012, I’ve been to 40 of the top 50 restaurants on the World Pellegrino list and to almost 80% of the 3 star restaurants in Europe, following closely behind Andy Hayler, but for some reason Pic eluded me until we decided to do a proper Rhone wine tour. This was literally one of the top three meals I’ve had in my life. I can’t tell you how special you feel with the service, the tailored wine pairing and collaboration with the Somm. It was one of the best food and wine pairings I’ve ever had at any Michelin restaurant, Château Jamet Cote Rotie 1999, Beaucastel 1998 and Janasse 2005 CDP, Le Meal Blanc 2011, Chave 2005 hermitage rouge and 2012 Blanc, 2011, Château Grillet…popopopo. Exquisite!!! Blew my mind. The warm and humorous service, elegance of the decor, Baccarat crystal glasses, chandeliers. To end it all with a 30 year cognac and a Cohiba siglo IV in the patio. I can die right now a happy man. Apex of earthly pleasure."

PIC,50,A Sublime Experience,"Dining at the highest level. Cuisine, ambience, and service best in class. Food is a true reflection of Chef’s vision of connecting to the land and sea. Service never missed a beat, and the dining room was extremely elegant. We truly appreciated the references to the legacy of the Pic Family."

PIC,40,Lovely,"All around fantastic experience with a few things to be aware of, that would have been helpful to know before.    When they welcome you in for an aperitif prior to dinner, just be aware this is not included. Additionally, water is not included and you’d think at this fine of dining it would be. We would have liked this to be more clear, as we prefer to pay one bulk cost vs having additional fees added on after which ruins the experience a bit.    Otherwise, the food and wine was superb. Quite the 5 hour experience that we feel lucky to have been a part of."

PIC,50,A night to remember,Stunning Restaurant Experience - 10 course Sensory Travel @ 320 Euros. Extremely attentive & knowledgeable staff. Cuisine was an explosion of tastes.  Only fault we had was our table did not have napkins & the waiter was so grateful when we pointed out all the other tables around us where missing too.

PIC,50,A truly beautiful experience is offered by Anne-Sophie Pic at her restaurant in Valence.,"The meal composed of ten plates was original, of exquisite imagination and taste. It was a rare experience that we were very happy to share with our mother for her 91st birthday. The price was comparatively reasonable. Watching the staff lift the lids off platters in unison was like watching a ballet. It was unforgettable."

PIC,50,A delightful hotel and restaurant,"This is an ideal stop on a journey through France. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the pool is very pleasant, breakfast is copious and delicious, but of course the real attraction is the two restaurants, One is three star Michelin, but for those not desiring the hoopla of haute cuisine, the ""petit Pic"", the bistrot called Chez Andre, is very good as well. The only consideration is that the menu is limited and doesn't change so much, so you would have not a great deal of choice for a stay over more than one night. But a very good experience overall, with attentive and friendly staff."

PIC,50,As excellent as last year,We stayed at hotel Pic in the way to Alsace from Valbonne. Every was perfect at the hotel and the restaurants as last year. We took the 10 course menu with wine and do not regret.

PIC,50,I can't speak highly enough of our stay and Anne Sophie's kindness,"This was a birthday trip and it was all we expected and more. Courteous welcome and very spacious suite overlooking the garden area which is an oasis of luxury once you come off the street. Swimming pool was excellent for our son although despite the luxurious beds real shade was hard to find, it was very hot.  To get to the serious bit we had an excellent aperitif and explanation of the menu items , 10 courses. The sommelier as one would expect was VERY knowledgable.  The dining experience was fabulous, lots of flavours and surprises.  Needless to say this is a 3 star Michelin experience and one of my best meals. Being difficult the only problem was that the staff were obliged to wear masks which sometimes left their explanations difficult to hear.  I was treated to a birthday cake , see photo but will leave you to visit to see the exquisite presentation of this menu, I keep the photos for myself.  As icing on the cake we were invited to the kitchen and met Anne Sophie, the organisation is exemplary and despite the number of dishes served everything is well organised and calm.  After dinner Anne Sophie passed to see all was well and I have a photo with her and my son.  We were extremely impressed with everything although the magnificent breakfast was somewhat too copious for me.  A great experience and the kitchen deserves all the praise it can get, Magic !"

PIC,50,5 star Dinner in a fabulous 3 a Michelin Star restaurant,"We booked dinner, bed and breakfast at PiC in Valence to celebrate a big birthday. The location is superb as to be expected. Our dining experience was absolutely superb. The chefs top menu and wine pairings were exquisite. The 5 hour dining experience is pure theatre - a real joy. What a pleasure to have been able to chat twice during the evening with Anne Sophie - a distinguished, courteous and charming lady with all she has achieved. I also wish to mention and commend the wonderful service by Anne Sophie’s tremendous team - especially Batiste and Margot who looked after us so brilliantly.  Breakfast was also a real treat, served to us by Amelle for whom nothing was too much trouble    If you can manage to go to PIC then we wholeheartedly recommend it."

PIC,40,Disappointed,"To be honest, we were disappointed with this Hotel restaurant. When we arrived, I was dying for a cup of tea but in the room there were no tea/coffee making facilities. Had to wait 40min for room service. When we went to the reception room before going to the restaurant we had to get up and ask for someone to take our order for aperitifs after 25 minutes waiting. Once we were in the restaurant, everything was perfect, lovely food & good service.  Having spent well over 1000€ I think that we should have had more attentive service."

PIC,20,Massive disappointment again...,"For many years we refused to return to Sophie Pic’s restaurant simply because it was  a disaster in every sense...!! We paid over 2500 Euros for 4 people with wine included.  For that amount of money one can rightfully expect the top, the best, the immaculate.  The service was bad, the setting is plain and uneventful, the food was average with some hype and the desert was a total deception.  We were recently invited by friends to return to Pic in Valence.  Nothing has changed...a massive disappointment. Pic is in the process of becoming an industry...when that happens the spirit of the Chef disappears into plain banality. A tourist trap ! Very Sad !"

PIC,50,FANTASTIC MEAL,"Great setting, fabulous service and a wonderful meal. A fantastic experience and one of the best restaurants we have been to. Every course was memorable and the staff were first class. A real treat."

PIC,50,Amazing different dining experience,"Myself and wife had the harmony menu. The welcome was very good maybe a little cold. There is quite a bit of spice, floral and Japanese influence in the cooking. It’s different to what we have experienced before and very much makes you think differently about your food. The smells and tastes are different. The quality of the ingredients were excellent and Anne Sophie Pics creativity and skill is immense. The most memorable dishes were the Berlingots which was superb, the crab, lamb, white Mille feuille and the chocolate and tarragon desert was superb. I thought the red mullet dish a little over seasoned and I like salt. We found the petit fours with coffee only ok but these were very minor criticisms. Anne Sophie visited each table and came across very warm and friendly which was nice. The service was excellent. I think I still prefer classic cooking at heart but this is really interesting food and at the cutting edge of creativity. It is a must experience for anyone which loves food."

PIC,50,Wonderful experience,"Just want one would expect from a 3 Michelin Star establishment and then some. Welcoming staff, fascinating and beautifully cooked food. A clear love of citrus enhances the menu. Not for the ordinary..."

PIC,50,A magical day at Pic. You have to go.,"From the moment we entered to the moment we left the whole experience was 1st class, top notch, simply superb. The welcome from the staff was classy and understated. Don't go here if you're looking for value for money. Don't think about price. Just enjoy the food, the surroundings and the service. We opted for The Harmony Menu and it was fantastic. Outstanding quality, fully explained on the menu cards which are presented to you at the end of the experience. We certainly hope to return in the future. Just go."

PIC,50,Birthday lunch,"We booked this special restaurant for my birthday and was not disappointed. The food was amazing, the service was brilliant and the relaxed sophisticated space was perfect. It was a wonderful lunch with so many mixes of flavours and tastes. The food was divine and the staff are just lovely. They even presented a birthday cake which was so sweet. We also were lucky enough to have a quick look at the kitchen. Overall lovely lovely birthday experience."

PIC,50,Exquisitely perfect,"Wonderful from start to finish.    It is the attention to all the details that ensures the flavours are brought out, whether intense or subtle and whether complementary or contrasting.    Decor and ambience are calming.    Service was attentive. But it would be helpful if explanations were delivered more clearly and audibly."

PIC,50,Excellent! A turbot you will never forget!,"We were 6 of us travelling from London to Valence for a gastronomic week-end, we ate at the 3 stars Michelin restaurant of PIC and we were all seduced by the menu, wine and service we received.    We all took the Harmony Menu (280 euros) and we had in total 7 dishes + amuse bouches (after / before) but I have to say the coastal turbot cooked meunière style with Granny smith apple broth and chartreuse, tagette and shiso was something I will never forget. Just perfect!    The restaurant is very nice and welcoming, service is top notch as you would expect!"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,The best!,"Extraordinary meal! Ordered the tasting menu, and every bite was sumptuous. The staff exceeded our expectations. The whole experience was absolutely amazing!"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Excellent,"Fantastic food and service under the excellent supervision of Mr Giuseppe Giliberti, that makes every guest feel special. Highly recommended"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,"Impressive service, stellar cuisine, and an amazing wine collection","Dining in this classically furnished room is a unique experience given the complex quality of the cuisine and the highly impressive service. After an aperitif in a large sitting room adjacent to the main dining room, we were led to a table near the window looking out at the Rhine. The service was impressive with my napkin changed twice during the course of the meal among other special touches. The tasting menu was complex with each bite a stunning combination of delicate flavors and textures. After a few amuse bouche starters, the main menu involved a series of amazingly tasty dishes highlighting seasonal vegetables, fresh seafood, and a delicious pigeon entree. This was followed by a fantastic cheese platter with many great cheese options from Switzerland, France, and Italy, and then a series of light uniquely presented and flavorful desserts. The wine list is a tome with many relatively reasonable options as well as verticals of great Bordeaux (including of course Coeval blanc!) and Burgundy. All in all, a highly memorable meal. Kudos to the chef and his staff!"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Wow!!!!!!,This is what good looks like! Incredible level of detail from when you arrive to when you leave. The menu was comprehensive and the food quality and presentation were on a different level. Will be back!!

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Best Culinary,It was the best culinary experience we have ever had. It deserves 10 Michelin stars. Highly recommended. Chif is a real star!

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,A small miracle,"The Michelin guide states that three stars means “worth a journey“. This is probably the best restaurant I know, and is the main reason we travel from London to Basel for a short city break. Every item on the menu and between courses is a delight. Staff are courteous, charming and efficient. The sommelier is highly knowledgeable and helpful and chooses wonderful glasses of wine for each course or set of courses. The setting is beautiful. This restaurant has no faults and makes no compromises and the product is close to perfection."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,40,Great dinner but too long…,"Our first visit post-pandemic. We opted for a customized tasting menu and food was exceptional. However, we felt the entire experience wasn’t as good as the previous one. The service was extremely painfully slow and one of the servers kept mixing up our preferences (for example, sparkling vs still water). Our reservation was at 7:30pm but dessert wasn’t served until 11:30pm and we couldn’t leave until 25 minutes past midnight. It was an unnecessarily long 5 hours dinner. We were so tired felt almost like work towards the end of an expensive meal."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,A wonderful evening!,"Having made dinner reservations well in advance with the ever so friendly and helpful Ursula, we started our evening with a cocktail in the beautiful and historic bar to commence the evening (thankfully Ursula suggested a reservation for this segment as as well.) Our server Marcus was friendly, welcoming, and thoughtful. Not only recommending their gin & tonic made with their special house brand of gin, but he kindly he gave us the opportunity to purchase a bottle since it's not sold outside the hotel.    Ursula introduced herself in person (having only spoken on the phone previously) and led us to our reserved dining table. She was a delight to chat with - a true professional!    The four of us each had the Autumn Menu des Rois:    Amuse bouche: small and tasty, a nice start to our dinner. (9/10)  Tuna Toro, Miso, Cucumber: a wonderful combination - delicious. (9.5/10)  Egg Yolk Ravioli: with a perfect amount of truffle. (9.5/10)  Red mullet, Garlic, Saffron: the skin had a perfect crispness, and the fish was cooked perfectly. (10/10)  Venison with Rouennaiser Sauce: the sauce was intense - very flavorful. My venison was slightly over-cooked and a bit tough, but my companions all said theirs was fine. (For my rating, I'll pretend mine was the same). (9.5/10)  Various cheeses: a fairly good assortment, and fresh. (8.5/10)  Praline Parfait: a great presentation of a wonderfully combined dessert that was not too sweet and perfectly delicious. (10/10)    Service was fairly friendly and smooth. The decor is old-world charm.    I rate a restaurant solely on it's food, and for Cheval Blanc I'd give it a firm 9.5/10. There's only one three-Michelin star I've been to that I consider better. That's a fine showing for Mr. Peter Knogl (he kindly introduced himself to the patrons at each table near the end of the meal) and I highly recommend his restaurant. I'll be back - it's well worth attending!"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Amazing culinary journey,"Again, we enjoyed a most wonderful evening at the Cheval Blanc. Presentation and attention to detail was impeccable. Staff (especially Giuseppe) were very personable and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal. We can say with great enthusiasm that Chef ""extraordinaire"" Peter Knogl has once again ""outdid himself"". It was a most fantastic presentation of amazing courses. The flavors are beyond the best words. We visit ""starred"" restaurants around the world and we can honestly say the Cheval Blanc is our most favorite. Our highest compliments to Chef Knogl and team !"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,A new level,"A faultless and beautiful restaurant. Staff are wonderful, food quality and inventiveness are beyond comprehension, the sommelier is helpful and highly knowledgeable, and the setting is comforting and attractive. The 3 star chef is actually in the kitchen, unlike so many equivalent restaurants, and takes the time to talk to all customers. Unequivocally a 3 Michelin star experience. Go if you have some spare cash and perhaps even if you don’t."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,cuisine to remember,"Cheval Blanc has held 3 stars since 2015 or so, and after our dinner there recently, we say more than deservedly so. You can opt for two menus of either 5 or 7 courses but there is also a fairly broad à la carte choice. We were very happy with our menu, the langoustine starter (the langoustine being from South Africa), the sole 'petit bateau' with truffle fish dish and the pigeon main excellent and standing out. Refer to Mr. Hayler's review for more details. Next time we will go for the à la carte choices, such as a very tempting lobster starter and wagyu meat main, not available in the menu. The wine list is , as might be expected for a 3*** place, vast, with many choices of quite rare Swiss wines but also a large choice of Burgundy and Bordeaux wines. The DRC Corton I had spotted on the wine list before travelling was alas gone, so we opted for a bottle of 2011 Bonnes Mares from Dujac - this needed decanting but drank beautifully after roughly 45 minutes. A most enjoyable bottle. I indulged in a 50 yr old Armagnac as digestif - excellent if somewhat overpriced.  Service was relaxed and efficient but the sequence of dishes arrived at a slow pace - perhaps this was because there was a wedding party requiring special attention... I'll be more than happy to return"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Vini vidi vici : Top Cook,Top of the top ! This is an experience to do and to remember….this cook is near to perfection!  All from the beginning to the end is an art piece of taste and palate ….tasty cooking knowledge - this cook knows his job !  I can only can recommend this place which is a temple for epicurean fans .  The restaurant needs a Renovation- old fashioned interior not very attractive to younger generation to which I do no longer belong …. But atmosphere makes an important detail for me to a nice evening

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,30,Uninspired vegetarian menu,"This place is wonderful if you're not vegetarian. The atmosphere and service is excellent, however this is not the place to go if you're a vegetarian. A couple of the courses tasted pretty much the same ... veggies with a curry spice or sauce, and overall I thought the vegetarian menu was lazy and uninspired. I was surprised to find at the end of the evening that the veggie menu cost was the same as the regular menu which included lobster, wagu beef and seafood."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,A very special celebration,"We are fairly frequent visitors to Basel in order to visit our daughter, who has lived and worked in this lovely city for about 6 years. After a long delay due to COVID, we have returned this week to celebrate her 30th birthday. We always stay at the Les Troia Rois, which is always top flight, and is again. We also always have at least one dinner meal each visit at Cheval Blanc and the magic of Peter Knogl. We had a magnificent dinner for four last night, topped by the saddle of venison (mousse line of celery and sauce rouennaise), sea bass with chorizo and cucumber, and lagoustine and in a light curry and green apple sauce with paired wines. It was a fabulous celebration of our daughter’s birthday and Peter Knogl’s “greatest joy [in] pampering our guests with a cuisine full of color, shape and sunshine.” Such an incredible four hour extravaganza is not cheap, but one doesn’t often find restaurants with 3 Michelin stars and 19 GaultMillau points that are not worth the cost. Cheval Blanc is a relatively small restaurant but gorgeous in decor and a priceless Rhine River view. The service is spectacular, good humored, but serious in its quest for excellence and guest comfort and information. A special ending is a humidor of choice, and immensely fine Swiss chocolates."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,"Stunning location, stunning food.",Fantastic visit to an amazing restaurant. The food was exquisite as was the wine. Not the cheapest place in Basel to eat but well worth the visit.

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Simply one of the best,"As always to dine here is a very rewarding experience. Apart from the fact that the menu is reasonably wide and the cooking fully meets what you expect from a 3 star restaurant I find it particularly remarkable that really every detail is taken proper care of: bread, amuse geule, cheese, petit patisserie is of the highest standard too (these Details can in otherwise excellent restaurants sometimes be disappointing). The surroundings are splendid, the service extremely kind and efficient. Surely I place to return regularly."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Pricey but delicious,Pricey very top quality food. For a fancy lunch with a special person this is just the place to make a top imporession

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Food of the highest standards,"I have not been to the Cheval blanc for quite some time. My recent visit convinced me that I must come more often. I know very many of the Michelin 2 or 3 star restaurants in France, Italy, Japan and Germany. This definitely is among the very best. And that says it all. Every detail of the meal from the nibbles at the start to the petit four with the coffee is just perfect. The ambience is splendid and the service not only attentive I find it pleasantly informal, relaxed and warm. A splendid place, I can only warmly recommend. You will surely be more than satisfied."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,"Simply outstanding, delicious,","Simply outstanding, delicious, incredible, superb food. A real treat. Exceptional good. We will come back for sure."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,The perfect dining experience,"This was as close as I have to come to a perfect meal. Simply sensational food, great location, outstanding service."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Very Good,Excellent experience! Will go back soon. Great food. Great atmosphere. I am glad to have been there.

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,10 stars,It was amazing experience to enjoy delicious food and wine. Service was outstanding. Only all the best for them if its here and option 10 stars they deserve it.

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Exceptional dinner,"What an experience to seat in the beautiful restaurant facing the Rhein enjoying an unforgettable dinner and service. The five course dinner has more small courses and we took the accompanying wine with each course. Definitively, to repeat for a special event!"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,An Unforgettable Dinner,"We booked a reservation online weeks before arriving in Basel. This restaurant is located in the Grand Hotel Les Trois Rois. The dining room is nicely decorated. Also, an awesome view of the Rhine River. We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The restaurant offers a 5 course and 6 course chef's menu as well as ala carte. We opted for the 6 course. Absolutley fantastic! Each course was artfully presented. I don't think I can pick the right words to describe the dishes. They were all amazing! Service was pleasant, attentive and not overdone- made it a relaxed enjoyable dinner. Staff explained every dish clearly. Also took time to describe the selection of cheeses. The dinner will take at least 3 hours. Timing between courses was just right. We did not feel rushed or felt we had to wait too long for the next course. The chef came out and visited each table towards the end of dinner. A nice touch. There are only 10 tables inside the restaurant. It was fully booked on the Friday we were there. We will definitely dine here again next time we are in Basel."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Breakfast,"We had a complimentary breakfast with our stay. This location of the hotel used to be a grand ballroom, and it was a perfect for an early morning breakfast. The buffet had a wide variety of options for everyone."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Simply amazing,"What can I say. We had an amazing lunch, choosing the 6 course menu, every single course was cooked to perfection. The flavors were so vibrant, the textures subtle and wonderful    Service of course was outstanding and impeccable    I have to admit, I ate 5 bread rolls, they were absolutely stunning, and had 2 slices of bread with the cheese....glad I ate all of the bread as the portions are rather on the small side and as I am not the smallest, I think I would still be a little hungry after the meal....    Even so, it was worth every cent and I can only recommend going there"

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Want to thank my friend Maryanne.,"While traveling with two other couples who enjoy fine dining and a good wine experience we each picked a restaurant that we thought would be a great experience. Maryanne won the fine dining pick with Ceval Blank by Peter Knogl. A close second was Yamazato in Amsterdam. We asked the Sommelier to pick local wines to pair with dinner. Each pick was excellent. I had to take my camera out to picture the labels. I hope to try to purchase several when we come back to Chicago.    The food and service was excellent in every way. Anyone who has a opportunity to dine here should not pass up the opportunity. The price for the quality of food, wine, and service was a value."

Cheval Blanc By Peter Knogl,50,Was there on invitation,Enjoyed a selection of specialities to be tasted of excellent quality. The locality is wonderfully situated on the river Rhine.

Pierre Gagnaire,50,A nice place in Paris,"Nice interior design, pleasant and attentive service - we liked the graphics on the walls! Well thought out champagne selection. Honest, pure, and bright flavours dominated the plates instead of tiresome molecular gastronomy. The sauces seemed to be partly over reduced and therefore too salty....More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Very good place,"Fine French gastronomy. The chef has created an original menu full of flavors. I've never eaten so well, everything was perfect!"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Perfection,"We had an incredible experience. The service, food, wine were perfect. And they were very flexible offering us vegeterian options, which were all incredible. Not a cheap lunch but I definitely recommend it!"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Divine,"A beautiful place recently renovated, where art, generosity, finess, attention to details, are a religion. An amazing experience in our short overall horrible stay in dirty and dangerous Paris."

Pierre Gagnaire,40,A culinary experience with top service,"Nice ambience, very attentive service, imaginative cuisine with many surprise dishes accompanying the starters and mains ."

Pierre Gagnaire,50,23 years engagement lunch Anniversary,To Hervè and his most excellent waiting staff. To Philippe the chef for is incredible cooking.

Pierre Gagnaire,50,A fantastic end to a lovely autumn weekend in Paris,Fantastic food. Some many flavours. Staff are of course knowledgeable of the food and very personable. Pierre chatted to the customers and helped serve some of the dishes. We’ll be back as it seems a ritual now after running a marathon!

Pierre Gagnaire,30,underwhelming food and service,"In short, Pierre Gagnaire does not meet the expectation of a 3-star Michelin restaurant if I have to benchmark it with its peers in terms of the food and the service. I have been dining in Michelin restaurants around the world, and I'm trained and...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,"Everything is great, except me as a women to get a menu without prices, seriously it's 2021","So yes, it's worth 3 Michelin stars and the food and the service both were excellent, so many tastes and flavors, creative dishes and beautiful presentation, one thing just drives me crazy, that they still give to a women a menu without prices, seriously it's...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,10,Terrible service and Mediocre food,"Came with my family expecting wonderful food and good service. Both were not to be true. The 3 of us ordered 3 tasting menus and one plate of Truffle Noire Foie Gras to share as suggested by the server. The food was okay, nothing special....More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,"Great food, service, atmosphere but not particularly creative dishes","Overall, an amazing experience. The food was top quality, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was sophisticated. The dishes were all very classic, which is fantastic, but it means that there is no creativity in the food. A great one-off experience but I would...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Worth Michelin 3 stars!,"The restaurant is conveniently located near Champs Élysée. We were warmly welcomed by the restaurant staff upon our arrival and they nicely took care of our coats. We've ordered lunch sets. The pre-dining dishes were very attractive, delicious and creative. The bread were freshly made,...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,The best 300 Euro lunch experience,"Simply sublime. Exquisite inventive food, extraordinary the service, for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, it is truly worth it.

Pierre Gagnaire,50,A just perfect gourmet experience,"The degustation menu is very good with several details - small things like the way they cut the warm bread in front of you or the butter to all the complexity of all small bites and flavors.

Pierre Gagnaire,10,"Complicated menu card, too","Complicated menu card, too much food ( #foodwaste), a lot of staff but no one noticed the empty glasses, not a service cozy atmosphere"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Day after marathon,Had a lovely meal here. Food was gorgeous and we were the last out of the restaurant in the afternoon. Will go back next time in Paris

Pierre Gagnaire,40,What is the best French cuisine?,"We selected Pierre Gagnaire for a family celebration dinner after long reviews of 2 and 3 Michelin stars restaurants in Paris. We wanted to go to “the place”, held by one of the most respected French chef. We were four and took the tasting menu,...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,10,Worst 3 Michelin star restaurant,"The appetiser tasted very weird, lots of portion but nothing stands out. Waited for 90 mins before the entree come, could not believe this happens in a 3 Michelin star restaurant"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Worth every star,"Suffice it to say that we ordered a la carte and liked it so much that we came back two days later and had the extensive tasting menu. If you have a limited number of three star places in Paris that you can visit, this...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Simply perfect,"Atmosphere understatedly sophisticated, extraordinary service and perfectly calibrated between charming and efficient - strikingly good in every sense. And the food...stunningly good - modern but not over the top. Only thing to remember is call your bank manager before going ;)"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,Amazing service with amazing food!,"We came here for a surprise birthday dinner for my newly fiancé, the staff were amazing. The level of service was spectacular! They were patient, understanding and ever so helpful and the food was delicious. We had the lunch set menu and it was fabulous!...More"

Pierre Gagnaire,50,OTT,This is for serious foodisy I am not a fan of 8 to 12 courses so I cannot judge it fairly if you are in Paris it is one of ten 3 star restaurant so you should give it a try.

Pierre Gagnaire,50,"Brilliant food, friendly staff, mind blowing experience",Pierre Gagniere offered us one of the best food we’ve eaten with plenty of vegetarian options. The experience altogether stands out with a lot of variety being offered at the highest quality and taste. Good ambience and well informed staff and waiters.

Flocons de Sel,50,Just the best,Merci chef ainsi qu’à son épouse Amazing lunch for our 5 years anniversary The food was incredible will be back thanks again

Flocons de Sel,50,3rd visit,after some years we hade the pleasure to return to this wonderful place. excellent service combined with the great works of the kitchen and the chefs great talent make this restaurant a must-go. thank you for the memorable moment and the friendly talks.

Flocons de Sel,50,Creative cuisine in Alpine ambiance,"The food was delicious and creative, the service was excellent and personal by the chef and his wife. Nice Alpine ambiance."

Flocons de Sel,50,"Stunning, perfect evening","One of the best meals of my 41 years. The service was friendly yet respectful, and every dish honored and elevated the freshest local ingredients. Wine pairings could have been a touch more on point, but everything else was truly magnificent. Can't wait to return."

Flocons de Sel,50,Magnificent!,"I traveled to Megeve especially to visit Emanuel Renaut’s restaurant. There is nothing pretentious here - first Mr. Renaut greeted his guests out on the balcony overlooking the mountains that inspire his cooking. Later inside, he surprised us with subtle flavors containing mountain elements - herbs in particular. Even the salad course, with geranium oil made me smile. My favorite herb was the ‘crysilus’ ? (Wood sorrel leaves I think) - a citrusy tang that lit up my venison and strawberry dessert. And then there was the Porcini he’d found that morning while hiking. I could smell the mountain on my plate!"

Flocons de Sel,50,Never disappoints!!!,"We try to visit this gem at least twice a year. This summer the quality was,as always, at the very top! We both had a cocktail before dinner on the patio close to the veggie garden. Wonderful!!! As always, we both had the menu where the food and presentation of each course was simply amazing. My only complaint was the service between courses was a bit slow. In a restaurant of this quality, one does not expect a quick meal but four and a half hours was a bit much.  Will we go back? Absolutely!!!"

Flocons de Sel,50,Sophisticated and chic,A unique gastronomic experience. The setting is sophisticated and chic with an astonishing simplicity. The dishes are beautiful looking mostly excellent but some are on the heavy side w eggs. The chef was quite attentive to replace those with exquisite alternatives. All in all a great dining experience

Flocons de Sel,50,A miracle !,"Although I know the artistry of Emmanuel Renaud since almost 20 years, I was somehow hesitant to visit his new dome. I was wrong.  The establishment is absolutely balanced, respectful, true gourmet and warm. Apart from amazing food, all the rest was impeccable, mainly the service. My only hint would be that the cheese platter was not at the height of the rest: ça merite un peu plus de finesse et originalité. Still, we are very much pleased and will be back very soon !  PS : Congrats to his wife as well !"

Flocons de Sel,50,"If not perfect, very close!","Incredible evening at the Flocon de Sel, where the whole evening was just great. The chef will surprise you both by the simplicity of some plates, that will suddenly make you realise how incredible some simple products can be as well as the complexity of some associations, that were always super balanced and original.  The use of local herbs & flowers, from the garden or from the mountain adds a palette of interresting tastes to discover or rediscover.  Local wines associated were beautifull & well chosen.  Worh mentionning, the chef's collection of Chartreuse is the most impressive one I've seen :)"

Flocons de Sel,50,the summer version is even more brilliant,"having stayed and dined in March in deep snow it was fascinating to return to 32 heat , the vegetable garden in full bloom and a summer menu full of flowers and herbs    the cooking is simply incredible -makes everywhere else feel a bit basic -but the finishing touch is the quality of the team and the service they provide    it really deserves the three michelin stars and congrats to Emmanuel and Kristine for creating such a magical place"

Flocons de Sel,50,A Well Choreographed Experience,"In our daily lives, fast food plays a very large part and over time it becomes normalised. This restaurant is the antithesis, with service being a theatrical event complementing the high quality of the food and wine on offer. Price does not enter into the equation, as the experience remains a very fond memory. All 6 of us had the tasting menu, and no doubt will continue the discussion for days to come."

Flocons de Sel,50,Merci!,"What can I say? Just a stunning experience and a wonderful meal from a great and friendly chef. The location is wonderful. The food is amazing. The service is top notch. Make sure to stay at the hotel if you dine there. Yes, it is expensive but quality has a price and the chef doesn’t cut any corner. Highly recommended. Merci Emmanuel"

Flocons de Sel,50,top of the hill,"The second time in the place , but different season : extraordinary experience , warm and fantastic welcome and service , and what can I say about the food and the cook himself .... I miss vocabulary !"

Flocons de Sel,40,"Great, but at what cost?","This was a great experience, but for me, it was absolutely not worth the 270 euro per person fixed price + 110 euro per person wine pairing. 800 euro for a meal for two people should be the best meal I've ever had in my life (because it was definitely the most expensive), and it wasn't the best. But in all fairness to the restaurant, this is not my preferred style of food. So this review is best read by people like me who don't care about fine gastronomic French dining. If you love this type of food, then maybe the price will be worth it to you. Certainly every dish was perfectly executed, the service was friendly and perfect, and I really liked the dining atmosphere. It felt important yet not pretentious.    I especially liked the wine pairing with all local regional wines. Absolutely perfect for the dishes and each wine was different and interesting. None were expensive wines, so again, I thought the price was too high, but I appreciate the effort of the sommelier to find great regional wines paired for the meal.    One other comment to note: there were a lot of flies in the restaurant bothering us during the meal and covering the cheese cart. It was unpleasant to watch the server cutting cheese that had dozens of flies on it and then serving it to us, especially in this formal and expensive environment.    In summary, if you are reading this and wondering if you should invest in a meal here, I would say yes but only if you know that you love gourmet French dining. If not, save your money."

Flocons de Sel,50,Romantic & gastronomic WE offered as a surprise by my wife.,"Amazing place, very friendly personnel always there to help without being overly present.    We had a small bungalow with a great view from the bed.    We took the gastronomic surprise 9 plates. It was a fantastic journey, every plate was well prepared, several were a real surprise with a lot of taste but we kept the appetite until the end.    The sommelier was also very sympathic as he found my wife’s favorite wine in his cellar even if it was on the « carte des vins »."

Flocons de Sel,50,Amazing experience,"What a fantastic experience.  I was lucky enough to be invited Friday evening to eat in the kitchen. So many courses and each one so different. So much attention to detail. The staff are all very attentive, each course was explained in French as well as English.  Can't recommend highly enough."

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,10,Worst experience ever. Completely atrocious….,"Atrocious restaurant. We made a reservation 2 months in advance and on the day of our dinner, they called and cancelled our reservation because they overbooked. No apology, no attempt to reschedule, just a curt message and hung up! Completely shocked!"

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,40,Idyllic dinner,"Magnificent terrace in summer, calm as if you were on a peaceful islet is an elegant historical setting surrounded by the verdant trees of Bois de Boulogne... the dishes are sophisticated, tediously elaborated with finesse and perfectly complementing flavours... A really good fine dining experience"

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,An excellent venue under superb management,"We went last evening for a ore-Valentine""s Day dinner. Everyone wad first class ftom the welcome to the decor, the food and eines to the table service. A five star experience which we wholeheartedly recommend."

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,Posh restaurant !!,"This restaurant is a t the edge of the ""Bois de Boulogne"". It has excellent food and is a remnant from an elegant past. Lovely stop after a good walk in the woods."

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,太喜歡這裡，上等的服務，謝謝waiter John,同朋友一起來這家餐廳吃飯，價格很實惠，又有上等的環境和服務。最開心的是遇到了這裡的服務生John，幽默風趣，知道我的生日後，還給我製造了好幾個驚喜，和朋友們開心極了，太難忘了。Thanks John. It is so nice of you. We are so lucky that we can meet! Thanks for your humour and perfect service. Thanks a lot!!

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,Excellent,"An excellent restaurant étiolé in the heart of le bois de Bologne. Service is impeccable. We had fois gras, ravioli with lobsters and amazing macaroni. As a main course we had veal, and lobsters with knoqui macaroni. we had an excellent wine. Highly recommended."

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,40,Fun & Elegant Art Nouveau setting with a wonderful welcoming staff,We had a lovely champagne lunch outside on the terrace. We opted for the vegetarian menu (there was only 1 vegetarian option). Although it was HOT our experience was very good overall. There were annoying bees attracted by our food not terrible but annoying. 40%...More

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,Delicious dinner in a nice setting,This is one of the many iconic restaurants you can find in Paris.This one is located in Le Bois de Boulogne. The menu was delicious and the staff was very attentive and welcoming. We will come back to get another delightful gourmet experience

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,Great,"Really a great place, with a lot of charm. Food was excellent (Turbot, Macaroni are must have), and in appropriate quantities. Nice services, and excellent wine advice."

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,40,Fine,Very friendly people. Very beautiful restaurant. But very expensive for small dishes. After our visit we were still hungry.

Le Pavillon de la Grande Cascade,50,Worth a visit !!,The food is delicious and very reasonably priced for a one star restaurant in Paris! The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is excellent! We loved it and are definitely returning soon!

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Good food and nice service,"The food there was great, we went there for the weekend brunch, the food surely worth the price and the staff was nice. we would surely revisit the place"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Gourmet Dutch cuisine worthy of Michelins star,We visited on a cool August night and were not sure what to expect. From the word go the staff was warm and courteous. Not stuffy at all like some other Michelins restaurants. Amazing food - both feasts for the eyes and the palate. My husband had the wine pairing and said it was sublime. We have dined at some Michelin star restaurants before and this is a stand out. Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A wonderful culinary experience!,"We had a wonderful dinner at this amazing restaurant with seven courses - each of the PERFECT and delicious. The staff was welcoming and the historic setting feels like you have stepped back into the best part of the 17th century. Each course had terrific combinations of flavors served on special plates for each course. The dessert was on a ceramic pillow - how perfect!    A lovely family runs this special place and the chef, Yves van der Hoff deserves to be recgnized by Michelin. Every member of the staff made feel diners comfortable and were warm and friendly.    We highly recommend this restaurant. It is a very special experience and worth the money."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A must for foodies,"Probably the most beautiful presentations for all the courses that I have ever seen. Not only that, but it all tasted delicious. Fun history about the house and the only thing I would recommend would be to ask to be seated upstairs as the downstairs room is tiny hence you see constant in and out of the kitchen going on."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Dining Experience,"Exceptional dining experience. The food, wine and service were phenomenal. The home is also beautiful. Would highly recommend dinner here."

de Silveren Spiegel,40,Beautiful environment,"Beautiful place , modern furnish , although raining day there was plenty of light .I enjoyed windows near the green yard"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Unforgettable tasting menus with superb service,This dinner experience was the highlight of our Amsterdam trip . The 8 course tasting menu paired with wine tasting was beautiful to look at and full of wonderful flavors. The service was impeccable . A wonderful dinner.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Perfect and stunning,"What an experience !  This is another world. Everything was beyond perfect, original, extremely beautiful. Service was amazing. The place is beautiful in an old Amsterdam house in a quiet street of the city center. I will recommend it to everyone and we will come back. Menu changes every two months, can’t wait !"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Spectacular dining experience.,Another fabulous experience at our favorite restaurant. Creative culinary splendor beautifully presented by friendly wait staff and top notch wine pairing. We look forward to visiting this restaurant on every trip to Amsterdam.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Outstanding,"The food , the people and the ambience were first class! Above Michelin quality!  Outstanding ! Every dish was a masterpiece, the taste unique ! Was an unforgettable night !"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Awesome romantic dining experience,"We visited the restaurant with my wife and. ordered full lunch course. It was worth every penny, incredible experience, delicious dishes and surprisingly good starter and final compliments from the chef. Very friendly and attentive staff. Great atmosphere inside. We were surprised that this restaurant doesn't have a Michelin star, but I think it's not for long :)"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,"Amazing experience, must try!",Amazing experience and food. Every single thing was thought out and the food was mind blowing! I've never seen food prepared like this.    We did the 8 course meal.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Romantic and Incredible Dinner,"My fince and I had an incredible dinner at De Silveren Spiegel! From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were amazed by the service. We felt so welcomed! The food was absolutely incredible and the wine pairings were perfect. In terms of pricing, the 8 course meal felt reasonably priced for the amount and quality of the courses. I highly recommend if you are spending time in Amsterdam!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,One of the best restaurants in Amsterdam,"The Set Menu prepared by the Chef was wonderful, as always ! We were very well received by the owners, Jim and Francisca. Once a year I have the chance to visit Amsterdam for a trade show, and I never miss De Silveren Spiegel experience."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A Culinary Gem in Amsterdam,"We've dined at multiple Michelin-starred establishments around the world, and while De Silveren Spiegel may not have the stars to its name, the experience here easily rivals, if not surpasses, many of those places. Each dish, meticulously crafted, was a symphony of flavors, with every bite revealing layers and depths that left us in awe. The balance of traditional Dutch ingredients with contemporary techniques was nothing short of genius."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Not to be missed in Amsterdam,"Just another boring five star review. Not much to say when they do everything right. Impeccable food and service. The most interesting thing was the history of the building. Nazis dining downstairs while Jews were hiding upstairs(think Anne Frank). There is a staircase leading to the ceiling (obviously was not there in WWII) that I do not think would have been explained had I not asked. Once I asked, they brought out o book on the building. My suggestion is to fast all day and get the 8 course tasting menu. A little hard to find, down an alley;but worth it"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A Must Try and the staff were amazing!,"This place was so amazing. The building was an original amsterdam home (steep stairs to the bathroom),cozy. I cannot elaborate enough how amazing the food was and the staff. It is Michelin worthy and you get to choose between a 5-8 course meal. We chose a 5 course meal and every dish that came out was so tasty and completely unique. The wine was so good and the cappacino at the end of the meal was the best. Highly recommend you try this place for a new experience with taste buds satisfied."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Most memorable meal!,"This was our most memorable meal in Amsterdam! The food was superb and most creative. I’ve never seen more beautiful courses in my life. The staff was friendly, kind, attentive, and helpful. This is a gem of a restaurant!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A wonderful dining experience,"Worthy of the glowing reviews, de Siveren Spiege combines locally sourced produce with the finest preparation and presentation all in beautiful setting. The taster menu is perfectly balanced and the staff introduce each course with passion and knowledge. The experience was relaxed and unhurried. You will find many less expensive dining options in Amsterdam but you will do very well indeed to find any that are better."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Simply Divine,Truly a top 10 dining experience perhaps top 5. The chef’s sauces are sublime. Presentation is an artform. Relaxed on point service in a historic atmosphere. Worth every penny for the experience. Recommend 7-8 courses.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Wonderful Experience,"I normally don't write reviews, but De Silveren Spiegel compels me to make an exception, and I am finally getting around to it. The restaurant is in a historical building with an old world atmosphere that is fun and relaxing. We had the 8 course dinner with wine pairing. Each course was memorable, being both delicious and wonderfully presented. The wine pairings were splendid. The staff was outstanding, and the service and pacing of the meal were excellent. My wife and I have dined in fine restaurants all over the world, and we both agreed that this experience was one of the best we have ever had. Highly recommended."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Highly recommend,"We had an amazing dining experience. The ambiance, food, and service were all top-notch. I highly recommend it! A must-visit spot for foodies!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,History in the making......,"This restaurant is in an old, historical building with a formal but relaxed atmosphere ...... its charming.  The staff are super friendly & attentive, who take pride in what they do & we especially liked hearing their stories about this fabulous place.  We chose the Lunch Special, which did not disappoint ........ a unique champagne cocktail to begin, four exquisite, exciting courses full of wondrous delights. The attention to detail & artistic flair was impressive.  Delicious wines included to compliment each course, finished with coffee & extra treats [yum]  Highly recommended & we cant wait to revisit!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A special evening is in store for you.,"De Silveren Spiegel is a wonderful restaurant with top-notch service. It is located in a historic building which adds to its splendor. We were greeted with great warmth and excitement. We enjoyed the 5-course meal with wine. That was plenty for us and each dish was noteworthy. The food is Dutch with Germanic touches. The various ingredients appear to be seasonal and thus, locally sourced. The evening was a memorable one and I highly recommend De Silveren Spiegel as a special dinner if you're in town."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Special,de Silveren Spiegel is must experience. Staff are super friendly. I went there summer of 23 and the waiter remembered me as soon as I showed up this time. Every dish of the 8 courses I had just melt in your month. Wine pairing are spot on. Highly recommend this spot if your in Ameterdam.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Magical & delicious,"It was a more than memorable evening, with delicious creations. The chef a 29 year old young man who creates taste explosions and is an artist dressing the plates.  The rest of the staff is really friendly, well informed and they feel what each table needs and wants. The atmosphere is magical and it feels like you having dinner in the golden ages.  I am already look forward to our next visit. When in Amsterdam and you want a special & delicious and magical evening De Silveren Spiegel is the place to be."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Very nice food and classy restaurant,Very very nice restaurant! 8 course menu with paring wine. Location is an old Amsterdam house with a lot of details. Food was Michelin star worthy. We will come back

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A wonderful dining experience,The venue the hospitality and the food in both presentation and taste were exceptional . Our waiter was not only knowledgeable and helpful in making our selections he provided us with a detailed history of this beautiful 400 yrs old house

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A great dining experience not to be missed!,Fine dining at its best! Impeccable service and delicious food with amazing presentation. Went for a romantic birthday dinner and they did not disappoint.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A great place with wonderful staff,A great place with wonderful staff. The sophistication of the food was extremely high. A really impressive experience including the service and charm of the venue. The dishes were really inspired.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Best meal of our trip,"It was a great dinner throughout! Food, service and ambiance were all exceptional. The old building is leaning a little but don't worry it just adds to the experience. The interior is charming in an old world Dutch kind of way. You will not regret booking here!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Absolutely faultless in every way!,"Another amazing meal! Absolutely faultless in every way. The service, ambience, and of course food and drink, were exceptional! This is our fifth visit and we have always been delighted by the experience. Why hasn't this restaurant been given a Michelin star?"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Perfect Meal Variety and Quality,Found this highly rated restaurant through a google search. Wasn’t sure what to expect but wife and I went with the 7 course pre fix menu and wine pairing.  Each dish was inventive and exquisite in its presentation. Flavors and textures were intertwined and left your pallet curious and sometimes even confused in satisfaction.    It would be hard to imagine a better meal in Amsterdam then what we experienced here.  The ambience and service also exceeded expectations.  Definitely recommended if you are looking for a high quality meal that is something you’ve never had before

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Old and New,This resturant is definitely a hidden gem in the city. It is full of surprise. The building itself is full of history.    I had 8 course with wine pairing. I was amazed by the art in plating and the pairing of wine. The staffs there are very nice and helpful. I enjoyed my dinner here and chatted with the customers next table. What a wonderful night! I will definitely recommend it to my friend.

de Silveren Spiegel,50,No better experience in Amsterdam!,"The building, itself, is fantastic and has an amazing history. But the star is the food, with a wonderful presentation and delicious dishes. The staff was also very attentive and were able to accommodate our gluten allergy without skipping a beat (letting them know in advance on the online reservation app makes it easier for them to plan). Pricey if you compare it to the average Dutch meal, but very reasonable for a restaurant of this quality and Michelin rating."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Delightful degustation,"One of my most pleasurable dining experiences in a long time.  We really enjoyed the 7 course degustation. The delicious combination of flavours in each course was amazing.  The atmosphere was terrific, a family run business in a historic building.  This restaurant is an absolute must for lovers of great food."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,A gorgeous setting for a wonderful meal,"I went to De Silveren last night with my wife, my brother and his wife, where we enjoyed a sensational 8 course meal. The old house in which the restaurant resides is gorgeous, with wonderful paintings. The place settings are exquisite, the service is excellent, and the food delicious. I would highly recommend. It is, of course, very expensive. However, for an experience of this type it is not excessive."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Some of the prettiest food pics from our vacation!,"Delicious, artful, and delightful.  Very glad we booked the full pairing--believe it was called the Gold and Silver reservation."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Must visit restaurant in Amsterdam,The ingredients were very fresh. The food taste good with very nice setting. The waiters and waitresses even they are busy but still explained even dish clearly with patience .

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Great evening,Gosh this restaurant and staff were excellent …….Harry Potter and staff looked after us soon as we walked thru the door and it was wonderful to meet Yves the chef….l

de Silveren Spiegel,50,"Perfect flavor, presentation, and pairing from an engaging staff in a one of a kind historical building.","What a wonderful experience, went with my 16yr old daughter. Staff was engaging and made it a very memorable moment as part of our one day in Amsterdam. The flavors, presentation, and pairing was all incredible as well. Highly recommend it!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Fantastic food from a superb chef and his team,"Visited this superb restaurant on Saturday 24th. Stunning food, from an obviously highly talented chef. Cannot fault the experience. Everything from the crockery, to the bread, and the incredible amuse bouche. We opted for the 8 courses. Every single dish was amazing and memorable. Thank you to the chef, and the excellent staff who took care of us    Thoroughly recommended."

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Trendy and delious compositions,We had a wouderfull family dinner in the restaurant de Silveren Spiegel. We had six courses of this very trendy and delicious dishes. The creative compositions were looking like paintings. The taste was realy first class fine dining. The table culture was festive for celebrating the bithday of our mother. We enjoyed the very kind service of Chistoph and the historic atmosphere of the building of the 17th century .

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Our best meal in Amsterdam,"This lovely restaurant is owned and operated by a family and the chef is only 27 years old! The food is amazing, both visually and in content. We have been to one other Michelin rated restaurant, and although this is in the guide, it is not yet rated, but it should be at least 3 stars!!! The service is awesome, and the entire experience was the best in Amsterdam. We're happy we chose it on our last night - what a treat!!!"

de Silveren Spiegel,50,Returned 8 years later and even better,"In 2015 de Silveren Spiegel was my first ""fancy meal"". I had a few tasting menus prior but not at the level here in terms of flavors and presentation. That experience was the first chapter in the book of becoming a full fledged foodie.    When I knew I would be back in Amsterdam this year I couldn't pass on the opportunity to return my last night in the city. To say it didn't disappoint is an understatement. While the staff was just as lovely as I had remembered, the flavor combinations and whimsical plating was on another level. It was easily the best meal I had in a 10 day, 2 country vacation.    I hope to be back again sooner than later."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,An Enchanting Sunday Afternoon at Sir Elly's Terrace: A Journey Through Shanghai's Heart,"Picture this: the sun hanging low in the sky, casting a warm golden glow over the bustling Bund of Shanghai. It was a Sunday afternoon, and the city was alive with the harmonious blend of old-world charm and modern energy. Amidst this vibrant tapestry, I found myself on a journey to Sir Elly's Terrace, a hidden gem perched atop the Peninsula Hotel.    The Bund, a historic waterfront area, has long been a canvas that tells the story of Shanghai's evolution. Its skyline, adorned with a collection of colonial-era architecture and towering skyscrapers, mirrors the city's dynamic soul. And in the heart of this lively mosaic, the Peninsula Hotel stands as a testament to the city's elegance and luxury. The Peninsula's history, entwined with the Kadoorie family's legacy, adds an extra layer of significance to this remarkable place.    As I stepped onto Sir Elly's Terrace, a sense of enchantment enveloped me. It was around 5pm, and the terrace was bathed in a soft, ethereal light. The atmosphere was a symphony of relaxation and sophistication – a perfect escape from the city's hustle and bustle. The Terrace's real magic lay in its panoramic views of the Bund. From this vantage point, I could feel time slowing down, allowing me to soak in the city's rich history and its modern ambitions.    In the company of friends, I decided to embrace the moment with a classic cocktail – a Negroni. The Negroni's harmonious blend of flavors seemed to mirror the essence of the Bund itself – a fusion of old and new, bitter and sweet. Sipping the Negroni, I felt connected to the stories that had unfolded on these historic streets.    The Peninsula Hotel is renowned for its impeccable service, and Sir Elly's Terrace was no exception. The staff's genuine warmth and attentiveness elevated the experience from wonderful to unforgettable. Every detail, from the perfect spot to offering insights about the city, was thoughtfully taken care of. It was as though the Peninsula's commitment to excellence extended beyond the walls of the hotel and onto the terrace.    As the sun began its descent, I realized that my visit to Sir Elly's Terrace was more than a mere outing – it was a journey through Shanghai's heart. The Bund's timeless allure, the Kadoorie family's enduring legacy, and the Peninsula's dedication to creating moments of wonder all intertwined to craft an experience that I would forever cherish.    As I reluctantly left the terrace, I couldn't help but marvel at how the city's vibrant energy continued to pulse. The Bund, with its history etched in its stones, stood as a testament to Shanghai's journey through time. And in the midst of it all, Sir Elly's Terrace remained a hidden oasis, a radiant jewel that had offered me an experience of pure enchantment. As I walked away, I knew that this was more than a visit – it was a story I would tell for years to come, a memory that had become a part of my own journey."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Nice drinks and wonderful view.,"Breathtaking views over Shanghai and incredible cocktails. The service is on the slow side (read 20 minutes for a ginger ale), but everyone was friendly. Definitely recommend."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Hits and misses,They didn’t get my reservation right so we didn’t get the river view. Not a good start    We ordered a la carte:  - oysters very good  - crab and caviar good  - beef tartare too sour  - sole good  - beef and foie gras excellent    They didn’t have camomile tea. They offered ginger and later retracted. Hmm    And no petit fours. Hmm

Sir Elly's Restaurant,30,High expectations with some disappointments,"Very nice place with a great view that offers a beautiful ambiance. BUT was not blown away as I was hoping to for a Michelin restaurant, for 2 reasons.    My wife and I ordered 6-course Chef's degustation menu for a full experience. As soon as we sat down, we were offered a glass of champagne to start, BUT in a manner that was presented, it seemed complimentary with dinner. Our mistake in presuming so. Why big deal - the glass of this champagne was almost 30% of the full dining experience. Considering we also ordered a bottle of wine with our dinner, 500RMB per glass champaign should not have been presented in a manner that insinuates a complimentary drink and without any indication of cost. Also, why my bottle was opened, my wife's champaign was not and the wine was clearly flat. It turns out we may have not been the only ones who were caught by surprise as diners next to our next table were also visibly surprised when the check arrived.    Secondly, one of the 6 dishes was a steak which we asked for medium, but, in our opinion, it was certainly more than rare on the inside. Still not bad, but again, expectations were different.    As for the dishes, foie gras was delicious, seafood dishes interesting, but not my favorites, and the chocolate dessert was nothing special - rich chocolate that looks nice but tastes like a nice dessert you may get in any good restaurant.    Is it worth it? Besides a nice ambiance, for a Michelin restaurant, I was certainly expecting more, and certainly did not like feeling blindsided with a champaign."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Best View In Shanghai!,"Best View In Shanghai by far out of any of the roof top bars in the city. Excellent service and they really know how to mix a good drink. The corner table has the best view but to book it you must order bottle service. If you want something a little more quiet, head down to the 13th floor and sit at the bar. Great view of the Bund"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Amazing view and original cocktails!,I visited this place for a few cocktails and for the view - I must confess both were amazing! A must visit.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Great view of the Bund illuminations,We ended up here for cocktails and nibbles just after dark on our recent trip. The view of the from the terrace bar is spectacular.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,service isn't up to par but everything else is,"this place has the best view and vibe (chill, upscale) vibe in Shanghai, Told the waitress that we did not like our ""daqueries"" and she kinda shrugged like what do you want me to do about it...that wasn't the best reaction still would be back"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,The best of the best,"We had dinner at Sir Elly's on the last night of our recent trip to Shanghai. We stayed for one week at The Peninsula and worked our way through all of their excellent restaurants. Dinner at Sir Elly's was a wonderful experience. An amazing evening that started with cocktails on the roof top and then a beautifully crafted dinner with superb, warm but never intrusive service. It just doesn't get any better. Highly recommended."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,The view is worth the price,The most romantic view in Shanghai! Absolutely breathe taking. It’s crowded during sunset - so come early. The tables are worth every cent and the food and champagne is very good - the weather was beautiful and we spent the entire evening here.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Fine Dining Lunch,"Wow ! Very good food and service, plus a very awesome view. Comes at a price but worth it. Recommend the fixed lunch menu. Certainly the best option to keep the price down a little. A lot of little dishes that you don’t see get added . All very good !"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Wow wow wow,"We’d been to the Flair roof top bar the evening before and thought nothing could beat it. But how wrong I was, the views from this bar are spectacular. When we arrived they were having a Mad Hatters Tea Party and you had to buy a ticket which included a drink or buy a package which then entitled you to a table. Whilst it wasn’t cheap we would have got a package if we could have chosen something else so we just got the ticket to go up. I wasn’t keen on the free cocktail so quickly ordered a Negroni which I paid for, this was very well made. We also had burgers, fish and chips and a bottle of wine. As we’d ordered quite a bit I asked if I could sit down just for a few minutes, next thing I know we are being led into the VIP area where we spent the rest of our evening. Whilst it is very pricey £70 for a bottle of wine the view and the ambience made it completely worth every penny. What an amazing way to spend our last night in Shanghai and China - Thank you"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Wonderful view! Amazing rooftop,"Wow! Unforgettable view of The Bund and Pudong, with the colorful buildings. Facing the Pearl Tower, it is a rooftop with reasonable priced drinks and expensive snacks, but honestly, it worths! High class service! Did not try the restaurant (below floor) but will some day."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,14th floor!,Not too high!!! But the views are absolutely priceless. Great drinks and snacks. The hotel is absolutely first class and the rooftop did not dissapointed us! Is our top second view in Shanghai! Eorth coming here for sunset too!

Sir Elly's Restaurant,30,"Great views, but ....","Went for evening drinks here because it has such great views of Lujiazui and the Bund. Of course, it did not disappoint in this regard.  We found one section closed for maintenance (I’m told) and then two other areas closed off for people with a package deal I get it), but there was no- one there and they would not allow us in to take photographs? The real issue here is that 3/4 times I received a straight and curt answer, but no flexibility - this included moving seats to get a better view. It gave me the impression that following the rules was first priority, not the customer. They could have communicated better and more friendly. I was also surprised that some staff members had very limited English. Please not that prices are expensive here - CNY 55 for a can of Coke! We did enjoy the complimentary snacks."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,20,Dinner,"Visually interesting for the presentations, however the taste is not there.  The service is good but prices are too high versus the taste expected in one star Michelin restaurant"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Wonderful rooftop bar overlooking The Bund - well worth a few drinks,A great bar to visit for some five star views of Shanghai and The Bund. Pricey drinks that pay for the views you can enjoy from what must be one of the best rooftop bars in Shanghai. A cigar friendly bar that even on a cold night has a warm feeling about it - not sure where the heat comes from! Great Peninsular service from the bar staff. I’ll definitely visit again.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Excellent restaurant,"I went to Sir Elly in mid-May during a business trip. It was my first time there.    I went to the restaurant twice but with different friends. I went there once on a weekday and the other time on a Saturday.    Their business lunch on weekday was wonderful at a reasonable price. The view of the restaurant was also great.    I went back on the weekend and found that their brunch was also wonderful. I like the egg with lobster, which was out of my expectation.    The best was their service. We ordered the brunch with free flow of champagne. We found that the price on my menu was different from the price on my friends' menu (mine was wrongly printed), The manager was so good that they allowed us to use the lower price.    The different on the price was not big but it did give us a very good customer experience.    We will definitely come back to such a good restaurant."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Postcard view of Pudong !,Everyone can easily get a postcard photo of the Bund and Pudong without filters! Recommended to have a drink before dinner while watching the change of the skyline during the evening :)

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,"Great Food, Impeccable Service, Wonderful View","During a port call while cruising on the Queen Mary 2, my wife and I had Saturday Brunch at Sir Elly's in the Peninsula Hotel Shanghai. The food was excellent and the presentation so exquisite that we took pictures of every course. The service, led by Dorlco Ip, the restaurant manager, was impeccable. Ms. Ip's friendliness and helpfulness was reflected by her staff. With its location on the fourteen floor of the Peninsula Hotel, it has sweeping views over the Bund and Pudong. We would definitely go back."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Great Meal,We had a great meal at this Michelin starred restaurant. Food was creative and the presentation was exquisite.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Fine Dining in Great Atmosphere,"A friend proposed to come here for a dinner, really a sterling, sedate atmosphere for a fine evening.  The service was on high level as well, and the food was just outstanding. There are only few places in Shanghai I could tell which come close to that level. (easier to find ind Hongkong than in Mainland China...)  A place I immediately put on top of my shortlist of top dining places in Shanghai."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,one from fav,one of the best cuisine in town.  can enjoy a good experience or by yourself or with your beloved or with an important client.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,fabulous views of the Bund,A wonderful place to sit and have a drink while taking in the views of the Bund and Pudong. At night all the buildings are lit up and you have a light show. Absolutely fantastic!

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,"Excellent, great cuisine.","Went there a couple of times always great food and service, Chef Terence do it great. On top of best and probably the best in China."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Best view on the Bund,"Located on the 14th floor, this rooftop bar has the best view over the Pudong skyscrapers as well as the Bund. The ambiance is pretty chic. The drinks are pretty pricy though but you kinda expect it if you come to Peninsula’s rooftop bar. Drinks come with 3 plays of nuts and okra chips. The staff are very friendly and professional and speak multiple languages. I’ll come back again in a few weeks when I’m back in Shanghai again!"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Best View at the West Bund,"Whenever I go to Shanghai, this is always my first stop after dropping my luggage.    I went there around 8:30 pm without reservation. The Terrace at the 14th flloor was packed with guests (advance reservation is a must for the stunning view). I told staff at the entrance that I would go to the bar without knowing that the bar area has been turned into a standing zone. As two bar tenders were busily preparing drinks, no one had time to ask what I needed so I just went down to the indoor bar at the restaurant at the 13th floor.    Since the upper floor was packed, there was only one bar tender at the bar of 13th floor. He seemed new but helpful. Then I realised I couldn't sit right behind the bar near the window overlooking Pudong again.    Although Peninsula's Deutz Blanc de Blancs 2010 is still good as I love champagne, to be honest, I was very disappointed that I couldn't sit at the bar area overlooking Pudong at both 13th and 14th floor anymore. Once I had sat there for almost hours when it was 3-5 degree celsius to look at the view. I miss that!    Somehow I understand this for the sake of all guests who would love to look at the stunning view."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Delightful lunch,"It is nice to have some western food once in a while, when visiting Shanghai. That is what I craved one day around lunch time. This place is located in Peninsula Hotel in Bund. The lunch is enjoyable, with good views. The service is impeccable."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,View to die for,"We went for the view and stayed for the drinks and food. Sliders and truffle fries were better than anything in the US and the view was spectacular. Snacks with the drinks were very good, too, but did I mention the view?"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Why not the Best,"The fog turned into a tempest on the Bund with heavy rain and lightning, a bit scary also for the experienced traveler. The Peninsula provides shelter and a cool white wine (the Peninsula house wine) for aperitif on the ground floor near the lobby where all the luxurious stores wait for rich customers. A decent Combo with a female singer and a good saxophone plays old standards. Very nice.  Then up to the 13th floor where Sir Elly's welcomes you. A beautifully decorated old fashioned room with a high ceiling and a splendid view over the Bund, the Hungpiao river and the Pudong bank. Wonderful giant flower pots, breath taking.  Then a friendly waiter, a short menu full of delicacies. I picked the scallops to start and a beef filet for the main course. Both beautifully presented and well cooked by experts, fully to my taste.  A dark red Rioja to go along. A young talented pianist who needed a hint to abondon repeating himself over and over. Fine background music.  All together a good evening and meanwhile the rain has stopped."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,30,"Food was average, Decor and view amazing, there are better places on the Bund.","The decor was beautiful. However the food whilst good, didn't really have the x factor. We each chose 5 course alacarte (1080rmb = $216 AU) which was 1 hot & 1 cold entree, 1 seafood dish and 1 main then a dessert. They had a 2 Michelin star chef recommendation menu but we opted for the alacarte for a mixture.    We had a mix between caviar tuna tartare, king crab ceviche, scallop with squid ink crisp, fregola, black cod, lamb and pork. The bread inbetween was very good - special mention was the black truffle croissant type bun.    Good intimate experience but comparing to other one-Michelin starred there is a lot left to be desired.    The dishes weren't memorable and I dare say that if it wasn't for the 3 types of bread we would have been hungry still."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,"Perfect for a quiet classy lunch, served with stunning views","What makes Sir Elly stand out is not the quality of the food (good but not great) for it’s One Michelin Star but it is the entire package of location in the classy Peninsula, great views of the Bund, luxurious ambience, attentive service that sums up the total elegance of the experience. A quiet lunch for a very reasonable value, without pretentious long waitlist like some of the other Michelin starred establishments and genuine not haughty service is the highlight. Food is good but there is always better elsewhere but for everything else Sir Elly offers I will not hesitate to go back."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Excellent food and service,Excellent food and service If open the view from terrace is really great Expensive choice though around 200 euro for a ful course and wine

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Great views,Came here for a couple of drinks before heading out for the evening. The bartender on duty that evening really knew how to make a drink. The views of the bund are excellent.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,classy,"had brunch there during cny, it was pure pleasure. food, service, and views were all great. cloak is rare but there’s one. asked for sparkling water and mistakenly given still, apologies and replaced immediately. a shift change of staff, our waiter came and let us know she’s leaving. life is good at the pen."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,"Very good food, wine pairing and view","Had a great dinner with a fabulous view at the window. Slight turn off at beginning. Was pushed to go for a champagne aperitif and to place my orders within 10min.  It became clear that “people” wanted to get the s start get home, good evidence is that the sommelier went home before 22:00    Now to the really good things.    Each of the 3 course means was prepared and pr dented perfectly. Warm plates, served right, fine food and tasty. Right portions and timing intervals between dishes. One of the higher up waiters did an excellent job proposing wines that paired really well with the food. To be able to have competent guidance and presentation by people who care about their grooming, way of talking and commitment to excellence made the meal even more enjoyable.    Very good, will come back regularly!    Also, other guests can ruin even the best venues, I had the feeling that the other customers were “better” than the loud talking, mobile phone obsessed WeChat crowd you can’t get away from in even some of the better places. This is a perk!"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Always lovely in the Pen,Always above standard and view from hotel is lovely. Peninsula will never disappoint anyone. Good food and great service. Home away from home.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Very The Peninsula Hotel,"We have a dinner on the 30th. Food was good with The Peninsula service. Nice place, nice service with a great location."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Beautifully presented small plates,I have two perfectly cooked scallops for my main course - a very small main course! They were lovely and served with citrus but I would have favoured slightly more. My friend had a tiny piece of fish. Dessert was bigger!

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Very Good,"Beautiful view, is amazing, the food is very good and the drink too, the Hotel is so beautiful, and is very nice to take photo in the night"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,20,Good food let down by unfriendly service,"This place has a Michelin Star and the food certainly deserves it, albeit at a very high price (the 8 course tasting menu comes in at just under RMB2000 a person before tax and service). If you are looking for a good French Michelin meal the food will not disappoint. But oh dear, the service. From the moment we walked in we were somehow made to feel unwelcome. Through the whole two hours we barely received a smile from the waiter. I asked for the 8 course tasting menu minus a couple of courses I didn’t fancy. Initially I was take it was ‘all or nothing’, later ‘OK but we will still charge you for the whole thing’ (even though I hadn’t asked for a discount). Bread was excellent but served sparingly - again making one feel that I was impertinent to ask for another slice. Drinks were topped up when the waiter could be bothered rather than when necessary (and the dining room was far from busy). I would not have minded but it’s the kind of place that insists on placing your unfinished water/wine bottle on a separate table some way from your table.  I would not go back and to be honest there are better, cheaper and friendlier French meals to be had in this town (try L’Atelier). The kitchen deserves its Michelin Star but the front of house does not."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,"Authentic and delicious food, beautiful dining space and a terrace overlooking the Bund.","Set in an old bank, a wonderful dining space with stunning views across the Bund, and a nice terrace to take it all in. An extensive brunch menu - with both set and an a la carte 3 course set for around 310 rmb. First off the crustacean soup was intense and delicious. The generous slice of pate was served from a large circular pot - and the first mouthful took me right back to being in france. And then there was the beef! Covered in black pepper and treacle, carved at the table. Finished with a Paris Brest, over looking the Bund. An unforgettable brunch - and I will most definitely be back!"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Fantastic food and awesome view of Bund,"The restaurant is located in a fantastic place , you can view the beautiful Bund area from the balcony. A variety of food option with nicely decorated and very tasty. You can also enjoy the live piano."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,10,Beware not the same service before Covid even 9 months later,"I am in Shanghai on business and before the Pandemic enjoyed this restaurant with my significant other very much, so I was really excepting a great evening even though I was by myself.    Unfortunately the experience was terrible - and although I arrived before it was busy I first waited 10 minutes to be asked if I would like a cocktail (yes please) and then finally 45 minutes later I had to ask the manager if I could actually place and order for my meal.    I placed my complete dinner order and requested a glass of wine with my main course - the wine came but no dinner. When the waiter picked up my empty glass I asked for another glass of wine again with my meal - the wine never came but when my steak and lobster arrived they were cold and only thing hot were the steak fries I did not realize I was going to have but they were the best part of the meal.    I ordered a soufflé for dessert when the main course arrived because the menu said it would take 15 minutes - apparently it was never ordered in advance and I did not receive it for an other 30 minutes after I finished the main course.    Once I was finished with dessert I was amazed that the waiter asked if I wanted any coffee or anything else - I told him no I just wanted the check. 30 minutes later I had to ask for the check.    Most of the food I had was very nice and I’m sure my steak and lobster would have been wonderful if they had been served hot and not cold.    I guess I had hoped that after I had to get the manager to take my order the service would be more attentive but it did not get any better.    For a meal that ended up costing $280 USD for one person you would expect the service would have been at the same level as the price!    I absolutely never write reviews and I usually take bad ones with a grain of salt, but even after my meal when I spoke to the head manager he basically said nothing and did nothing so I am hoping the ownership sees this and address the issue in their service - it will be very difficult for me to ever consider returning for another meal."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Timeless and unique,"Back to Shanghai, we could not skip a visit to Mr & Mrs Bund where we had such great memories: the place is still a must with delicious food and unique vibes and view.    Iconic dishes such as Truffle Bread Meunière, Frog Legs Parsley and Lemon Tart are so consistent over the years, we keep enjoying them as the first time!    Special thanks to Elva and Gloria for their warm welcome and delicate hospitality. Great people make great places. We’ll come back soon!"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,10,So dirty,WoW terrible ! What happen here ! Is it high way restaurant ! So dirty ! So nothing manage !!!!!so pity becoming terrible !

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,10,"Expensive, bad ambiance. Not worth it.",The bar of the restaurant is weirdly right in the middle of the dining room. By 8:30 we had groups of drunk people loudly yelling right next to our table. You couldn’t hear the person sitting across from you.    Ordered the ribeye and it was the thinnest piece of gristle I've had outside of a cheap buffet.    Poor experience overall. Can’t believe Michelin even bothers with him his place.

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Deserves a michelin star,Last here 10 years ago and just moved back to shanghai. The place was packed on a sunday night and ambience was buzzy    They have set menus and we ordered a la carte:  - grilled oysters excellent  - tuna tartare very good  - grilled octopus excellent  - steak excellent with unique sauces  - roast chicken and sauce excellent  - lemon “tart” dessert excellent and creative    Service excellent    Give them a michelin star already

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Excellent French food and a spectacular view of the Bund!,"Mr. & Mrs. Bund creates a unique dining adventure. We had Sunday brunch and reserved a window side table, the view of the Bund is spectacular. Top quality service since the moment you make the reservation. Hostesses, servers and everyone at the restaurant creates a unique experience. All the food was beyond our expectation, we had the escargot, foie gras, prime rib from the carving trolley and lemon tart. A must try!"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Best French food with best view,"The atmosphere was nice, my family and friends always love to come here for either brunch or dinner. The meal is amazing. I love their bread and butter. Try not to eat too much so that we have space for other meals. Every dish is perfection and I love love their french toast and lemon tart!!!"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Good food good service wonderful venue & view,"Went there couple months ago with the girl friends. Huge place, well displayed. Food was amazing, as well as the drinks! Very good service, special thanks to Louis and Bastian ( if I didn’t spell the name wrong) , good sense of humor. A perfect dining experience! Highly recommend! And plus, don’t miss their terrace with a perfect view over the bund !!"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Fabulous brunch,Had the most fabulous brunch with girl friends here on a Saturday! The food and drinks were fantastic and the service superb!

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Great French food with a superb view,"We really enjoyed the excellent French menu, good wines, and the best service that I have experienced in China. On top of that, you can take a breath of fresh air on the balcony and enjoy spectacular views of the Bund and the Pudong skyline. Highly recommended, must reserve a table."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,10,Surcharge ! Over price ! Cheating,"Surcharge ! Over price ! Cheating , become really a place not to enjoy French food because of overprice and cheating restaurant ! Definitely outside my French restaurant list now ! Maybe it’s habit of French restaurant in Shanghai just want to make fast money without anymore passion of customers and care ! Overcharged"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,20,Good food but really disappointing service,"I visited here with a business client and colleague yesterday and overall I have to say I left very disappointed. The food and drinks were OK, I would even have to say they were good, but the service was terrible and, frankly speaking, when you are spending in excess of CNY1400 per person, inexcusable.    I eat out in Shanghai probably 3 or 4 times a week, normally with clients, and visit many different restaurants, cheap to expensive, all over town. I never normally leave reviews, but on this occasion I really feel like voicing my opinion as upon reflection I can honestly say the service we received here was amongst the worst I have experienced in Shanghai.    Yesterday was 13th Feb and the restaurant was fairly busy, but not full at around 80% capacity. We had a short wait at the bar while they prepared our table, all good so far, but once we sat down, we had to ask twice to have our orders taken, then waited a long time for the first course to arrive. Once it came, the starters were all excellent, but we had almost finished the first bottle of wine. As the second course arrived, we had finished the wine and the waiter asked us if we wished for more water and another bottle (of the same) wine, to which we said yes.    We had to wait for ages and had to remind them twice before the drinks arrived, by which time we had finished the main course. To top it all, after desert I asked for the bill and also a Fappiao. The bill was handed to me by the Maître d’ and I was told I had to scan the QR Code and “Do-It-Yourself” if i wanted a Fappiao. I asked him to fill it in for me and by the expression on his face, you would have thought that I had just asked for his youngest daughter’s hand in marriage. He said that everywhere is like this now.    He only filled it in for me after I insisted, then handed my phone back to me rudely saying I had to complete the email address. His manner and attitude were appalling. I have been here in several occasions before, and offer gone upstairs afterwards to Bar Rouge, but after this experience I will certainly not be back in a hurry. There are many establishments which offer at least the same ambience and quality of food, for less money and with appreciably better service.    By all means, if you think that poor service and bad attitude should be part of the experience of dining in a French restaurant, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, I’d recommend that you try anywhere else."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Best French in town,"What can I say, it is for sure one of the best places in Shanghai to have dinner with your special ones. The food will never let you down nor does the service. Best French in town"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Fine dining experience,"Good food, excellent service, romantic atmosphere and panoramic river view can all be found in this lovely restaurant. Advanced booking is strongly recommended."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,30,Be careful about food quality down,"Be careful about food quality ! We know it’s Covid time but not a reason to low down food quality I still love this place but won’t accept quality down like I got this time , really basic food this time ( Chicken Breast terrible...More"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,30,Great service and nice food,"First of all, the view is fantastic! The service is great but sometimes it feels like they try to hard, like you are being observed in an odd way. It was not the best food ever but it was worth a visit."

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,30,The most salty food ever,"As much as I like the view as most people mentioned here, just wondering, why is the food so so salty? To be honest, from appetizer to every main dish, this is the saltest food that I have had in a very very long time......"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,"Fantastic food, Attentive service and Views to die for!","Came here for Brunch for a fantastic meal with friends! Obviously the views are some of the best of the Shanghai Bund but the food was exceptional as well. We went for the lunch special which was an appetizer, main and dessert. We ordered the...More"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,30,Great view and wine,"Thoroughly enjoyed the ambience, service, wine and view. There were 4 of us . We all were underwhelmed with the food . Would only return for a drink"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,40,Christmas Dinner,Wonderful meal. Beautiful atmosphere. The service was excellent. These would merit a 5 star. Negatives - policy to pay for seating position and the room was way too warm.

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,40,Nice view,Nice atmosphere but food a bit salty. You can have the best view of the bund. Good place for New Year countdown

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Excellent food selections.,Excellent food selections. Wonderful flavors. Nice little outside balcony overlooking The Bund also. I definitely would return solo or with group. Must find entry at alley and take elevator. Open atmosphere. No wait on a Sunday night around 7.

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Magic moment in life,One of my favorite place in Shanghai. Service TOP food TOP wine TOP vue TOP nothing to add. Go there and spend time appreciate your meal with too rating quality food. Meat or fish are taking you into a special moment.

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Magnificent,Great food and service and fabulous views of the Bund. A memorable night. Expensive but well worth it.

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,omg - but bring money - it will cost yu,We were a group of five and we were all very staisfied with our meal. It is expensive and like all expensive places probably over priced. But if you have the money its an experiance in lusflul decadence - and I loved it!

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Special French,"Very polished and authentic french dinner in a wonderful 1920's building. Sharing style of food with enthusiastic service. This is a special occasion restaurant with smaller intimate tables and several private rooms. Charcuterie, fish and steaks were all great. Bread not up to french standards"

Mr & Mrs Bund - Seafood & Steak House by Paul Pairet,50,Superb Restaurant,"We had an excellent experience at Mr & Mrs Bund. A great atmosphere, excellent service and wonderful food expertly cooked and plated. Wonderful warm but unobtrusive service. Highly recommended"

ABaC,20,"Not worth the money, and you wont see the Chef.","Well if you are not a fan of micheline restaurant, then it is not a place to try. If ever willing to go to michelin atar restaurant the Celler Can roca is the only one(Girona) worth to try. This restaurant was disapointment.  Meals were not tasty, as we didnt find the combinations of food, ingredients or tastes properly suited. Dont waste your time and definately your money.  Moreover the Chef wasnt there. That is pity for these kind of restaurants."

ABaC,40,Worthy 3 * but too much food,Overall an incredible fine dining experience with a chef that likes to have a bit of fun with his menu. I loved the fact the meal starts in the kitchen with beverages that were so well executed it was right that such culinary excellence should show off their kitchen first. Service was exceptional although I must admit i didn’t like the fact that the lead server said exactly the same thing at each table as you could hear the repetition it was too scripted. There were a couple of little accidents on our meal the vanity case handle broke off and when making the ice cream at the end course the server accidentally dropped ice cream on the floor and tried to catch it with his foot which made us giggle a bit. He was worked really hard all night seemed to be the only person able to do presentations at the table. Stand out was the sommelier she was incredible her knowledge exceptional. I would give 4.5 if I could the only real negative was it was just too much food. We felt it could be 2-3 courses less. We felt so uncomfortably full afterwards it really dampened our evening. I have never left chocolate on the table this was a first!

ABaC,50,Incredible evening,"We had an incredible evening running through the tasting menu. The staff were thoughtful, attentive and have mastered the rhythm required to deliver a service as special as this.    The food was exquisite from start to finish. Novel, interesting, at times playful and fun. Some of the dishes landed in the top of my culinary experiences. We left with a big smile and full bellies. No wine pairing for us- just a couple of glasses of delicious Catalonian wine, as recommended by the waiter, worked perfectly.    I loved it and will remember it for a long time. Thanks for the great experience."

ABaC,20,This poor experience makes me question the Michelin standard,"Food was salty, service was sloppy and ambiance was stuffy. However, the course's overall concept was quite fun--particularly the desserts; they were nostalgia re-envisioned. Processed candies eaten as a kid, recreated with fine dining ingredients and techniques. One of the desserts tasted like I was drinking a strawberry hard candy Jolly Rancher for us Americans). Otherwise, the rest of the meal followed played out fine dining usuals like caviar forward appetizers and deconstruction of familiar dishes. Except all of these were worsened by the saltiness of the dishes. My mouth actually puckered from the saltiness. When asked about my experience with the appetizers, I asked if they could pull back on the salt for the rest of the meal, if possible.    Which leads me to the service. The food remained salty, and no one asked if the food tasted specifically less salty, for the rest of the meal. Understandably, much of the prepared components of each course may not be able to be adjusted to fit a single customer's request. But I would've appreciated a simple follow up. There were two more noticeable issues with the service. First, look at the pictures. I found a hair in the white sauce of the course shown in the pictures. The waiter took my dish back to prepare a new one. However, I am quite dubious whether a new dish was prepared, and whether the same standard of quality was met. The white sauce's consistency on my dish is quite grainy, like cottage cheese, while the white sauce on my partner's dish is smoothly gelatinous, as mine also was when it was first presented. The second service issue is related to setting the table. Several times when the staff placed new silverware, my partner and I noticed, not only for our table, but for others as well, that the staff almost ""tossed"" down each utensil. I know I'm being very nit-picky here, but this is a three Michelin star restaurant. It was not pleasant, especially when there was no rapport established between us and our primary wait staff--not to their fault because do have language barriers. Regardless, the impression was carelessness.    Lastly, ambiance. This is highly subjective so take it with a grain of salt. The setting was quite intimate, but it was stuffy. I could hear everything from everyone. I felt that I had to lean in and whisper to speak with my partner without disturbing others. Also, jackets are not required for men. If a certain ambiance is trying to be created, follow through."

ABaC,30,Beautiful Barcelona!,Located in a lovely neighborhood off the beaten path from areas like Las Ramblas and Center city. We walked to restaurants each day for breakfast and dinner as our hotel really didn't have options for affordable dining.  We had a lovely room with comfortable bed and bedding and the jacuzzi tub was great.  The reason I gave this 3 stars was because there was a noise next to our room that came on every 5 to 10 minutes that kept me up and the lack of a working TV. That was fixed at 10pm on our last night there. All and all it was a nice experience and a very clean hotel.

ABaC,50,Outstanding!,"My first Michelin three star experience was so memorable at ABaC! It was the most elevated experience of taste I’ve had thus far, though I am new to Michelin star dining. It was a truly unforgettable meal that was inventive, entertaining, and exquisite from start to finish. I especially loved having the first courses inside the kitchen and the stories behind the desserts were so fun and thoughtful."

ABaC,50,Amazing food & amazing Service,We wanted to experience Catalan Fine Dining and this was the perfect spot for it. Amazing food - amazing service!

ABaC,50,Outstanding knowledgeable service,"Lovely ambience throughout our visit, waiters were extremely knowledgeable of pairing wines, food was just excellent and the Decor is just flawlessly beautiful. Highly recommend"

ABaC,50,First class experience,Incredible experience. Marcos was an amazing host and server. Each dish was explained thoroughly and the flavors worked perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.

ABaC,40,Best restaurant in Barcelona,"Best restaurant in Barcelona!!!  ABaC is without a doubt thé best restaurant in Barcelona.  I has always been one of the top restaurants but the last few years it has made a big jump forward.  The “dining experience”, cause “dinner” does not really do it justice, is fantastic.  It starts with a tour amd some first dishes inside the kitchen to see the hwart of this restaurant and ends remeniscing our childhood. I won’t ruin all the gastronomic surprises but will end with: YOU MUST EAT HERE BEFORE YOU DIE"

ABaC,20,My palad was completely lost and confused all night long with his food.,"I was so excited to go here! I am a foodie and i live for great food! Great food to me it makes my palad sing, I am always looking for a food orgasm. After putting a deposit of 100 euros per person, there were 3 of us. We spent 1200 euros altogether, wine was a ride for sure very different, unique and flavorful! The food, it was a lot of small portions. First 3 tapas at the kitchen, and a celery drink! Then at the table probably another 10 more food and wine pairings, 4 desserts and lost of different flavors! I am no expert, however I was very disappointed. Food presentation was cute, but nothing incredible. I have eaten all over the world and at over 30 Michelin star rated restaurants. Food really wanted to be good but it was very short of being decent in my opinion. Flavors were very strong, all over the place all dancing to different songs, never in sync, or at the same beat or genre. I was lost, my palad was confused with every dish and even 3 dishes I did not like for sure. I tried them again and again, drink the wine it was paired with and I give the dish a second, third or fourth chance. No go for me! This morning I am still puzzled, and feel terrible for not linking the chefs food. I wanted to like it but I could not, I wish the chef nothing but success! Thanks for trying!"

ABaC,50,"Exceptional food, exceptional experience","I travel a lot and always seek out Michelin Restaurants and ABaC is one of the best if not possibly the best I’ve ever been too    As a vegetarian the kitchen has to make changes for me and my wife, and they made it look like this was a normal day, so if you’re veggie or vegan and a food lover, you must go here    The food is simply wow, sorry can’t think of a better word, but it is just wow    The service is exceptional and Isabel made us feel relaxed and explained the very detailed dishes expertly    When I visit Barcelona next, this will be the first reservation I’ll make"

ABaC,50,Simply spectacular,"We recently spent a week in Madrid and Barcelona and spent considerable time planning our meals. We dined at multiple Michelin starred restaurants and this was definitely our favorite. The space is stunning and in a charming neighborhood removed from the center of Barcelona. The first ""course"" takes place in the kitchen where you get to watch the dishes being prepared. The course itself is a beverage and a pre dinner appetizer. They were one of the best on the menu. The menu is extensive, I believe 17 dishes? However they are grouped in a way that 3 dishes are served at the same time. I believe our meal lasted roughly 3-4 hours. The service is wonderful, professional, but still entertaining. Marco was our main server and he was excellent. One of the highlights of this restaurant in my opinion was their beverage options. We had been to a highly rated restaurant in Madrid a few days previously and our wine pairings were either 300 or 600 euros per person. At ABaC, we had two bottles of wine, both recommended by the wonderful sommelier. They were so reasonable priced, I could not believe it. They were both delicious and I was so appreciative of the lack of mark up at this restaurant. Every single dish with the exception of one that was just okay was a WIN. The eel sandwich I believe was our favorite amongst our group of 4. It happened to be my birthday and not only did I get an extra dessert, but we had a rousing birthday song with many of the waitstaff joining in. It was particularly entertaining because we had sucked on the helium balloons prior so it sounded like a chorus from the Lollypop Gang. The refined surroundings combined with the humorous but professional weight staff and lastly the creative and absolutely amazing food amounted to one of the best experiences I have had. I have traveled all over the world, and dined at many World's 50 Best and this is without doubt one of the best. I would go back in a second. While this is not a cheap meal, in my opinion it was definitely a memorable experience. Thank you Thank you Thank you."

ABaC,30,Don’t think 3 star Michelin means the same for everybody,"17-02-2023 when you hear a chef with 3 Michelin star you automatically expect something extraordinary. I am a person who loves gastronomy and use to go to all kind of good restaurants from Michelin star to street food. Tonight we were disappointed bcaz nothing except the beginning that started in the kitchen was surprising. The food was lame, everything went the same way “smoked” “carbonized” and almost no taste. Presentation maybe was the only thing you will remember. The stuff were “burned out” with a very false smile on their face and explaining the plates to every table seemed heavy and heavier every time. I almost felt sorry for them. We ordered the wine tasting with every plate. Another disaster and mistake I did for 280€ for 2 persons I could have ordered a nice bottle of wine but they recommend to try wine tasting. I have tried many and many 1 star Michelin chefs far far better in taste than Jordi Cruz who I think don’t even know what’s going on in his place since he now is a TV star. Money is the enemy of the passion for cocking and we all loose it as soon as we think more about money and not the passion for coocking. I don’t want to say it was bad or anything near bad, NO, but it was definitely NOT 3 star Michelin gastronomy"

ABaC,50,"Creativity, local wine, and great service","Dinner at ABaC is an extraordinary experience - I started at 8:30 and finished after midnight but didn't feel tired or lose interests.    In the food you can find creativity (with good taste as well) and with the wine pairing, it feels like a well-designed trip around Spain (now in Canary Islands, later in Rioja...) By the way, starting with HeavenSake was really a fascinating idea.    The service comes at the level that matches the standards of a Michelin 3-star restaurant - I didn't have to wait long between dishes as in some reviews but that was just my personal experience.    See some of my favorite dishes in the photos."

ABaC,30,Oh well,"What to say other than I showed up and they had me waiting for 10 minutes in the heated garden as they were still briefing the staff. 3 stars Michelin. Then they took me through the kitchen ad part of the experience 😂😂. The staff was laughing. I was embarrassed. They look tired and pathetic. I felt sad for them. I asked to go to my table right away. They were at a loss. Them came the fixed menu. Which in a 3 star is weird. I had the only choice between the cod and the shrimp. Other than that the ballet was set. The super nice staff had done this for ever, they were tired starting their shift. I was sad watching it. Dinner went on with great food but no real surprise or interest.many tricks with foam. Ballon, etc but seen before and again 3 stars Michelin. I picked the pairing menu and got wine just before the dish but not too much. Dessert came just chocolate. I hate chocolate. Result 375 dollars and a 7-10 grade. Might do it. Staff is great. Food is just ok. The economic model doesn’t work."

ABaC,50,Great tasting menu experience!,"We visited this place for the new year's lunch tasting experience and really like it. It's a 3 star restaurant so you can imagine it's not cheap but it's a very interesting experience: every dish is different and has a story, all very tasty and we had a lot of fun!"

ABaC,30,Less than expected,"As the big meal of our recent trip to Spain, I made reservations at ABaC. After looking forward to my first three star restaurant, having gone to other similar restaurants, I was disappointed by the front of house staff’s lack of attention to detail. Maybe it was a cultural thing, and in Catalan certain niceties are not required of the maître d', that would be expected at restaurants trying to be at a world class level. The rest of the staff were professional and helpful.    The food was nice, not excellent like for example my recent visit to Maison Boulud in Montreal. Though this was a tasting menu. It just seemed the story told before each course about what was being served and what inspired it promised more than the dish could support.    My wife spent the night also observing the other five tables - as there are only six tables for two, with a single seating at 8pm - and according to her, the other couples were also confused by about the first five of twelve courses, and afterwards just stopped caring and ate what they got.    Relative to other restaurants in it’s claimed class I found it acceptable overall, poor in value, and disappointing in service. In Michelin terms this is a four fork restaurant not a starred restaurant."

ABaC,20,No 3 stars,It was clearly not good.... for 3 Stars i expect a wow but here was no wow at all ....    So many creative ideal but in the end no good Taste and that should be the first Thing what count    So first and last time for Sure

ABaC,50,Monday lunch,"From ringing the bells at the entrance to finish was very good, the someliere was very good and very easy to chat with best pairing never tryout was great food was exeptionel as expected, my best will be the bun with smoke hill, the best pairings was the burning forests wine.  I will recommend abac to anybody who whant a great food in a great surroundings."

ABaC,20,Not a 3 Star restaurant,"My wife and I have been to several Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe and the United States. This experience was definitely not worthy of a Michelin star.    We stayed at the ABaC hotel for our stay in Barcelona and would see Chef Cruz in the kitchen daily. The night of our dinner we did not see him in the kitchen.    Overall the starting courses were decent. The best course on the menu was the Chinese Box - Eel sandwich with aioli and wasabi.    Once we moved on from the starters, that’s when the trouble began. The onion soup with pullet egg made me sick. It was hard to get it down. Chef Cruz followed that up with an under-cooked red prawn. By this time my stomach was rumbling. When they served the pigeon as the final main course we were sad. I mean….okay, we’ve seen this before but the serving was meager and the taster underwhelming. My wife took one bite and said…”enough”.    We finished with dessert which included both a helium balloon and “the water of human consciousness” which the waiter described as a “fart from the painting in front of the restaurant”.  Literally….that is what was served. Air. Just air.  And helium….as a dessert. Hmmm.    We returned to our room following a very unceremonious ending of this 4 hr “dining experience” with upset stomachs. My wife and I were sick all night. Couldn’t sleep and are still feeling ill today.    The one decent part of the meal was actually the wine. The sommelier was kind and tried to make a good wine pairing for us which we enjoyed. That and the bread. Everything else was such a disappointment.  If you have money to burn and you don’t care about an upset stomach, try this place.  If not….avoid it at all costs. It’s a scam restaurant.  Try a local tapas place instead of overpaying for ABaC. Your stomach will thank you."

ABaC,50,Amazing!!,"If you love tasty food that is imaginative, creative and unforgettable, then this is your restaurant! The staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. When we arrived to our table we were given a menu of the night’s offerings, but they added more courses not on the menu throughout the dinner. Awesome! Plan on spending around three to four hours for the meal if it’s not paired with wine. We ordered wine by the bottle which was plenty for the dinner. The evening was an experience, not just a dinner. I would recommend it AND would do it again if I were back in Barcelona."

ABaC,20,Dissapointing experience,I booked the restaurant for a celebration dinner looking for something different and more special judging by the 3 michelin star distiction.  Our night started by ordering a bottle of wine wich took forever to recived it .. after 40 minutes of waiting finally we got our Penfolds wine  The food was plain nothing that would make you believe you eat in a michelin star restaurant.  My total dislike was a onion soup that made me skip the rest of the dishes and a shrimp with hazelnut ( the only taste in the plate was the hazelnut)  The ambiance of the restaurant was nice but for sure i won't came back .. from my point of view the menu wouldn't deserve to be served in any restaurant that respect itself.

ABaC,20,Disappointing Michelin 3 star,Very disappointed experiences Staff is not friendly. Good looks fancy and overall taste weird. From the signature Bloody Mary on the Rock to the end of desserts. Spent whole 3 hours for a lunch it’s definitely not worth for a tourist. The restaurant is a nice place though.

ABaC,20,Such a let down for a Michelin 3-star,"It is quite a let down to be honest. For a Michelin 3 star, we expected much more. Only good for the eyes and camera. Everything is bland and salty, with no uniqueness in taste. The dishes we felt were good were the prawn and desserts. In terms of service, the waitress serving us was not that enthusiastic either, just doing her job trying to get through the night.  Visual - 5/5  Service 2/5  Taste 1/5  Enigma gave us a much better experience and attention"

ABaC,30,Amazed to get this low quality,"This is the most bugging review I've ever written on this platform. I've waited years to visit a three Michelin star restaurant and finally on our honeymoon we made the reservation. We checked online and ABaC should've been ""the better one"" from the two three star Michelin restaurants in Barcelona.    As a disclaimer, I've visited several different one Michelin star restaurants all over Europe, and this year twice in two Michelin star restaurants. I have never earlier visited a three star, and therefore my observations might be limited.    Service:    This was probably the worst part of our experience. The staff were more like robots: giving out their standard talks about different dishes and wines. When entering the restaurant, you did not feel welcome or anyhow respected as a guest. You were not asked during the meal whether you liked the dish or not, nor were they interested on hearing your thoughts. The people spoke good English so I can't blame the language barrier here.    We were sitting in a dining area which was next to the kitchen door. There were waiters that were literally running from kitchen to the other dining area and back. It was impolite towards us guests and very annoying as you were trying to have a peaceful meal experience. I could hear 2-3 times glasses shattering during one evening and that must be the outcome of such haste. For such a big money spent, there should not be any need for running.    After the dinner, we were hushed to have our cup of tea to the outside sitting area so the staff could start cleaning our seating area. That concluded us being left out there all ourselves: no one came to ask if we wanted anything of whether we wanted to pay our bill. We had to go inside ourselves and ask for service. That was handled with many apologies, as truly this should not be their level of service.    Food:  If three stars mean you get all sorts of hocus pocus during the evening, that's what happened too. I don't want to spoil anyone about the experience so not sharing any further details of what it was. I did feel that all that hocus pocus was the main focus and food wasn't that extraordinary or beyond the two star experience I've had before. And not that the surprise element would've been that special either.    Conclusion:  Not worth the money, especially not with this level of service and experience."

ABaC,10,When Hype meets REALITY. WORST $550 ever spent.,"Went to ABAC at the recommendation of our concierge at our hotel while visiting Barcelona. We were celebrating a wedding anniversary and were very excited. Boy were we in for a surprise.    While the service was everything you would expect from a 3 star Michelin, the food was anything but. For the next 4 HOURS we were Subjected to the most uncomfortable and unsavory culinary experience we have ever had. Every course was weirder and less enjoyable than the last.    From the black goo we were served which smelled and tasted like a plate of death, to the inside out fermented tomato dish that felt like left over pizza paste. From The Luke warm soup like substances we were served to the plate of poached egg simmering in a broth of what looked like formaldehyde, we were left wondering if this was some sort of a prank.    Luckily the bread we were served was soft and we were lucky to enjoy it as we waited for anything resembling an edible dish. The prawns which were served towards the end of our experience were promising, however for some reason ABAC believes that half cooked prawns are better than the fully cooked through variety, and we were once again left shaking our heads.    The desserts, were the saving grace as those helped fill the void of nutrients in our stomachs after an ordeal lasting from 9pm-12:45 am, however our evening in Barcelona felt like a let down.    Not wanting to be rude, we paid out bill and left without a fuss. I contacted the restaurant to let them know of our general displeasure, and we’re met with the obligatory “we are sorry, come back again”.    Having eaten at 3 star Jean-Georges in NYC just two weeks prior, and raving about our experience, we are officially weary of the star system.    Would not recommend this restaurant. $550 down the drain"

ABaC,20,When a 3-star restaurants gets disorganized - exhausting 5 hr dinner experience,"We came here for the first time but we have been to many Michelin Star awarded restaurants before.  The chef made a nice work creating an artwork of dishes. Unfortunately some of them lacked of more flavor or were not outstanding. The sommelier did a great work not only pairing well matched flavors but also mood and location according to the dish.  What went wrong was the service. At least 3 times they left us waiting for the next course for 15-30 min. Worst than that, we saw them constantly bringing the next course to a couple that had arrived 30 min later. Due to that reason they finished 1 hr earlier (actually on time) while we, and two other couples, ended up last after exhausting 5 hrs!!  That unfortunately made our experience not enjoyable at all. A big service mistake that such a restaurant shouldn’t do. I will definitely not come back and would prefer other 2 Michelin Star restaurants over this one"

ABaC,30,Trying too hard to be trendy,"More interesting in producing “creative” food than an enjoyable meal. Unless you are looking for trendy modern food that is hard to identify, would look elsewhere."

ABaC,10,Food poisoning,"Went to Abac Sunday July 31 for our final meal in Barcelona.    We've been to a number of great 1 Michelin stars and was excited to experience our first 3 star restaurant. Horrible mistake. Although the presentation was thoughtful and beautiful, the food was not good and it only got worse from there.    That night we ended up taking turns throwing up in our hotel room and barely got any sleep for our last night in Barcelona. The early flight back home was not fun either. Save yourself the money, the stomach ache and get some tapas."

ABaC,10,"Not a 3 michelin stars, overrated",Terrible from beginning to end. We arrived 15minutes late having to made our way down to their carpark and up to the restaurant without anyone to show us the way or welcome us at anytime. We were requested to wait at what seemed to be...More

ABaC,40,I like the experience,"After reading many comment on this restaurant I decide to try the place and understand how is. The location is beautiful, and i like the set up of the table. The set menu is well execute and I didn’t see any crazy mistake how other...More"

ABaC,10,don't risk a stomach upset,"don't risk an upset stomach. Gambas were bad. I threw up completely at night. Response from the restaurant to my e-mail: we only have fresh products, consult a doctor...."

ABaC,50,Still amazing!!!,"We were back to ABaC. We managed to sit at the same table we were a couple of years ago. They kept their standards all these years. Still an amazing, innovative and tasty menu. We were so glad to had come back."

ABaC,50,Great experience,"Food amazing, staff put great attention to detail, and Jordi Cruz was happy to greet all guests at the end of the meal."

Disfrutar,50,Geniusly good,This was an amazing experience from start to finish.  Every item was shock to the senses and left us confused and smiling with how it this tastes so good.  The sommelier was Amazing too and was very helpful with picking the best wine based on what we like.  The price is a lot but is an ultimate dining experience .  Overall it was a lot but as my wife says it is an experience you need to have and I agree with her.  Definitely a place to visit if you love Amazing food experiences

Disfrutar,50,An interesting experience,"Lunch at Disfrutar was an interesting experience and unlike any other Michelin starred restaurant we’d been to. It was like going to an imaginative art exhibition of food where you get to eat the exhibits.  There were 28 courses so lunch took quite a while as every course  was described by the waiter in great detail most of which we didn’t catch.  Each intricate course was more beautifully presented than the last and with the exception of one or two courses we thought the food was excellent.  There is an enormous wine list of varying prices, the bottle we chose was first class. The atmosphere was informal and all the staff were very friendly.  I’m glad we went but for me I prefer a more conventional lunch."

Disfrutar,50,Amazing,I had the Living Table experience at Disfrutar. It's like a temple of creativity. A transformative experience. I've been to dozens of restaurants with two and three Michelin stars around the world. Disfrutar tops all of them. It's on another level.

Disfrutar,40,Highly recommended,"Sleek and modern decor, skilled bartenders, and top-notch service. Perfect for a night out. Highly recommended"

Disfrutar,50,#3 restaurant in the world did not disappoint...remarkable.,"With this being the #3 restaurant in the world, you think it is going to overwhelming and a bit pretentious, but this sparkles with the food and the service. Yes the food and drinks were on another level, but the service is the best that I have ever seen. From walking to the bathrooms, to meeting the chef, to the details at the table, we were blown away. Yes the meal is expensive, but for something that is truly a once in a lifetime restaurant, go splurge on someone. Well worth it!"

Disfrutar,50,Can't copy this,"I go to a great restaurant here and there, to get inspired and attempt to copy things. Texture will not be something I can copy on several of the dishes = super fun. Truffle and vodka = the plan for home"

Disfrutar,50,A Dining Experience Worth The Effort To Obtain,A memorable experience that should not be missed if at all possible. A tasting menu that will take a good three hours to enjoy but time passes quickly and enjoyably due to the nature of the food and the wonderful staff. Each dish is a work of art as well as a creative culinary experience. Yes this is a somewhat expensive dinner but in consideration of the entire experience and the quality of the food and presentation it is really a bargain for what it is. We also got the wine pairing which was fun to experience although were I to return to try their alternate menu I think I would order a single bottle as the many wines was a bit too much towards the end. This experience is unlike any other I've had and will be a meal I remember forever. Be aware reservations are made months ahead but in my case we listed on the wait list and a few days before we arrived in Barcelona got a call with table openings. Lucky us.

Disfrutar,50,Spectacular Lunch,"We luckily got in when someone cancelled. Sorry for them good for us. This place is spectacular. When we entered we were greeted by the best staff. So professional and nice. They showed us around the restaurant and we could see the chefs preparing the fabulous food.    We spent close to 4 hours in heavenly bliss !! Everything was superb. They are so deserving of their 2 Michelin stars and deserve more in my view. Every dish was a true work of art, out of this world flavors, and presentation. We had 28 course and enjoyed every last bite. Desserts are hard to describe, they are that exquisite.    I am so glad we got to experience Disfrutar. I asked if the same menu was served for dinner, and they said yes. So you are not missing anything if you choose lunch. In fact, I think that is best with so many courses to enjoy and the length of time doing it.    They book up way in advance so make your reservations as quickly as you can. We got the call the day before that they had a cancellation. Waitlist if you can't get a reservation. You might get lucky like we did. We loved it and highly recommend Disfutar.  It was one of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona."

Disfrutar,50,"Food for eyes, soul and stomach: Buen Provecho +","An amazing indulgent foodie experience where the staff is amazing, the food impressive, and the wine selection delicious. Mil gracias to the Team there for indulging my 8 year old’s curiousity about the most expensive bottle of wine and some lactose diet issues. Another Michelin star cannot be far away."

Disfrutar,50,Speechlessly fantastic!,This restaurant is from another universe! We enjoyed now for the third time the Taula Viva and it is an experience out of this world!

Disfrutar,50,The best restaurant in the world 2023,"A few years ago, before Geranium was on the list of ""The World’s Best Restaurants"" - I predicted that one day, it would be number 1. Last week, as we dined at Disfrutar, I had the same prediction. Next year or the year to follow, Difrutar will be number one.    If this was a running race, Disfrutar would come first and have time for a coffee and a nap before the second restaurant would cross the finish line. This is how incredible it is.    Disfrutar is innovative, delicious, friendly, and professional – orchestrated all at the same time. It is not enough to serve dishes that are beautiful (as we had at Celler De Can Roca the night before) – the food also needs to be delicious. The service, not only professional and knowledgeable – it also needs to be friendly and welcoming. It is a difficult task, almost impossible to achieve all the above, but the team at Disfrutar manages to create this perfect and delicious symphony that no one wishes to see it end."

Disfrutar,50,"One of a Kind Restaurant! If possible, it is a MUST DO!","What an incredible experience we had at Disfrutar. I tried to get reservations several months before our trip to Spain after seeing a video about it. There were no reservations to be had, so I was so excited when they called three days before we would be in Barcelona that they had an opening. There were three of us, and we were thrilled. The experience is nothing short of amazing! It was all I had hoped for and more. Our 28 course ""lunch"" started at 1:30 pm, and we left about 4 pm. We were seated immediately and given a paper with lots of adjectives explaining what we were about to experience. Some of those words were: surprise, craftsmanship, colors, illusion, rigor, maturity, provocation and about 50 additional descriptors. The categories they want you to think about are experiences, exclusivity, friendship, creativity, technique, flavor, memories, and sensations. What a unique opening to our experience. The servers are so kind and fun and so very smart! Each course was described and if necessary, we were given instructions in how to eat it. There were apertifs, savory bites, and then sweets. The sommelier helped us to choose a wine we would enjoy, and the wine itself wasn't too pricey. The three of us all agreed that we would return in 10 years and do it again if possible. All of those adjectives played out in our minds. The dining room is light, the kitchen is open to see, the staff are incredible, and the food was literally out of this world! We all agreed that the price was completely worth it. The experience was exciting, entertaining, fun, intriguing, and definitely delicious. Thank you for this cool experience in Barcelona! So happy that you called and got us in! Next time we will make a reservation months in advance!"

Disfrutar,50,Amazing culinary experience,"We went there with my wife and my 3 kids (6 years old, 3 years old and 2 months) and it was amazing :) - Top super innovative food - Exceptional service, especially with our kids We will be back !!"

Disfrutar,50,Mind blowing,"I don't want to share too much because the many surprises during our meal are what made the dinner special. We did the classic menu as it was our first visit.    It's definitely the best Michelin Star experience we've had in any county, nothing like it, and one of the top 5 meals of my life. Book it if you can, you won't regret it."

Disfrutar,50,No Words to describe the Experience,"Being a foodie, several of my friends have been telling me that I needed to try Disfrutar.  Finally I had a chance to travel back to Barcelona and got a reservation. Expectations were very high. From the moment I arrived and was greeted by the staff, I knew this was going to be something different. The open kitchens, the decor, the unpretentious tables and chairs, everything was perfect. And then, the parade of 20+ dishes started.....all incredibly creative and tasty. My favorites....mmmmm....the caviar ball, the green and white asparagus, the carbonnaraand the chicken with the golden eggs....The wine list is very extensive and the very knowledgeable sommelier could made recommendations according to your taste.  I felt so at home that I did not want to leave the restaurant. Sadly, the staff needed to go go to sleep....."

Disfrutar,50,Amazing Experience!,"Everything was so wonderful. Our family really enjoyed the meal, service, tons and tons of surprises. Totally worth it for a once in a lifetime experience. Highly recommend."

Disfrutar,50,Extravaganza all the way,"What an experience was this dinner    The surprises , the presentations  the tastes of the dishes the service ,the food explanations  all pure extravagance.    I Think there is no match for any restaurant  to compete with Disfrutar.  I hope they will become 3 star Michelin  what they already deserve."

Disfrutar,40,If u want to try a molecular gastronomic out of the box menu,"It took me 1 year to get a reservation in this restaurant and when we entered, the hostess introduced herself and brought us to the kitchen to introduce the staff, we ofcourse had the classic menu since it was our first time. The menu consists more or less of 22 plates but honestly I can cut the menu in half. The front of the house staff was very friendly. The menu was very creative and of good quality. It had a lot of showmanship when presenting the food. Overall the experience was amazing. But to sit there for 3 hours was a bit too much."

Disfrutar,30,Disfrutar Does Not Deserve the Hype or the Stars,"Very unwelcoming greeting. Our hotel concierge gave the wrong (but similar) last name for our reservation. Disfrutar did have the correct first name and our correct credit card. They kept us waiting 20 minutes acting as if we were criminals trying to break into their realm. They finally seated us, recognizing we were upset they offered us a glass of ""bubbly"". (Then charged for it!) We would have left but they would charge our credit card anyway. The food is extremely inventive and tasty. What should have been a delightful experience was spoiled by their boorish manner and greeting. This left a very bad ""taste"" in our mouth!"

Disfrutar,50,Experience beyond,"I’m started with a warm welcome. The food was inspiring, creative and beautiful made. The staff attentive, professional and friendly. We had 26 course classic menu and it was a great experience."

Disfrutar,50,Great experience that you must experience at least once in your live.,Amazing food and amazing service. It is a great food experience. The service is absolutelly TOP. It is an explosion of sensations during all the time you are into the restaurant.

Disfrutar,50,A must go,Amazing meal full of fun and surprises and what can only be described as flavour bombs. A really great vibe In the restaurant. A must go. Well be back again

Disfrutar,30,2 Michelin Stars but not Stellar,"28 courses of creativity, yet we left feeling dissatisfied. Why? The service was well-choreographed but not warm, the food was unique but not delicious, the ambience was clean but not interesting. My dining partner felt “challenged” by the meal, which defies the word cloud “menu” that was presented at the top of the 3 hour experience. I think the “fun” and “enjoyment” of the meal was on behalf of the restaurant taking 235€pp for the chef’s vanity project. I agree that the menu was ‘out of the box’ in technique and presentation, but when there is no recipient satisfaction or underlying constance of theme, it just seems like a show for the show’s sake. Maybe I am not the audience for Michelin star dining, however, if I have all the money, world exposure, and open mindedness AND still cannot get on board, who is this all for?"

Disfrutar,50,Excellent,Took the classical menue. A very nice evening with excellent food and wine. And some breathtaking creations.

Disfrutar,50,Enjoyable experience.,"Very enjoyable experience, great staff. The food was surprising in many aspects. We took the 25-course classic menu and we’re not disappointed. We also shared the wine tasting for 2 which we recommend as it being another dimension to the food."

Disfrutar,50,Exquisite food and service in a relaxed setting!,"We have eaten at a lot of the “world’s best” restaurants, and Disfrutar was something special. The service was just outstanding - so warm and friendly, yet professional. We arrived before the restaurant even opened, and the chef himself personally let us in and showed us around. I won’t even try to describe the food - everything was exquisitely executed. We had several different allergies in our group, and they accommodated everyone’s needs seamlessly. And while the food was innovative, it was all approachable - there was nothing truly bizarre or that was challenging to eat. And I could not get over the casual, relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant - it was so unlike some of the other similar restaurants we have been to, which tend to be quite stuffy. We felt perfectly relaxed the whole time! My only complaint, and this is true of most of these kinds of restaurants, is that it was just a bit too long - we were there for almost 4.5 hours. 3 would have been good. After a while it is like running a marathon instead of enjoying a meal. But I don’t want to overstate that - we enjoyed everything despite being quite sleepy by the end of the night!"

Disfrutar,50,Worth a visit!,"The dining experience at disfrutar is definitely to remember and to repeat in the future.    We were greeted by the whole team while we were leaded to our table. The combination of the texture, color, and taste was very well balanced. My favorites are Gilda, Thai langostine and Prawn in “suquet”.    Staffs were friendly and we felt being welcomed."

Akelarre,20,Disappointing,"You expect a lot from a 3 star rated restaurant. Akelarre sadly did not deliver: The restaurant was disjointed from the hotel (couldn’t transfer bar bill etc); No real warm reception; A number of the dishes were not actually that tasty (indeed you could say bland); and No real guidance from the sommelier as to matching drinks to food courses. An interesting place to visit and the staff were all nice and attentive, but we have been to much better restaurants that don’t have 3 stars. If visiting San Sebastián for the food experience (as many do) my advice would be to stick to the Pintxo bars in town - the food is amazing, the atmosphere super and the pricing unbelievably reasonable."

Akelarre,30,A bit disappointing..,"It was a bit disappointing. The restaurant is beautifully located and we had lunch in good company with fantastic wines, but we came to the conclusion that the experience did not quite meet our expectations of a *** restaurant. The dishes were not very distinctive and the service was even disappointing (no personal attention, service on autopilot, sommelier who only read the description on the label of the wine bottle). The fact that most of the waiting staff didn't speak English (which we found very unusual for a restaurant at this level) didn't help either. We had requested 3 wine pairings plus a single glass of white for one of us, but we were told 'the wine pairing was only possible per table'. When we indicated that we would not go for the arrangement in that case, it was suddenly possible, but the bill still contained 4x a complete wine arrangement and also 4x champagne instead of 4x cava. Of course the bill was corrected, but we got a bad feeling about it. It seems that the restaurant lives on old success. A hospitality course for service certainly wouldn't hurt..."

Akelarre,50,You Must Try This Hotel,"Our second visit to this fantastic The rooms are superbly designed and the quality of all the finishes are of the absolutely highest order. Everywhere you turn is a wow moment. The quality of the breakfast offering and service are the best we have ever experienced. It is a €15 taxi ride from downtown San Sebastián, but that is a bonus. The town is nearby, but it is a joy to escape the hustle and bustle too. Dinner in the restaurant is a very special experience and should not be missed. We cannot recommend this hotel enough."

Akelarre,20,Bored to death,"Mediocre in every way, was expecting a stunning evening but instead was met with nothing but mediocrity."

Akelarre,30,Unfortunately it was only ok!,"First time for us to visit a Michelin 3 Star restaurant. Food was good, but not spectacular! Food presentation was superb. Service personal was good and knowledgeable. Maria did a great job in introducing and explaining all dishes to us. However it would be nice to personally say good night to us before she ended her shift. In general we expected a better food tasting experience for a 3 star restaurant."

Akelarre,50,Destination dining,"Akelarre exceeded expectations, and I'd set them pretty high.    Perhaps for some folks, a Michelin 3-star is a regular dining spot. For me, dining at such a restaurant is rare. This dinner at Akelarre was the main event of my vacation.    The service was friendly and attentive. Welcoming and warm. Thoughtful.    There were two tasting menus to select from, and each had two choices for the main course, plus pre-meal bites that were the same for everyone.    This evening, they were all delicious. My two favorites were a macaron that tasted like the original pinxtos, a ""Gilda"", and Consome Gelee with crispy rice and chicken skin on top.    Stand outs from the main tasting menu included a Codfish Flower marinated in beetroot juice (I'm not usually a fan of beets, and this was amazing!), and the Barberie Duck. The consume with the duck was incredible, and I considered picking up the bowl to finish it all!    I don't know what the previous version was like, but he new version of ""Gin and Tonic"" pie made a perfect ending to the meal.    The drive from the city center of San Sebastian winds around the mountain, and so I elected not to choose the wine pairings. The sommelier recommended wine by the glass that accented the foods beautifully, and I could still drive back to my hotel safely.    This was an evening I will remember fondly for a very long time."

Akelarre,30,It was ok. But for 3 Michelin stars is Basque Country is that good enough?,"We are in San Sebastián for our wedding anniversary and thought we’d splash out on a special anniversary treat. 3 stars in heart of of Basque Country, I was hoping for an amazing food experience.  For a quick summary, the food was a bit bland and boring, no course that wowed us on taste on either menu (though they were very pretty) and the service seemed more interested in folding napkins and pushing chairs in than helping me choose wine and explaining the food properly.  I think some of these old established Michelin restaurants trade on previous glories unfortunately. Not really a restaurant for true foodies.  Location is amazing though!  And we did get a little anniversary cake with a candle."

Akelarre,50,A magical luxurious place,"Had a quick 3 days jaunt in San Sebastian by way of Madrid. Our stay here was impressive. Property location, staff, amenities, dinning experience all were amazing! I recommend dinning at their 3 starred michelin restaurants as the food there are inventive and delecatable. Definitely no second thought of staying here again if we ever come back to San Sebastian."

Akelarre,50,Dinner experience,"I spent two night in San Sebastián and I wanted to try a crazy culinary experience, so I decided to try this stunning restaurant.  I have to say, one of the best experience of my life al 360 degrees, staff very kind and willing, impressive food for quality and for the complexity of every dish, location breathtaking."

Akelarre,50,Dinner was great,"We booked this restaurant a few months ago. To our surprise, we got a table by the window with an ocean view. As a 3 stars Michelin restaurant, we have very high expectations. Staff were attentive, food quality was good, and creativity was as expected. It is a bit pricey but worth the experience. We were so full towards the end of the night. Dinner don't start til 830pm, that was a bit late for us and we finished around 11pm"

Akelarre,30,Pretty disappointing,"The problem with michelin star restaurants is that you have such high expectations that you are often let down, and indeed this was our experience at this restaurant.  I have to question what constitutes a 3* restaurant - I'm guessing perfection ....  To start with, the tables on the lower floor of the restaurant all overlook the sea - that is unless you sat where we were. The table was positioned in such a way that although I had a beautiful sea view, my husband had a forward view of a wall and a window. About 15 minutes into the meal the blind at the window was lifted and it was the kitchen. Not a lovely, visible open kitchen - but a normal, busy, sweaty kitchen. If our chairs had been positioned slightly differently we would both have had a beautiful view - the restaurant needs to consider this!  Some of the courses we had were absolutely stunning, but I have to admit that at least 3 of the courses were pretty tasteless and totally forgettable. I'm a vegetarian which I know can be tiresome sometimes but I didn't feel much thought had gone into my dishes - some were just very similar dishes but with the meat or fish removed.  Overall a very very expensive meal and a pretty disappointing evening."

Akelarre,30,Crazy flies!,"We were traveling with another couple to the area and decided to give Akelarre a try. My friends live in Paris and like us are no strangers to fine dining and Michelin star restaurants. The food was good, some plates better than others, a very good wine list and desserts. Our issue was with the establishment. There were a lot of flies! One of them landed in my friend’s full wine glass and drowned. When the waitress and sommelier took the glass away their excuse was that the restaurant is in the country and they are attracted to savory foods. They did not offer us another glass, or even an a heartfelt apology; we were on our second bottle of wine, and didn’t care about freebies but a REAL acknowledgement would have been nice. Go there if you want good food but don’t mind eating while shooing flies! Not a real 3 Michelin star experience."

Akelarre,50,Truly special,"From beginning to end the food was great! The Service was fantastic and the view can’t be beat! I made a side comment to the waiter about a window into the kitchen and the next thing I know they asked if my wife and I wanted to see the kitchen in action. Needless to say, that was great and unexpected, particularly while they were “in service”    We also stayed in the hotel and it was all first class. The view is really worth the visit just to have lunch if the expense is too much.    The cocktails on the deck are outstanding too! Couldn’t say enough about the experience! One we will never forget!"

Akelarre,50,25th wedding anniversary treat,"This is a very special restaurant, we were there to start the celebrations of our 25th wedding anniversary. We loved the whole experience, this is a food game with different tastes and textures. Saying that you are stuffed by the end. Loved every moment. As it was a special occasion we were invited into the kitchen to meet Pedro, that was the highlight. We finished off the meal with coffee on the terrace with those amazing views. A fantastic afternoon I will never forget"

Akelarre,30,Technique over taste,"I will be a dissenting voice. We found their staff to be attentive and charming. The restaurant itself is beautiful. But far more attention by the kitchen was spent on the appearance rather than the taste of the food. And for what they charge, it wasn’t worth it. We won’t go back."

Akelarre,50,Lunch and drinks with a stunning view,"My family and I went here for lunch and drinks in the sun. The food was incredible, and wonderful staff with great service. Akelare has an amazing view, and it’s a really calm place to enjoy. Definitely recommend spending a few hours here one early...More"

Akelarre,50,Best in Basque Country,"Absolutely superb in every way — food, wine, service and a breathtaking view. A special experience that we will long remember."

Akelarre,50,Wonderful Akelarre of flavours,Utterly wonderful experience... Magnificent Bekarki menu alongside a warm yet exquisite service. Worth every penny if you drop by for a special occasion

Akelarre,50,Perfectly breath--taking !!,"My daughters & I had a one night stay here in November. The welcome, the rooms, the breakfast were perfect (wonderful breakfast actually). The view of course, was splendid. Thank you to all the team, for such professionalism and friendliness. “Eskerrik asko” !!"

Akelarre,10,Beautiful view and wine pairing! Shame about the staff at reception,"Currently sat in Akelarre, please do not bother going here.  Such as shame as the service during lunch was very good and the view is truly beautiful. All ruined as they took over an hour to get a taxi for us, with no apologies. The ladies at reception were dismissive at best, I had to ask twice for a glass of water whilst waiting. The lady told us she would let us know when our taxi had finally arrived - she did not and we had to find the driver ourselves.  Not the way to end what should have been a great experience."

Akelarre,20,Tired and Uninspired,This place earned its 3 stars many years ago but it is no longer worthy of those stars. The food is flavorless. They are just going through the motions serving the same dishes they have been serving for many years. There was no dish where I was excited after I tasted it. The waiters have lost the thrill of the service. This is a tired place that needs to reinvent itself. The views alone cannot justify the price tag.

Akelarre,20,The Emperor's Old Clothes,"We had high expectations for this restaurant, but were disappointed. The food was unexpectedly bland and tasteless. The staff seemed a bit tired and uninspired. We paid 700 euros for lunch for two people. It wasn't worth the price tag. Yes - the views are beautiful, but we came for the food. We won't be back."

Akelarre,20,don't bother,"We've just returned from a long weekend in San Sebastian where we had eagerly awaited our dinner at Akelarre for several months - three days after having dined there, I'm still reeling from how disappointing the whole experience was!    According to the Michelin Guide, a restaurant must serve “exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey"" in order to merit three stars. The food was neither exceptional nor worthy of a special journey.    Food - not one dish was particularly memorable and most (if not all) lacked seasoning and were generally just bland and boring. Nothing had the ""wow"" factor which you'd typically expect from a restaurant of this supposed calibre. I have all but forgotten what we ate - exceptional cuisine should last long in your memory (I can still recount every dish we ate at Heston's Fat Duck, another three Michelin star restaurant).    Service - impersonal. The restaurant was too busy for the staff to dedicate any meaningful time to make your experience personal which is something I've come to appreciate at high calibre restaurants - that sense of being made to feel that you're the only people there. Staff were bringing large trays of food out and rushing around serving several tables at the same time - it felt like a conveyor belt! This is not a reflection on the individuals serving us but the greed of the restaurant owner who clearly wants to pack as many people in as possible.    All in all a very disappointing experience and unacceptable given the price point! The following evening we ate at Mirador de Ulia (one Michelin star) and everything about our experience there was better and half the price!"

Akelarre,10,Not even the bread was good,"I thought something was wrong with me when I wasn’t liking any of the dishes. The dishes were either tasteless or tasted fishy. Even the bread was not good; Even the desserts I was not able to eat them. I Could not believe that a three star Michelin restaurant could deliver search below mediocre food. It seemed like the food had been pre made and pre plated early in the day or day before, most was cold or lukewarm at most. I never review restaurants but this one I do because it is a disservice to use a 3 star status to offer substandard food."

Akelarre,50,Fantastic hotel experience,Absolute fantastic hotel experience. Great spacious rooms with excellent facilities. Great choices for breakfast lovely external seating areas for pre dinner drinks. Sits just outside San Sebastian but about an hours walk downhill to the Old Town and get a taxi or bus back.

Akelarre,50,"Hotel and restaurant with great location and rooms, and superb food","We stayed 2 nights. On the first evening in the brasserie, and on the second in the main restaurant. We used the spa. The room was wonderful, very comfortably modern and spacious, architecturally exciting, and with a fine sea view.    The spa facilities were excellent, well appointed and with expert staff.    The brasserie was spectacularly good. The choice was fully tempting, and the cookery imaginative and outstanding value for an expensive destination hotel. The main restaurant we have been to before. It retains its visual panache of previous visits, and the many courses were all of a very high standard. I have lost my enthusiasm for tasting menus, and would welcome the opportunity to enjoy fewer courses on an à la carte basis chosen from the 2 tasting menus.    Though an expensive hotel, this one is worth it. We shall be back, to enjoy the rare experience of a truly spectacular and excellent contemporary place, well managed and staffed"

Akelarre,50,50th birthday,"I’ve stopped writing reviews recently but given the 1 star reviews posted for Akelarre and the description by them of the food I felt compelled to write. My wife booked the weekend in San Sebastián and this was red second day and second Michelin restaurant (Mugaritz yesterday). From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and attentive, the bread and goats cheese butter were outstanding, as were the other amuse bouche. We both had different menus so we could try everything. The food was outstanding, this is not to say we loved everything, I’ll never love a white bean, but it was all perfectly cooked and presented beautifully. We had a great table looking out at what must be one of the best views from any place anywhere in the world. Unlike a lot of Michelin star restaurants we’d come here again, unlike Mugaritz. This is high end cooking focused on flavour."

Akelarre,50,Great experience,We read reviews about this restaurant that were very mixed. After eating here I can confirm my suspicions that the negative reviews were generated by the attitude of the writer…. Not the restaurant!  The experience was brilliant…. The food was creative and the staff were attentive. I imagine the techniques and subtleties can be lost on some people. We didn’t love every dish….. who can when there are 9 dishes and 2 “amuse bush”?  I think there is a mirror for the bad reviews here….. and that is a bad attitude. Maybe they didn’t like their seating…..?? I even read one review that was basically racist…. How trip advisor published it I have no idea.  I’m summary ….. if your in this part of the world and love food….. we recommend

Akelarre,10,I wish I could give zero stars,This was hands down one of the worst meals I’ve had in years. The service from the moment you walk into the reception area was unfriendly. The wait staff was incomprehensible and clearly not prepared to describe dishes in English. But the real issue was the food. We had one of each tasting menu and aside from the main courses (one pork and one beef) which were decent the rest of the meal was borderline inedible. In a place like this you really want to like every bite. When they ask you what you thought about a dish it’s really hard to say it’s horrible. We choked down one bad dish after the other and faked our way till the end hoping something would be memorable. No dice. The manager finally came over and asked what we thought about the meal. I told him that we didn’t like any of it - he offered another meat dish - not the point. The damage was done. After this conversation we waited an interminable amount of time for our first dessert which again was mediocre. I finally just asked for the check without finishing the rest while my wife went out to get a taxi back to our hotel. What a stunningly bad experience. Now many of you reading this probably are going to think I’m just some American who doesn’t know good food and lives off hotdogs and beans. I’m from Manhattan and a few weeks ago had a wonderful 3 star Michelin meal at La Bernardin where they understand flavor and service. Honestly - the pintxos I had for lunch were 1000x better than this pile of overprices slop. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place - I get that you’ll have FOMO but don’t. If I could go back in time 3 hours and just get a glass of wine and a risotto at my hotel I’d do it in a heart beat.

Akelarre,10,Worst Michelin Experience,"We were very excited to try Akelarre  and had read great reviews.  Having eaten at dozens of Michelin restaurants, we had high expectations and I’m sorry to say we were extremely disappointed with both the food and the service.    Our meal began with a lukewarm reception and we were seated in a far corner of the restaurant.  I couldn’t help but notice we were the only non-white people in the place and our seating seemed odd given there were tables available with much nicer views.    The service was extremely slow and it was a good five minutes before anyone came to take our order.  We asked to order drinks and they said they would send the sommelier but that didn’t happen until after they served the second course!  We did order the meal and there was an option to swap a couple of courses, three people in our party do not eat foie gras for ethical reasons and wanted to substitute the listed tuna belly.  The waiter came back and told us they were only going to swap two, without giving us any reason or alternative.    The meal started with a few amuse bouche none of which were remarkable.  Of the first courses, the sardine terrine was the most unique while the others lacked seasoning.  Bread was served and it was underbaked as evidenced by excessive moisture on in the inside.  The lackluster meal continued and included an undercooked sea bass, and nearly every course lacking salt/seasoning.  The best course was the tenderloin, though not warranting three stars.  Perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal was the service.  We felt ignored and borderline mistreated.  Our dishes were plopped in front of us without any finesse or grace.  Our plates were cleared before we were done.  Our food was brought out at different times.  There was an entire lack of attentiveness.  Wine was not refilled.  The sommelier never checked in on us.  We felt we didn’t belong and were not wanted, I dare say because of our skin.  This is the first time I have experienced service like this at such a renowned place which is why I’m sharing my experience.  We left feeling empty.  Not how you’d expect to leave a ten course meal."

Akelarre,50,One of the best restaurants in Europe.,"A stunning array of flavours, served in a very bright and contemporary dining room. Staff are efficient, and approachable, no over formality. Good wine list, food is deserving of its three Michelin stars, although expensive, it is worth a special treat."

Akelarre,50,Perfection above San Sebastian,"Picture perfect property with modern, spacious rooms, atop a cliff overlooking the sea. The rooms are confortable and perfectly appointed. The team, particularly the staff at the concierge desk, are just beyond amazing. The team was omnipresent and had such an incredibly friendly attitude; they treated us like best friends and made the visit so very nice. The vibe of the place is casual chic, elegant, classy. The restaurant is a Michelin 3-star and delivered as promised. The view and the service were 11s out of 10, and the food was up to the Michelin level. We loved our visit and cannot wait to return."

Akelarre,50,Outstanding,"Huge, private, modern, sleek, clean, (allegedly) eco-conscious. Our suite was stunning. Loads of airy space. Comfortable bed. Lovely seating areas for drinks and nibbles. Very accommodating staff. Both restaurants are superb, and San Sébastien only an easy 15 mins away (taxi required unless driving, so I’d rather a twice daily electric shuttle bus from the hotel, thanks).  Amazing hotel and top 2 of the best Relais & Château hotels we’ve ever experienced, top 5 EVER!"

Akelarre,50,What a beautiful meal,"They offered 2 tasting menus to choose from, which is really great when you are not one who eats everything. There are more flexibility here than many other Michelin restaurants. Every bite is fresh, bright and such a delight. The foie gras with 'salt & pepper' is probably one of the best foie gras dishes I've had.  The service was great. The wait staff were friendly and attentive. The wine list includes wine from all price range. We had a really beautiful local white for under $80, recommended by the sommelier. We went for lunch and the atmosphere was relaxed and cheerful. Together with the view, it is simply one of the best time we had in Basque Country.  Side note: nothing to do with the restaurant but if you have the hotel call you a cab after the meal... wait out front and not in the hotel lobby as they told you. Other people will take your cab!"

Atrio Restaurante,50,A Must Visit Experience,We stayed overnight and had dinner in the restaurant. Both experiences were fantastic. The staff in both the hotel and restaurant are very attentive and keen to impress. During our one night stay we had four separate conversations with the chef/owner who personally sought us out to ensure we were enjoying our stay and dinner. This is a must visit experience and the food is just outstanding.

Atrio Restaurante,50,"Simply The Best, Again!!","Revisited Atrio with my wife and son for lunch this afternoon. My wife and I visited 5 years ago when the restaurant boasted 2 Michelin stars and we thought then that it could not surpass the accolade. Surprise, surprise, 5 years on and another Michelin star and they've done it.    Absolutely Fantastic, best meal ever. If you ever visit Caceres, please treat yourself, you won't be disappointed."

Atrio Restaurante,50,2 nd visit- worth the drive!,"We arrived to a delightful reception. We were immediately given the tour of the cellar - not to be missed.    The had the tasting menu based on Iberia ham throughout. Support from a great 4 set tasting wine flight!    This is our second visit here. We have driven 200 miles , stayed close by in a parador and it was worth the trip!"

Atrio Restaurante,40,Enjoyed the meal a lot,"A magnificently pleasant experience.  The service really stands out, exceptional in so many ways: welcoming, personalized, skilled, class, flawless.  Wonderful ambiance and surroundings.  Very good food, very varied, using excellent products exquisitely prepared and presented. Served in an incredibly quick succession of light dishes, but without being too much at all, amazing.  Does the Atrio cuisine reach a phenomenally high world class level? No, but it is still seriously real quality, maybe just on the step immediately below.  All good in the generous 6 wines Maridaje. Although I found them served too cool to really bring out the quality.  Atrio‘s quality/price ratio is not one of its strengths. But just forget that and enjoy."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Amazing,"We had a 24 course tasting menu that was absolutely amazing. But not just the food, the service was equally amazing. No wonder they have 3 Michellin stars."

Atrio Restaurante,40,A bit overdone,"Very nice ambience in the middle of historic Caceres amazing ensemble. Hotel and Restaurant really beautifully done. Dinner very professionally prepared and execution of the kitchen flawless. Liked as well the greeting and the tour of the wine cellar with many treasures. We had the tasting menu with 20+ courses. While the quality individually was outstanding it was overdone by having all courses with components of iberico pork, which is great for a few courses but not in so many. In addition the speed of serving was too fast including plates being removed while my partner was still eating and therefore spoiled the experience. Shouldn’t be in a gourmet restaurant of this category."

Atrio Restaurante,40,Lots done but more to do…,"Just about a two star…    Whilst Atrio is good it is no where near achieving a three star. If I was them I’d be worrying about keeping its existing stars.    It’s meet and greet is excellent. Room great. However the wine tour just doesn’t work. It lacks explanation and context. It’s colleague’s look bored and fail to execute what its all about. I witnessed one telling off a very significant person for just touching a bottle. How the diner kept his cool I’m not sure!    All was redeemed with assurance and a smile from the senior team on entering the main restaurant. As I missed the focus on pork I wondered how a non pig eater would react to what was a bombardment of pork. I have to say that 22 courses of relentless pork becomes too much. Some highlights but the pace and number of courses leaves one lost. It’s exhausting .    I was also surprised at diners atire. Call me old fashioned but tee shirts, sneakers and guests using iPads and over ear head phones displays a lack of respect or failure to set standards which respect those dinners making an effort. A very mixed clientele.    Overall, good but isn’t at the two star level of its peers. Not a chance it’s getting a three star any time soon. Change required to create a real team. The multi course pork concentration is passé. It lacks a show with pizzazz to get it to the levels it aspires to. It’s a case of lots done but more to do."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Superb ideas beautifully converted into plate esthetic,"First time in my life I was challenged by tasting menu, consisting of … 23 servings !!! This amazing food experience even tough being pricy, is worth of its value. Superb creativity, designed in a fabulous way on the plate and … very tasty :)  My menu was created around theme of a local type of pig. But my wife is vegetarian and her dishes were looking very, very close to one I have got, even tough in many of them there were completely different ingredients !  Service of our waiter was outstanding and top professional.  The only element which was a bit not in line with all these wonderful experiences, was attitude of a sommelier. We expressed what we like and ask him to come with his suggestions. However he was pushing us to try another type of wines, despite our clear directions. And it is rather impossible that Atrio couldn’t find a wine which we were interesting in, as … they are proud to have more than 400 types of wines available on premises."

Atrio Restaurante,50,3rd Michelin Star on its way,"Extraordinary culinary experience. Several “wow” moments, delicate cuisine. Excellent service. No doubt they will get the 3rd star in no time"

Atrio Restaurante,50,Outstanding quality and best attention to luxury detail,"A few months ago while at home in Miami, we were recommended Relais & Chateaux in Cáceres, Spain. We were also told not to miss their spectacular culinary experience at their restaurant ATRIO. Oh my god, they were absolutely right. It was a magical experience from the moment we walked into the main lobby area. All staff members delighted us with their attention, care and complete devotion to details.  After traveling have of the world, I can truly say that Atrio restaurant has been by far our #1 culinary experience, not only because of the fascinated taste of their food, but the personal interaction of Grand Chef Toño Pérez and partner Jose, who went away from their busy schedule to stop by our table to chat at length with us.  Thank you all. We will definitely be back soon.  Our gratitude to the entire team fir making us feel at home."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Well worth a long detour,"Well worth a long detour, we found the staff and the restaurant enchanting. We loved that the owners come to your table to meet you and chat. The whole place has a feeling of calm and the staff seem so happy and proud of what they are doing. The food is superb and a visual and gastronomic treat. We also left feeling full - which I was happy about because it’s not something that’s always happened when we’ve eaten Michelin Stars. Exceptional food, service and environment. The wine flight was a bit hit and miss but didn’t interfere with our enjoyment of the evening. We’d love to visit again."

Atrio Restaurante,10,"Prejudice, Racism????","For our 20th wedding anniversary, I took my husband on a trip to Cáceres. I had already made lunch and dinner plans at the Mirador de Galarza (which I totally recommend. MUST try their house wine) however, the moment my husband realized that there was a Michelin Star in the area, he wanted to know if we could book there instead. Whilst he made pictures outside, I went in into the restaurant and asked a waiter or whoever the person who greeted me at the door, if there was any table available, before he could answer me properly, he asked me to sit while he planned to take care of a group of men who had walked in after me and proceeded to ask them if they had a reservation. After escorting them, he told me that there wasnt any tables available. Then, he asked me if I knew about the restaurant and its menu, and opened the menu to its 185 Euros tasting menu. I then asked if there were any tables for dinner and his answer was immediately NO which for the end of July in the middle of a pandemic and an economic recession seemed surprising. Immediately, after I left, I phoned ATRIO again and booked a table for dinner no problem. My husband however had lost all interest the moment I told him my experience. I should say also that as a Black woman in Spain I normally dont encounter this type of behaviour. I shall also say that about a week later my husband called to complain and received the all too common apology, IT MUST HAVE BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Best Meal Ever!,"Excellent! Food, wine, and service are outstanding.  Did the fish tasting menu and there were so many dishes! Each and every one was exotic to look at and we didn’t want to ruin the art piece but glad we did because every bite was better then the first!"

Atrio Restaurante,40,Atrio excels,"Food, wine, staff, the building it self and interior were excellent  Whether the restaurant should have had three stars og not, I am not to say.  The pricetag, though, is a bit steep, Spain concidered.  But when a slightly higher pricetag comes with the use of Hans Jørgen Wegners excellently designed furniture, who can argue"

Atrio Restaurante,40,Good but we were a little disappointed also.,"We (a couple) visited Atrio Restaurante one evening in August. We had reserved months in advance and were very much looking forward to our visit to this two star Michelin restaurant in beautiful Caceres. As we have both lived in Spain previously we are familiar with the dining scene and associated Spanish culture and we also speak Spanish. .  We asked for and were given a tour of the amazing wine cellar /bodega before taking our seats, a real treat.The decor is fabulous all round, stylish, cool and the lighting is amazing.  One thing at the start was a little off-putting and surprising for a place so clearly fussy about getting things right. Within 1 to 3 minutes of sitting down we were being asked , on more than one occasion, whether we had decided which menu we wanted, which aperitivo we would like and whether we wanted the wine pairing .....How could we know this immediately or within a minute or two ? We had not been before, one needs a short bit of time to access and decide. Not a long time by any means, just not to be hit with all of this immediately and a little too insistently, by one of the two main sommeliers and also one of the waiters, more than once.This felt rushed and uncomfortable to us.We were surprised by such an approach.  We did not opt for the wine pairing, but were then(and perhaps because of this?) not afforded much time or much information to pick a glass and a bottle from the list. I did not expect to read the huge list/book , just to have a short conversation about our tastes. This was not really provided. We took some Sherry as an aperitivo which was lovely, a glass of white wine each (seems to only have very minimal choice if wanting by the glass as my request for Austrian or German Riesling was not considered possible at all.) Then we took a bottle of red, a Ribera del Duero for 60 euro, cheap in this restaurant context (30 the next night in another nice restaurant here) but I was prepared to pay up to 100 if a tiny bit of time had been allowed for our expression of preference and the provision of some considered advice.  Our main waiter, a man from Romania was charming and had a nice sense of humour which we really enjoyed throughout our visit. We both opted for the Del Mar y Del Campo menu ( not the one based on Iberian pig). The first dishes were fabulous, seviche, carpaccio, oyster with vermut blanco sauce etc....really wonderful food. The meat ones were a little too rich and heavy in places , for us anyway. Dessert was lovely. Espresso coffee at 6/7 Euros for a cup after such a big and expensive meal is inappropriate.  We dined in the last few years at Restaurante Liu/ Cocina y Alma in Jerez (no stars), Alexandre Mazzia in Marseille (1 star) and Kokotxa in San Sebastian (1 star) and left each of these absolutely places thrilled by our experiences. For over 500 euros (the most we have ever paid for a meal including visit to two Michelin star Patrcik Gilbaud here in Dublin), Atrio while having some really great dishes and being very stylish indeed, was a little less impressive that we expected."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Delicious eaten,"Yesterday (birthday) lunch at Restaurant Atrio: it was a great experience. First a look in the impressive wine cellar, then as first guests (1.30 pm, but the restaurant was soon full) the first appetizers. Extremely friendly and attentive staff and the owners Tono Perez and José Polo came to greet each guest personally and come to inquire during lunch whether everything is satisfactory. And that was it, we opted for the Iberian pork menu and were surprised and surprised by the various delicious preparations. Not to say what was the best because it was all great. We have already eaten in quite a few 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants and do not really understand why Atrio has 2 and not 3!  Very attentive also the congratulation surprise with the coffee. We will not soon forget Atrio!"

Atrio Restaurante,50,A-ma-zing!,"This place is really wonderful. The food is incredible (we had the Iberian pig menu) and the service fantastic. The cellar visit was great - a really nice experience. If my wallet and waistline would allow it, I would come here all the time. However, at €165 per head without drinks, I will just treasure it as a very special one-off (ish) experience."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Amazing experience,"Having travelled all over the world and sampled the food many restaurants (a lot of the Michelin starred), quite frankly this was the best meal we had ever eaten. The staff are lovely and the whole experience was out of this world.It works like a well oiled machine - faultless and friendly!  It was not our first visit - and it won't be our last!  Thank you to all for a truly memorable evening."

Atrio Restaurante,50,Delightful culinary experience,"Was in town for work, find this spot and went alone, no regrets. Staff was awesome, toured the basement wine collection upon arrival, then was seated in the corner. View of the whole restaurant and the kitchen was awesome. Two options: Iberian or seafood, they allowed me to mix and paired with 5 wines. One of the best, highly recommended"

Atrio Restaurante,50,Amazing!,"This will probably be the shortest review I've ever written for a restaurant, as there are very few adjectives in the English language that do justice to this venue. Simply, the ambience, the service, and the food, are all incredible! A delight to the taste buds. No more needs to be said, other than special mention to our chief waiter Gaby, who made a very special day even better! Oh, and when you go, which you must, make sure they show you the wine cellar."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Top restaurant in Valencia!,"Super charming place with highly professional staff 👌 Food, wine and music were top ❤️ We will definitely come back!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,Authentic,Great selection of tasty and regional dishes. The paella was amazing and cooked and prepared in an interesting dish. Good starters and the atmosphere is fun with the foliage.

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Great Service and excellent food,"First trip to Span so recommended by our Hotel this was a perfect evening out. Great Service from all staff, would definitely recommend. Friendly staff who were happy to assist with the menu. Food and wine excellent"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,Fine dining made easy,"Good young atmosphere, probably the most affordable of the 3 restaurants Quique Dacosta has in this building and definitely the newest one. Interesting menu with cocktail pairing option. Lamb was exceptional… slightly Christmassy. Everything else interesting"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,Cocktails and food,"Normally I would go for wine with my food. But here they persuaded me to drink cocktails with my food and that was a succes! Very nice cocktails, very nice decorations and very nice food!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,Juiqe jacosta scam,"This is a scandal. We were 3 people and we ordered 2 main courses for 2 and asked for 30 min space. We got both at the same time. And moreover, they serve in something that may you lead to think there was some quality, but its just marketing, they don’t use the stuff. Its all puff & show. The serving plates are cold, as is the food. The bill is the only thing is not leaving you cold ."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,20,Where to start. This was beyond disappointing,"Before I start have have to tell you that we ate outside and that the waitor did his best.    Even eating outside we expected ok food when the price is in the upper level. We got low-quality and cold street-food.    Being in Valencia for the last 5 summers and eating at mostly high quality restaurants, Vuelve Carolina do not only disappoint, it succeeds at being the worst restaurant I have experienced.    My advice is, chose Riff, Abadia or one of the other great restaurants in Valencia but please stay away from this place.    ... and just to repeat, the waitor did his best and deserves all honored."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Amazing place ! Best gourmet experience in a casual atmosphere! Great service,"Amazing experience! Gourmet experience in a casual atmosphere. Food, service, price all 5 stars Not to be missed in Valencia"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,"Superb diner, surprised by the chefs","This is a Belgian speeking, so we talk quality of service and food. Time that not only Dutch friends write reviews, becau okse they express themselves too often already 😁. Maybe the reason that this restaurant is underscored ? You need to understand kitchen here, because some dishes are complicated. But balanced and full of taste. We were surprised and very pleased with excellent dishes. We chose to accompany our meal with several wines (there is certainly 10 bottles which are open, so you can chose), which were all of good quality. We Go Back !"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,20,Not impressed.,"For the price, and the hype, this was hugely disappointing. We sat at the bar, and felt in the way of the server there. The food didn't live up to expectations. The entrecote was a flaccid, tough piece of meat and not cooked to our specifications (we asked for medium rare - it was very rare). The fried cauliflower was overpowered by uber frying. And we were disconcerted by a sewer smell coming from behind the bar. We moved towards the door and it was a little better, but still there. This was going to be a long birthday dinner but we gave up after four dishes and headed out. Definitely not recommended."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Amazing valentine’s meal,"Wonderful service, excellent food, great champagne :-) perfect lunch ☀️☀️☀️ recommend for anyone wanting a romantic lunch - high quality food and top service."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Amazing Flavours,"We were so lucky to get a table, we hadn’t booked but because we were prepared to wait 45mins we got a table, we spent our time having a drink around the corner. We came for the tapas which we heard were good, but they were better than expected.    We started with a few choices, the pulled pork taco, some Denia prawns both were excellent and i would say the best taco’s i have ever had. Then we had a lamb pastry parcel and a beef cheek dish, again both were amazing. We also had a bottle of Imprumto white wine which is the best Valencian wine we have drunk.    So all in all a great meal, although with the impeccable service, you can see why this chefs over restaurants have many Michelin stars. We thought the food was so good we came back four days later."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,20,its kind of a fastfood restaurant,"its kind of a fastfood restaurant with a timetable of 1,5 hours you need to be gone after this. very nice waiters but they are walking very fast in the restaurant they seemed as nervous as they were making me. but they were super friendly and helpfull. the food looks really good and special but it isnt. its pricy for what it is. the combinations are not as tasty as one might hope. we were surprised by the popularity of the place. the entrocote was fine"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,Friendly service and surprising food,"First evening in Valencia. Just from the airport. Always a tricky moment for diner. But we had a great evening at Vuelve Carolina! Friendly service, nice music and surprising food. Like stingray and spicy octopus. The interior is reminiscent of Scandinavia. Everyone from Vuelve Carolina thanks for the nice evening!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,20,Unpleasant experience,"Good food but the airco was blowing too much cold air that it was a very unpleasant dinner. Even after asking to turn the fan or temperature down, they couldn’t manage it unfortunately. In the back of the restaurant they have more than 10 tables close to a large open toilet door, what a mistake! The team was running around to much, probably because too busy. Not a restaurant we will recommend."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,A restaurant dedicated to the ford motor production method.....,"Ok first up I’ve been to all of Quique Dacostas restaurants ....Denia, Valencia and London and I’ve been to Vuleve Carolina four times but I won’t be back....and here’s why....  I booked the table for 9pm and in their response it stated they would want the table back at 10 30pm ( 2 hours is common in London but often doesn’t matter ) but just to emphasize the point we were told they would want the table back at 10 30. And yes when they say 90 minutes they mean 90 minutes not 95 minutes.  So we arrive are shown to our table the place is busy and why not it’s saturday night. We wait several minutes before we get our menus and no one asks us if we want a drink. Another few minutes go by and they take our order and we get to order drinks and food.  If I had known I would have raised these ten minute waits as they could have come in useful later....  As you would expect and having been there before the food is fine.  So we have our meal and it ends like this ....  We order dessert and at the same time they ask if we want coffee, we say yes.  The dessert arrives with the coffee.  Then as we are drinking the coffee the bill is put on our table....I can’t remember ever being in a restaurant when this has happened.  Then we are asked at the table to pay the bill which we did.  We are also aware that there is a queue to get but also several empty tables.  10 32 we are asked to leave as they wanted the table.  We finish our coffee and wine hurriedly and leave.  So.....  Relaxing....no  Enjoyable....no  Pressurized....yes  Service...poor  But it says on the tin 90 minutes so we were warned and they got us in and out in that time so we’ll done them.  Won’t be back."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,Not value for money,I was there to celebrate my birthday. Was recommended by our hotel. Doors don't open (literally) until 8.30pm and you have a 2 hour slot. The starters were ok but went downhill for the mains. 2 entrecote steaks absolutely murdered even though medium rare was requested. The second ones came up raw. They were then reheated and although fairly raw felt they should eat them. I and my daughter had the duck with rice. Not much sign of the duck. When it came to pay we suggested that some sort of compensation be made as the two steak eaters were by then eating on their own. They had lots of chatting between them but no compensation. Very disappointed as it was a special occasion and was totally ruined.

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Amazing business lunch deal -Great taste,"If you did not know the place, you would probably pass by without noticing. It is a nicely decorated restaurant (Scandinavian style we’d say) with a perfect location close to the old town. And you know what, their lunch deal (weekdays only) is definitely worth it. 17,50€ for a starter, a main dish and a dessert. Thumbs up !  Now if you are looking for only traditional Spanish food, it might not be your first choice. But their food is really well cooked and tasty. And portions are really generous.Their menu included one choice that was inspired by international food (with their own twist) and the other choice was a modern take on Spanish traditional dishes. We thought it was really nice and a nice bargain (especially when you know that just next door there are a few touristy restaurants that serves lunch menus for over 25€)."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,Cool date spot,"Great service. Enjoyed the dinner, but the music and ambience could have been better. Try the tacos!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,worst tapas and pricey,"Bad experience for dining    The food is very salty and not tasty at all. This is the worst tapas I have ever tasted. It is too expensive considering the food you get. The service is slow and not welcoming. Overall, we did not enjoy the meal and regretted to choose this place as we only stay short time in Valencia.    Also it is very hard to communicate with the staff as they can't speak English and their recommendation is very misleading..."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,Disappointed dinner night. Cheated by their set menu,"Ordered the set menu. Complete joke. Ordered as a couple. Everything served as a single portion. If you order all the set menu dishes singularly from the nornal menu, u would get it for cheaper, and probably better portions too (as you dont have to share). Pizza taste like normal oven pizza i used to make in highschool, and overpriced it more for a 5cm piece of smoked sardine. Only dish enjoyed was the cuttlefish soup, but came in a portion of half a cup (and still shared between 2) worst 58euro experience (29euro/pp). Prob get better deals for 10euro 2 shops down."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,30,tasty but significantly overpriced,"I review only where I think a restaurant has been maligned or when a place has few evaluations. This time, I come for a different reason. The food at Vuelve Carolina is tasty, creative and much appreciated, as evidenced by the fact that every table when we were there for lunch,.    This said, we - four friends who live in Valencia - found it significantly overpriced. We chose the least expensive midday menu at an already hefty €29. Shared portions were small but delicious and no complaints. But, when most restaurants in town offer free bread - bread, for heavens sake, the most basic of foods - and, often, a free glass of wine, beer or soft drink,. we paid, specifically, €8.80 for a plate of bread, €6.40 for a bottle of still mineral water and €22 for a bottle of local wine.    We left, feeling cheated.    Yes, it's good, even very good, but beware the unreasonable, you might say exploitative, add-ons."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,"Really nice, but....","I had dinner with my brother during our holiday in Valencia. we are great admirers of quique da costa, so the expectation were really high.  Ate at the counter bar, nice concept where you can interact with bar and kitchen at the same time, nice atmosphere, food good but not outstanding, licking about bar service, that's why I don't feel to give them 5 star.  Anyway, absolutely to try!!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,What a place to eat,"We visited friends that live in Valencia. They took us here for lunch. I was overwhelmed with the food, and the decor. The plants on the wall, the animals on the wall made of paper. The food was out of this world."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,30,Medium quality restaurant,"Good menu that tries to be modern and innovative that others restaurants in Valencia reach but not this one. It’s an interesting meal but I will not dare to say much more, price a little bit high for that outcome. The worst was the service, it took fifty minutes to get the starters and one hour and a half after we sat down they left the bill on the table without demand. It was clear we couldn’t order anything else despite it took time the dinner because of the service; the last surprise: part of the starters were duplicated in the account so we had to wait another 15 minutes to get it right. Well, a place you must go once (I recommended for that first experience) but maybe no to repeat too much"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,Terrible - waste of money,"I have had the benefit of visiting some great places in Valencia and internationally.    This is the worse restaurant I have visited in Valencia - the chef is renowned as being one of the best in this city, but he has over complicated the menu and it's distasteful and distratuous, and has some weird obsession with moussing everything.    On the other had they have great staff and nice pisco sours."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,10,Pretentious,"Service staff is very unpersonal and rushed. Kitchen is very fast serving out the dishes. Quality of the Food is so so. Ingredients are not of high Quality. Flavor wise its okay, but nothing special."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Great birthday lunch at the Peruvian bar,"Decided on a whim to celebrate my wife's birthday at Vuelve Carolina, partly because I grew up in Peru (and hadn't previously realised that the restaurant has gone all Peruvian). We really enjoyed the combination of respect for Peruvian dishes with a Joaquín Dacosta/Mediterranean twist. We knew it wasn't going to be straight Peruvian dishes, and were intrigued and surprised by what came our way. We chose a cold and a hot ceviche, causa limeña with soft crab (loved the lime-infused potato), and patacones. A different galss of wine from the blackboard, both food and wine served with supreme friendliness by José Manuel behind the bar."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,20,We'll never came again!!!,"We had dinner at Vuelve Carolina during the Fallas, and the menu we chose was really horrible.  1 - samosa quite good, but not better than a normal Chinese restaurant  2 - Foie maiz, a mousse with a slight taste of foie gras and a corn leaf, tolerable  3 - Coca de sardina ahumada y berenjena a la llama, a focaccia with a smooked sardina and aubergine, awful  4 - Arroz meloso de sepia y blanquet, too much glutamate in the rice and the combination of cuttlefish and sausage was truly unhappy  5 - dessert, a sad cheese cake with red fruits  We'll never came again!!!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,"Second visit, spectacular food","We have eaten here before and sometimes it is risky to return as one's expectations never quite live up to the first experience, however this was again wonderful. Food of the highest order served in a casual environment. Busy, of course but breat service. Try to sit at the bar for a great inter-action with your server must be our recommendation."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,20,Very pretentious,"Let’s start at the beginning: making a reservation - you go there with eight people and this restaurant requires a credit card number as guarantee, threatening to cover you if you cancel less than 24 hours in advance - already something quite unusual for a place pretending to be high class. Then again, a group of eight peole looses their right to choose, you have to accept their menu...something they forgot to tell us about.  Third, for a place with such pretense, they welcome you by informing you that you willnhave two hours to eat and will have to free your table after that. For a restaurant that was not even half full, it gives a strange impression.  Then the food...everything sophisticated with mixtures belonging to various continents, but in fact somehow bland and unremarkable. Some choices are even more suspicious - such as some ingredients introduced when still frozen. Not everything can served lukewarm, sorry guys!  Each dish comes with explanation and an invitation to “start enjoying it” which makes the result even more pathetic and definitely not spanish.  This place is one of four belonging to the same owner. It looks however not completely like a restaurant, it is more an investment fond, optimized to milk clients.  Very disappointing."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,40,The very best way to have tapas,In a noisy room we had little gems of tapas. Everyone excellent. The cubana libre foie gras takes the price.

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,2 years trying to have dinner en la barra and finally did it!,"Absolutely Amazing. Simple decoration so the client concentrates on the well presented ""simple"" dishes with lots of taste. If you want modern cuisine at an affordable price, this is the place."

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,The best of the best!,"Creative, modern cuisine done right. A very well composed progressive tasting menu accompanied by attentive, friendly service. Every dish felt well balanced and was full of flavor. The menu my wife and I had, including razor clams, oysters, pate, tacos, octopus, duck and mushroom “paella” rice, and a violet ice cream was absolutely sublime. Easily the best meal I’ve had in a long time and also at an affordable price - approximately 50€ each including wine. If you’re ever in Valencia, you owe it to yourself to give this restaurant a try - you won’t regret it!"

Restaurante Vuelve Carolina,50,Excellent in every way.,"We had a wonderful dinner experience here. Amazing food, and friendly service. The Ceviche was spot on ( and not a mini portion! ) and my friend is crazy about Coca Cola and Fie Gras, and was surprised with a Coke-Foie dish she declared heaven. The staff is friendly, correct and very professional, so: it's possible! Will be back soon."

DiverXO,50,One of the best meals I had in spain,"Perfect junction of creative, presentation, and taste. It's obvious why this has 3 michelin stars and is rated 3rd best restaurant in the world for 2023. The food and service was top notch and I would happily come back and experience it again."

DiverXO,50,SO Worth the Hype! The meal is the Special Journey!!,"Chef David Muñoz is theatrical, intense, and supremely talented…and it shows in his signature 3* Michelin restaurant DiverXO.    The setting, the service staffs’ clothing, and some of the culinary presentations are whimsical takes on Alice in Wonderland. And although there are crazy flying pigs everywhere (and the Chef’s image), the whimsy stops there. The service staff is professional, friendly, attentive and helpful. The food is creative, fresh, flavorful, intense, unique and above all tasty. The wine pairing worked SO well with food that they work to create an integrated and RARE culinary experience.    Suffice it to say that I left a contented customer who’d return for round 2 if given a chance."

DiverXO,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"More of an experience than a simple meal. Everything about it is well thought of and considered, food exceptional as was the venue and service. A once in a lifetime experience."

DiverXO,50,Not your average dining experience,"Those that have the privilege of dining at this restaurant should consider themselves extremely lucky. This is amongst the most unique dining experiences you will ever have (in a good way). The cuisine of flying pigs will take you on a journey that you will not be prepared for in any way. Not only will it showcase seasonal produce coming from specific regions in Spain, but other culinary treasures across the world (mostly Asia). The best food I have had in a very long time and I doubt I will be able to find something to top this. In addition to the food, the service is outstanding and not too pushy on alcohol."

DiverXO,40,More of an EXPERIENCE than a MEAL,"I found myself in Spain during family vacation with the grand finale being a fantastic dinner at this well renowned Michelin star restaurant and let me tell you, it has three starts for a reason. The atmosphere itself is astonishing and creates a unique backdrop unlike any other. The origin of the chef will explain all the winged pigs. Our reservation was at 7:30 so of course we arrived at 7:20 and was greeted with the kindest hostess. She led us to our table where they pull the chairs out for you and gently push you in. We started our experience with the Krug 171 edition champagne. Delicious on its own. We then had our waiter assigned to our table and he introduced himself and gave us a brief summary of what we shall expect and for us, it was a 14-18 course tasting menu that brings you al around Espana. Each dish has its own unique identity and is more of a piece of art than a meal. The waiter always explains what to expect before eating and how to go about it to get the most flavor possible(for example, eat this part first and then mix it up for the full effect). This was a long meal, 3 hours, but the time flew by as they constantly bring out new dishes and elaborate on its creation. I would definitely stop here if you are one who enjoys a more avant-garde approach to fine dining. Would I say its worth the price? Yes I would say so. Like I said, its an experience not a meal so you will find yourself talking about it to friends and family for years to come.    TLDR: Not a meal but a culinary adventure with an amazing atmosphere and staff. Unlike any other restaurant out there and if you have the time and resources, stop by."

DiverXO,50,Exploding dumplings!,"What a terrific experience. perhaps the best dining experience I’ve had so far. The website does not prepare you for how lovely and elegant the interior is. The website presents itself so hard-edged, almost punk but the restaurant is not this way. having said that it is not a stuffy restaurant. Everyone was very friendly. Shoutout to Miguel our primary server who was charming and polite. Also the Somme whose name I unfortunately did not catch. It is a lot of food and wine and clear your whole day. The four of us spent 5.5 hours there. The pace is surprisingly crisp so that is an indication of just how much they serve over small items. It was truly an adventure. Especially the exploding dumpling. Prepare to have a great time! You may need a siesta after."

DiverXO,50,Will be back again,"Excellent restaurant from the ambience, service,and even special late requests like accommodating my wife who doesn't like shell fish. Every detail is considered here and most importantly the food tasted great. Definitely lived up to the hype and deserves the 3 stars and place on the 50 best list"

DiverXO,50,One of the best meals of my life.,"I start writing this report as we have just finished the second course of the menu, and I can’t find words to describe how blown away I am. Words like « best meal I have had in my life » come to mind. I start comparing to the feelings I had in El Bulli, at Noma, at Mazzia, at Arpège, the first time I went…    There were lots of emotions in this meal. The place, the complexity of the food, the flavours, the power, the amazing taste. I must say I am utterly impressed. And that’s not easy to do !!! 🤣 So much variety, elements, spices, surprises in just two courses. Wow.    Let’s go back to the beginning now.    The restaurant is located in a small gallery next to the NH hotel. From the outside it looks like an Asian restaurant, with white curtains around a revolving door. Inside, hostesses dressed in very formal embroided suits welcome you with a big smile. Yes restaurants is up one flight of stairs covered with velvet like fabric. Everywhere, paintings and statues of funny pigs with punk accessories.    We are offered two wine pairings at 300€/p and 600€/p which we kindly declined. We order two nice glasses of two different sake, two glasses of Godello and a bottle of Albariño. For a start ! We had some more glasses later but I must say I didn’t connect with the sommelier, an older, quite classical man, who apparently does not care much about natural wines. Too bad as it would go great with this cuisine. Oh well. What we chose to drink was fine.    No « mises en bouche » and no bread. Straight to business.  The first course was already a shock. This is the description : TUNA MARROW AND LITTLE OCTOPUS FROM LA COSTA BRAVA ;  ""MARMITAKO"" WITH YELLOW TOMATOES, CALAMANSI AND AJI MIRASOL ; ""TORTIYAKI QUE FALA GALEGO"" BETANZOS STYLE WITH BABY OCTOPUS SCALES AS IF THEY WERE POTATOES AND O-TORO SASHIMI WITH CHERRY TOMATO REDUCTION.    😳. Hello ? Yes, that’s only the description of the FIRST course !  So you will understand I won’t be able to list them all in this text, but, HOW practical, they bring you a document describing EACH dish before they serve it.    So that first course was totally amazing. The soup made of tuna marrow was served in an object looking like a tuna vertebre that I believe was created with a 3D printer. It tasted and looked amazing. The baby octopus in it too, the sort of kroepoek on top also. The little bun with the tuna belly was to die for.    The second course totalled blew me away. Spinach, spinach root, some special peasant soup that was incredible, a piece of lamb to use as CONDIMENT (!!), and a dozen of other elements to make a stunning plate, filled with spices, flavours, textures, as they call the dish an »rollercoaster » for the eye, nose and mouth. One of the best plates I’ve had in my life.    After that, the festival went on and on. I can’t go in detail on every course. Pigeon « cooked » for ten days in COLD wine (melting in your mouth) !! Crayfish with truffled on a 45 days aged Pyrenean trout ! Ice Cold powders sprinkled on hot flesh. Meat at the beginning, fish at the end. Lobster head in vindaloo sauce, claws in a beignet on top of a 1m high elephant statue ! Explosive cuttlefish spoon ! Deconstructed stew ; Wagyu Beef broth to drink from a horn ; truffle risotto as a dessert… etc etc. All the culinary principles were challenged, and all for the best.    The restaurant is separated in about 20 little round alcoves made of curtain surrounding round or square tables for 2 to 4 guests each. Service is very friendly, precise, fast. Even the toilets are an experience !    So DiverXO is clearly one of the best meals I have had in my life. Top 5, probably top 3, I will decide when I have digested all this in about three weeks. It was amazing. Again : Wow."

DiverXO,50,Unforgettable experience,"The food was delicious, creative and stood apart from the other 3-stars restaurants that we have tried. The menu consisted of mostly seafood which I love. I really appreciated the food descriptions they gave prior to serving you the next course. It was definitely a splurge but so worth it!"

DiverXO,50,Worth all the fanfare ! A must go guys … and don’t plan anything after the meal !,"Michelin guide: 3 Michelin stars - exceptional cuisine, with a special journey. Brainchild of head chef Dabiz Muñoz, DiverXo will bring you along for an unforgettable ride through Asia. Being Asian, the expectation for Asian dishes is high and he exceeded by most counts using great ingredients, showcasing extreme innovation, and procuring mind boggling flavours. The flavours are milder than some Asian dishes like those for Laksa and Green Curry but the concoction still came out delicious. Save four hours for the meal and don’t eat beforehand whatsoever, and you won’t regret coming here. Great service and explanation of each course! We were in Madrid for three days and eating here was the best thing we did in Madrid !"

DiverXO,50,The pigs they flew!,"I will be honest, there is no way for me to describe the creativity of this experience and the range of sensations i experienced throughout this 5 hours journey. I will resume it in few words, creativity, genius, skills, expertise, research, passion and a gastronomical spectacle.  The service is totally impeccable. Attentive and warm. The wine pairing was incredible, it comes with a price, but you will taste wines that you’ll probably never taste in your life.  As an anecdote, the chef read my i Instagram message and invited us in the kitchen to discuss and take some pictures, which was super nice.  You know the expression when pigs fly…..well they flew"

DiverXO,10,Won't remember...,"My family of 4 had dinner at DiverXO this evening. It's not everyday that a family of 4 spends approx $2000 (dinner+drinks+tip) on dinner. So when our 13yr/10yr old asked to meet the chef, we were told by our server that she will speak to him. My husband and I indicated that we did not need to meet David, but it would be nice for the kids since they researched his restaurant and sat through his 4.5hr meal.    Maybe I thought David Munoz would be like Grant Achatz (Alinea), Eduard Xatruch (Disfrutar) and other noteworthy chefs and exhibit a little bit of humility to meet with his youngest patrons. After all, one server commented that having kids in DiverXO is very “uncommon.”    But I was wrong. Even after I saw David through a small window on the kitchen door (with is faded red mohawk), our server avoided bringing it up. When I probed again, our server made up an excuse that he had left the building. It started to get comical when I asked server #2 and he made a different excuse as to why he couldn’t come out. And to top it off, a manager who saw what was going on, but avoided us as we left.    “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did , but people will never forget how you made them feel.” I won’t remember the food. I won’t remember the décor. I will remember spending $2000 with a classless, egotistical mohawk man."

DiverXO,50,Food was to die for,"I understand that David Munoz wants to be the best in the world.  After our visit to DiverXO he already is when it comes to food.  Ingredients and presentation were out of this world.  I have never had so many perfect dishes in one meal.  Rating for the food here is more than 5.  The service was too arrogant for my taste, so less than 5.  The interior was disappointing, so less than 5.  But since the food was so amazing it is an overall top rating from me."

DiverXO,50,It meant to wow and wow indeed,"It is an experience that you would remember for a long long time. Put all your regular 3 star expectations aside and enjoy the crazy almost 4 hour ride. There are a lot of interesting ingredients (baby eels, a whole pigeon leg with claws etc.) with very little flexibility in the menu. You have to be adventurous with your food to truly enjoy and appreciate this place. Aside from the food, the wine pairing is a whole beautiful journey on its own. The higher end option of the wine pairing will set you back 300 euros alone, but you are never going to forget how delicious each and every wine is, paired or on its own. The best wine pairing I've ever had."

DiverXO,50,Amazing !,"We had the chance to do a lot of 3 stars Michelin and this one is one of the top such different !  First of all the area with butterfly, pigs and curtains for each table - this is not usual and so nice ! Staff is dressed like in Asia and not in standard Michelin restaurant !  Secondly the menu is for all the people the same and a total surprise. It is so surprising and not commun but so much flavor in each plate ! The most difficult thing is to have a have table price is expensive (365 pp with no drink) but it really worth it due to the concept and the food itself with high price piece ! The only small negative point David Munoz was there and didn’t show in the clients table - otherwise to be visited absolutely ! Check the pictures !!!"

DiverXO,50,When only the very best will satisfy,From the moment you walk in the door you know you are in for something very special. Expertly prepared dishes presented in surprising innovative ways. Nine magical courses. Wine service was absolutely amazing. Sommelier was truly enthusiastic about each carefully selected wine. This is our fifth 3 star and I rate it as best. Finesse to the absolute extreme. Wonderful and memorable experience.

DiverXO,50,An awe-inspiring meal,"With the rise of Instagram, the idea of food as ""art"" is more prominent than ever, but for those fortune enough to visit some of the world's top tables the difference between #yolkporn or a #cheesepull and truly inventive cuisine is obvious. At DiverXO, Chef Dabiz Muñoz goes one step further, turning dinner into a performance complete with ""set"" changes, themes, a costumed staff and dialogue - there is even a complete playbill that arrives as cards preceding each course.    Currently Madrid’s only Michelin 3* Restaurant, its location inside NH Collection seeing a revolving door give way to “the hedonistic, greedy and creative world” of its Chef, diners fortunate enough to secure a reservation will be taken on a journey during which precedent is cast aside in favor of fantasy and flawless service.    €250 for the Tasting menu, Asian influence and exotic Ingredients abound, it is after passing by flying Pigs, Ants, Butterflies and more that diners find themselves divided by varying cloths such that each dish or “canvas” is a surprise unto itself.    Undersold by describing each dish individually, the first six items embracing Muñoz’s love of Thai Street Food, one will quickly realize that despite DiverXO’s styling the bulk of its cookery relies on grills, stoves and fire rather than molecular or modernist technique.    Changing the menu with far more frequency than many of the W50B, in a way that suggests unbridled creativity, “course” two uses Yakitori Fish as Condiments to a Salad inspired by lost product while “Crunchy Texture Ceviche” offers snappy Baby Eels in complex heat prior to a one-bite XLB filled by Cuttlefish, Pork and Chili Paste.    Relying on surprise with Fried Eggs and Black Pudding, its second half revealed with similar flavor but alternate texture, “Sea Noodles” resemble something emerging from the depths before a supple Pigeon Leg tenderized by Wine alongside Noodles made of Gelatin with Eggs of Hen and Sturgeon.    Undoubtedly inspired by Dali, and wearing that fact on his sleeve with “Galician Lobster Waking up on the Beaches of Goa,” Muñoz unveils a masterpiece in three Indian ideas complete with an elongated Elephant before continuing with Grilled Monkfish and vibrant green Gazpacho.    Next showing off A5 Kagoshima Wagyu, before serving it sucked from a Bone, there is little surprise when Rabbit Brains arrive as a palate cleanser preceding buttered Risotto and a White Chocolate Orb with Black Olives, Truffles and Rhubarb.    Suggesting “avant-garde cuisine in which everything is possible,” including Black Currant Bubblegum that somehow makes Garlic for Dessert work, Japanese Bombons come atop motorized Mad Hatter’s hats to complete an experience that truly reinvents the idea of “exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey."""

DiverXO,50,Dreaming about returning,"We had a chance to visit David Munoz’s flagship restaurant in Madrid December 2019.  The extravagant 40 years old chef develops 35-40 new dishes every year. His very unique cooking style with his extraordinary creativity results a perfect dining experience. He is bravely mixing Mediterranean, Asian and South American ingredients into art on the plate.  The dining room is a reflection of his extravagant style. Fancy decor with pink colour dominations, lot of curtains and theatrical elements like flying pigs all over.  After the welcome drinks ( Grosset Grand Rose champagne with pink label) the meal started with canopes.  The cantonese chicken, the sheep's milk and maturated salmon croquette and the taco was a very impressive warming up, all were delicious with plenty of flavour.  This was followed by some Indian dishes. A very deep flavour vindaloo curry was balanced with greek yoghurt, Dal Makhani & Frog leg prepared like buttered chicken masala, with papadum of lentils. Pan puri filled with New Delhi salmorejo and Joselito's coppa. Very special steamed, light and fluffy naan with truffle and Mumbai flower with pink pepper. The spices were beautifully balanced in all Indian dishes.  Than we went to China. Roman style kokotxa was served together with Necora chilli crab and it was followed by one of the most successful dish of the meal, Xialongbao Xo Iberian soup dumpling with aged beef rib & bone marrow. All the elements were precisely flavoured and cooked.  And many, more and more beautiful dishes. Red mullet and smoked eel, The sea urchin we had to eat from our hand. That was followed by and another great dish, suckling pig skin with squids, matured tomatoes, Habanero puree. Idiazabal cheese, frozen green lemon and coriander root. The suckling pig skin was crispy and light, the light sweetness of the matured tomato was in perfect balance with the savoury of the cheese, the sourness of green lemon with coriander and the creamy Habanero pure. This was a terrific dish.  Red mullet with Moroccan lemon, smoked chorizo juice and Olluco puree. A lovely dish with rich flavour was carefully balanced. Kagoshima wagyu fillet steak. A high quality, A5 grade , perfectly marbled, very high quality Kobe beef cooked to perfection.  His 25 courses menu was a fantastic gastronomic journey around the world.  With this wonderful diner we had a wonderful wine, one of my favourite Spanish white wines, a bottle of As Sortes from Rafael palacios’s winery. The presentation was extraordinary, the service was top level, smooth and friendly all the way through the 3,5 hours dining time.  I am sure this was not our last visit to this fabulous place."

DiverXO,50,"True Creativity, Amazing Taste, Masterfully Delivered",The restaurant encompasses all of the senses. From the moment you arrive to the point of final submission you have been thorouhly stimulated and satiated. Upon arival to the restaurant all of the visual cues let you know something very creative and special is about to happen. There are no dissapointments. Truly a very special culinary experience.

DiverXO,50,From Milano to Madrid,"We first saw Chef Muñoz during the Masterchef Italia competition (aired in 2019), where contestants had to work at his restaurant in Madrid, DiverXO. We came from Milano to dine at DiverXO in January 2020.  A culinary experience out of this world.  Prepare yourselves, go to DiverXO with an open mind and you will for sure appreciate the Chef’s tasting menu. The different courses have the taste of European, Peruvian, Japanese, Indian, Korean, etc… A tour all around the world, just by sitting at the table in this extraordinary restaurant.  Upon reservation, we asked for an Italian-speaking waitress/waiter, in order to better understand the explanation for each dish. We were assigned an Italian waitress who guided us through this experience and was very helpful, nice and professional during our 18 courses tasting menu.  How to explain the experience at DiverXO? One of a kind.  Everything was perfect, form the visit to the wine cellar, to the room kept at 16°C dedicated to the handling of raw ingredients and desserts, to the actual kitchen, with an astonishing number of professionals of the Chef’s team.  Like art in a museum, whoever can understand this kind of culinary philosophy will surely remain full of marvel and the dishes are surely incredible, almost moving. All the senses are satisfied during this experience.  Thanks again to Chef David Muñoz for taking the time to leave his place in the kitchen to take a picture with us.  Just one thing to underline: the wine list is surely well equipped, pages and pages of different wines form all over the world, however we found just one red wine and just one white wine from Italy. That’s a bit thin!  Overall, a culinary experience that is worth the travel, we cannot find the right word to describe it: my daughter suggested an Italian word, which doesn’t really have a proper translation in English: commuovente."

DiverXO,50,Just Amazing.,"Just Amazing.  To come over, here is a whole experience. It is like food Disney Land. The chef made art with food, and it is an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  No budget place. Dinner for two with wine will run well over USD$700, and you must make a reservation with weeks in advance."

DiverXO,50,I don't have the words,"We visited Diverxo for my husband's birthday and what a great it was.  From arrival to leaving there wasn't a thing to be faulted. We were greeted by the staff and taken on a tour of the kitchen which was just wonderful. To see all the chefs involved in creating our epic meal was just wow... We were seated and our waiter Jose introduced himself. Massive praise for him he was friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. Then our amazing journey began... There aren't any words to describe the food as well as I'd like, it was exceptional! The attention to detail was fabulous even down to the spatula style cutlery to gather up every taste of food was an amazing idea. Every course was the best course ☺ not sure how you'd pick out of all the food that was served. We left very full and very happy.. What an absolutely perfect birthday.."

DiverXO,50,"Honestly, i have been to a","Honestly, i have been to a few 3 star restaurant, but this one is my absolut favorit!!! Why? Here some points:    Service is unlike many of those high end reataurant not intrusive, they make you feel special kind of homy cosy attentive but not over attentive where you feel like someone is spyiing on you! Special thanks to Clarissa sei grande!    Place is just mindbubbling like dipping in to a bizarr world apart! I loved it!    Culinary wise its a voyage of flavour textures that made my mind blow away.    Congrats to a young great chef and his whole crew!!  Thanks to all for a wonderful night in a culnary trip that i wont forget!  Salvatore"

DiverXO,30,"Nice staff, food ok but not","Nice staff, food ok but not great. I personally find all the restaurant with a very questionable sense of esthetic. I have been in provocative restaurants like The Alchemist in Copenhagen but this one simply don’t work totally, and the food is not 3 Michelin star in my opinion, maybe 2 if we are kind"

DiverXO,30,Decent meal but overrated.,"I just finished touring Spain where I ate at El Cellar Con Roca, Disfrutar, Lasarte, DiverXO and Terraza Casino/Paco Roncero. They are all great restaurants except DiverXO. Indeed, in Madrid, my meal at Terraza Casino/Paco Roncero was significantly better than DiverXO.    Several of the courses were pretty but were average in taste. In particular the indian inspired early courses while OK were not better than that from an average indian restaurant. Service was also spotty. Many times we needed to try to get a waiters attention to have water or wine refilled. The bill at DiverXO was more than the other 4 restaurants and came no where near the experience. In fact the bill at DiverXO was almost twice that of Terraza Casino because the food and wine were higher priced.    The place has a hip feel and is a cool atmosphere but I wouldn't go again. I don't understand the 3 michelin stars."

DiverXO,10,After visiting 100's of top restaurants there is bound to be one bad one.,"My wife and I have traveled the world for food, it has became a passion. In these travels we have ate at top 50 restaurants on 6 continents and in all of those travels the lack of care by DiverXO is without question the worst in the world. When we visit restaurants we often find that the food is 1/2 of the experience and the care by their staff is the other 1/2. I feel very confident in saying the service at DiverXO has to be the absolute worst in the world.    I don't know if it is because they have had such demand that they no longer care, or if they are just resting on the food and not caring about the customer. We booked a trip to the Madrid and San Sebastian area and secured reservations at 10 different Michelin Stared restaurants for my wife and two of our friends. Three weeks before the trip our friend had to have surgery and was no longer able to attend. We immediately reached out to all 10 restaurants and 9 of the 10 showed amazing customer service. the one exception is DiverXO. They stated we could either cancel or pay for the two extra meals. when I requested to speak with a manager they stated the same thing and were very unhelpful. at one point even saying ""you should have planned better"". How do you plan for an unexpected surgery? This shows an amazing lack of empathy and care about the customer.    Even with me writing this review I am positive they do not care, because they are still sold out. However, if you have a choice of places to visit, in an area with such great food, choose somewhere else that cares about their guests."

DiverXO,50,Fabulous,"Beautiful space. Interesting. Innovative. Comfortable with probably the best dining chairs I have ever sat in. (which is just as well because the meal lasts around 4 hours). Maybe a bit overlit for me but at least you can see the fabulous food!  Service was absolutely top notch and more or less flawless. The food - 23 or small plates - was truly wonderful... modern, inventive with, in general, superb balance of flavours. Nothing seemed gimmicky or unnecessary. Fixed menu only (with some variation possible for food allergies) but no vegan/veggie options.Really worth the visit."

DiverXO,50,Amazing Amazing Meal!,"From the moment you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by magic. This was such a great and special evening! The servers were welcoming, we were given an informative tour of the kitchen, and were able to meet the head chef. All of the courses were beautiful and were full of many amazing flavors. There was such a great variety of flavors. We especially loved the desserts, as they were incredible! Special thank you to Alberto for making the night a lot more fun based on his great service!"

DiverXO,50,Great!!,"Exceptional experience, fantastic food, unbeatable attention. An experience worth living once in a lifetime"

DiverXO,50,Magic in the Culinary World,"Bite by bite you’ll travel and bite by bite you’ll explore new sensations that you never would have imagined were possible through food alone. It’s something that only Dabiz Muñoz’s creativity can show you. His unique way to interpret the World’s finest and most well known dishes will reintroduce you to the classics, like Diverxo’s version of cheese naan, and make you aware of different senses, like the moment you eat sea urchin from your own hand. Whatever the dish, through insightful combinations of unusual ingredients he will bring about an explosion of flavors that awaken new places in your palate. Simply put, you’ve never experienced something like this before and, believe me, once you do get the chance to experience it, you’ll get to value the magic that can be created in the culinary world."

DiverXO,50,Divine,If you have the opportunity to get a reservation: do not doubt. You'll never have a 3-star Michellin experience like this. Maybe that is the only negative part: Thomas Keller becomes an ordinary guy... :-)

DiverXO,50,Best Culinary Experience of a lifetime,"There is not much more to say... simply delicious, amazing and one of a kind. A must do at least once in your life"

DiverXO,50,Fantastic,"Delicate and flawless preparation of multiple dishes that leave you wanting more. I found that on the majority of dishes the dishes were full of flavor, complex and with purpose.    Other fine dining restaurants such as santceloni are doing a little too much molecular gastronomy with no purpose or overall great tasting dish. I felt that diver XO with multitude of flavors is definitely deserving of the 3rd star and denomination as one of the best restaurants in the world. For somebody not interested in a 25 course meal at such an expensive price, I would check out street XO."

DiverXO,50,Event dinner!,"This is the best of Madrid. A 23 course tasting menu that is unique and each bite a glorious orgasm of flavors and the presentations so playful. Our favorites of the 3-4 hour meal were the kobe, the smoked caviar and the monk fish with jalapeño gaspacho. Although we aren’t desert eaters, each desert was amazing. Go for the wine pairing and a nice cava alongside. The wait staff was very good and explained each dish in detail as you go. The decor is unusual just like the food."

DiverXO,40,Committed Dining,"The food just keeps coming. I have to say that 3.5 hours of eating 25+ coursed of food is a daunting task. I wish that restaurants that insist on this style of service would allow us to share. There is simply too much food! The food and servcie were definetly top notch, as a 2-star establishment should be. If you can snag a ticket go for the experience, and go hungry!"

DiverXO,30,Far from meeting expectations,"We have been a group of 6, looking forward to a lasting culinary experience. Having read through some of the critics of the place, expectations have admittedly been quite high.  We went for the large menu selection, being aware this might be a bit of a stretch which it was.  Why only an average rating? Service was nice and attentive, but just not up to the standard they promise. Also, we gave the sommelier (who we believe was just another standard waiter) free hand with wine selection which unfortunately didn't yield a superior result in wine pairing and selection. They did stay on the relative cheap side of things, which I appreciate, but the selection we got was rather random.    Food was nicely prepared, but felt to be more aiming at making a visual impression rather than being exceptionally tasty and interesting. There was no red line throughout the meal, rather a lose combination of ideas the chef wanted to realise."

DiverXO,10,Ended up in the hospital...,"Last month 4 friends went here for dinner and although the experience was great and the service and food was above expectations, 3 of the 4 friends were really sick on the next days, (2 of us ended up in the hospital). I dont believe in such being a coincidence or bad luck...    I sent and email without reply and the person who made the reservation called and was stated that they had an external company for this situation, they just asked for some further details and never went back.    When you are in the bathroom and in the hospital throwing up more than 20 times a day during two days, the last thing that you want is to have to go to the restaurant and make an official complaint. When it took several months to get a table and it is a 3 michelin stars restaurant you expect that they will put more attention on something like this...    Risk of being several days sick doesnt make it worth it."

DiverXO,50,Nice,"Tipical modern restaurant, friendly staff and perfect good. We were here yesterday and was everything good :)"

DiverXO,50,Plenty and great food,We really enjoyed our 23 coursemeal at Diver XO. It was a culinary triparound the world starting in India. Dishes were balanced in taste and extremely creative.

DiverXO,50,"Lots of food, and a lots of laughs","I’m wondering how to describe a restaurant experience like DiverXO without spoiling the fun. David takes you on a journey through the unknown with a lot of surprises on its way. We had a wonderful time, and the experience were as fun as we had expected. A lots of food, and a lots of laughs. We really really enjoyed our self. A great experience    The only complaint we have is that they did not have any wine pairing, or something equal. It is not about having the perfect wine or cocktail per dish with a match made in heaven. In my opinion there should be away to enjoy good wine selected for the dinner. The bottles we had were however amazing."

DiverXO,50,The most fun and memorable dinner !!!,"I made reservation for dinner around 1 month ago and very fortunate to get a table. This is probably the best michelin star restaurant among the ones (some are also 3 stars) I tried in different countries. Each dish is so creatively thought of and put together in beautiful art plating with each bite full of flavors. The dishes are inspired by both western and asian cuisines. The 3 hour long dinner is filled with fun, surprises and joy for me. This is also the most valued for money michelin star restaurant as they served like over 20 tasting plates, totally worth every cent !!"

DiverXO,50,Out of this world!,"One of the greatest gastronomic experience of our lives, by far. What you eat and experience at DiverXo is out of this world. It’s not just that the food is amazing from the beginning till the end. Taste, texture, creativity, innovation, cooking wisdom and superb products. What else can you dream about? In addition, DiverXo’s crew and the service are simply outstanding. Congratulations to the whole team!!!"

DiverXO,50,Truly exceptional restaurant,David Munoz is a genius and his restaurant is one of the best i have experienced. for the last 40years. Inventive food but also delicious food. All the boundaries are broken but the new world that Munoz is building is simply terrific.  To be tried at least once in a lifetime

DiverXO,50,"Phantasmagoria or ""Vanguardia o morir""...","Once you enter the Diverxo then you enter an another world... Full of colors, flavors, feelings and emotions... There is no other experience like this... This place is not just a wonderful ""maison de bouche"" but a real earthquake. We were told and have read so many things about the Chef Dabiz Munoz that we wonder if he was real... And the fact is that He is real and much more crazy and innovative than expected. This moment was not only a meal but an extraordinary experience. Some could say that it is too much but everything is perfectly organized, done, inspired and imagined. Of course, you definitely need to love pork and you do have to know perfectly the spanish wines if you want to appreciate everything but it is a true journey. Don't forget to be very hungry also and to have time... As this was our very first time there, we were proposed the ""little menu El Xow"" about 2 and 1/2 hours but there is also ""the full El Xef"" menu which is 3 and 1/2 hours... It is so difficult to explain what we felt but the best way I could describe is that I only understood completely the presenting video from the website after that experience and the video reflect exactly the sensations... Add to that a tour of the kitchen and a meeting with the Chef Dabiz then you realize how unbelievable was that moment... Thank very much again for everything and for being so creative and friendly, thank you Mister Munoz"

DiverXO,50,Very Creative great food,"Very intense experience with the best service and Creative food. Living now in Asia I get the subtleties of the fusion dishes from Daviz. Decoration a little over the top, with an impeccable enjoyable service. Is like travelling the world in one table"

Arzak,50,V good traditional fine dining,"Had a good visit here with a knowledge of Michelin fine dining. I'd definitely describe this as elegant, traditional style that some may think is too safe, others would prefer that. Eg front of house are exactly that and what happens in the kitchen a bit of a mystery.    Memorable service staff with some real characters, almost comedy at times with lots of people doing things all at the same time.    Really nice talks with Elena. Worth a try if you want to celebrate and have that classic fine dining experience."

Arzak,20,A tourist trap,"The wife and I travel to destinations with good food. Unfortunately we was very disappointed after a visit to Arzak     The way the food was arranged was nice, but also as you should expect from a 3 star restaurant.    The food itself didn't have a lot of surprises, which is what we often experience on Michelin restaurants. It was tender, but again nothing that deserves 3 stars    The room was small, filled with 8 tables, and 21 guests and the noice level too high. It was a busy serving, too many waiters just running around, sometimes just standing in the room look at us,, they should discretely be there, and not take up so much space    Used plates were place on a table just behind us, noice from the kitchen loud, not a nice setting    One of the dishes came while we were still eating the previous one, placed on a table and just waiting. Replaced so fast that I didn't get a chance to order a new glass of wine    Took wine by the glass, good at okay price, but not presented at all. The waiters actually appeared arrogant, and sometimes you felt they were talking about you    Again food, was okay, but nothing special, I would any day choose restaurants like AOC, Geranium in Denmark or Delta in Athens, which are far above the experience we got here,, a tourist trap where the fact you can say you have been there, is more important than the quality,, price 654 EUR incl 7 glass of wine"

Arzak,50,Perfection,"Best eating experience of my life, true food art, and theatre combined. Just the correct balance of spectacular food, wine, and easy welcoming table service. Perfection."

Arzak,50,"Sublime food, Great Ambiance, and the most personable Chef Proprietor","An institution of San Sebastian that is worth every penny, or euro and shouldn't be missed. As foodies we have been fortunate to have visited many michelin starred restaurants around the world. We have to save for it, so its important that we get perception of value. Arzak was up there in our top handful of destinations we have visited. The last restaurant we visited before Azrak was Le Manoir in Oxford two stars it couldn't hold a candle to the Arzak experience the food the service were three star and beyond. Elena the Chef apart from being obviously supremely talented must be the most personable, most friendly and engaging of the three starred Chefs we have had the pleasure to meet. The food was exceptional , the ambiance sublime, and even the wine list (we like red wines and the pairing is predominantly whites) is sensibly priced and as you would expect extensive. Its easy to see why this pace has been starred since 1977 and three stars since 1989 and it still deserves every one."

Arzak,50,Arzak: A Culinary Masterpiece,"The restaurant itself is elegant and sophisticated, but it is also warm and inviting. It is the perfect place to enjoy a special occasion meal. Arzak is one of the best restaurants in the world. The food is exquisite, the service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is elegant and inviting. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a truly unforgettable dining experience."

Arzak,50,Stunning experience,Dining at Arzak was an incredible experience. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. The sommelier was great with her recommendations! I loved the quietness and privacy of our table too.

Arzak,50,Can you have more than 3 Michelin stars?,"Fabulous. Celebrated the 55th anniversary of a friendship with a truly exceptional … meal ? - no, more than just that, an experience. The food, the ambiance, the service, all unbeatable. A bit expensive, yes, but so, so worth it. I repeat: fab-u-lous."

Arzak,50,Best Meal of my Life!,"Absolutely amazing! While in San Sebastián we dined at Arzak and Akelarre. Arzak was far and away the better option. Every course was meticulously planned out offering an amazing bite with an inviting appearance.    The best part however, is that the taste was always the first priority. They would never let the “art form” get in the way of the flavors.    We would certainly go back for a special occasion. Just sorry I didn’t buy their book in our hotel to have it signed."

Arzak,50,Tasting menu,"What an amazing restaurant. The food was sublime, great service and Elena coming personally to our table was a wonderful touch. Would highly recommend."

Arzak,50,A truly memorable occasion,"Azark delivered over and above our high expectations. The food was amazing - prepared and delivered with such intricate care and attention. It was a treat to meet Elena, the owner and head chef who came out and met all of the customers. The highlight however was talking to the staff - Carmen who served us had been there for 27 yrs and Mariano, the wonderful sommelier for 44 years. The enjoyment we had from the whole experience ensured it was a wonderfully memorable occasion. Treat yourself"

Arzak,50,The Best Dining Experience of Your Life!,"This is our second visit to the fabulous Arzak in San Sebastián Spain. The world’s top female Chef Elena does not disappoint with her creative style and amazing palette. Elena is unpretentious, warm and welcoming. The presentation of the food is magical and the flavors are simply beyond. I hope you are lucky enough to get a table here. I highly recommend booking 6 months ahead. The best dining experience of your life."

Arzak,50,Sublime from start to finish,We throughly enjoyed our experience at Arzak. The staff were so friendly and made us feel welcome. The food was some of the best Michelin star food we’ve had! They catered to my husband’s allergy and my pregnancy so well - I felt in really good hands. The lovely Elena came out and had a chat with each table which was a lovely touch. It’s totally worth the price for the experience you get and the sublime food!

Arzak,50,Great night !,"Enjoyed a lovely evening with my wife to celebrate my birthday.    Each course was excellent and the service fun and friendly.    We went for the tasting menu without matching wines, and left it to the sommelier who picked a great bottle of local white and a couple glasses of red for us.    I liked the fact the courses were a bit larger than the usual small tasting plates and were a mid ground between the usual sized tasting plates and a 3 course meal.    Food wise everything was excellent, maybe not the theatre of some other 3* restaurants, but lovely all the same    Thanks to Elena and team for a great evening !!"

Arzak,50,One of the best meals of our lives in a friendly and caring environment,"Absolutely spectacular meal from start to finish, and we can highly recommend the wine pairing too. Simply worth every euro! In addition, we met the wonderful chef Elena 3 times during our 5 she was so kind and caring. We will return!"

Arzak,50,Wow!!!!,"Super experience! We got the chef's table and it's incredible! very unusual atmosphere! Delicious food, friendly staff, super sommelier and incredible chef Elena ❤️ Thanks to the whole team for a wonderful evening! Definitely recommend and we will repeat 😊"

Arzak,50,As you would expect from a high end 3 star restaurant!,"As you would expect from a 3 star restaurant the food is amazing and the ambience very nice with immaculate service. The wine pairings were, for us, a little less amazing. The earlier wines weren’t to our taste and the first was a cava which we had just ordered as our aperitif. There it could have been mentioned we would get it anyway.  We were there for our wedding anniversary and the Chef, Elena, brought us a ganache cake as a surprise (which we got to take away as we were full by that point!).  Overall, an extremely enjoyable meal at one of the best restaurants we have been to…"

Arzak,50,Amazing culinary journey!,"What can I say that hasn't been said already but this was an amazing meal! So lucky we got on the waitlist and then there was a cancellation because this was the highlight of our time in San Sebastian.    The food was amazing!!! The staff was amazing. I have never been so full in my entire life. You definitely get your money's worth and won't leave hungry.    What was really nice is the fact they are so flexible with their menu. There were a few items my wife doesn't enjoy, so they gave her off-menu options to choose from to ensure she had the best experience. That rarely happens so we were thankful it did here.    I'd go again if I could!"

Arzak,50,Great time,"Fantastic restaurant. Everything was delicious and more than worthy of its michelin rating. You can taste the passion in every bite. The chef was so gracious and down to earth she visited every single table, chatted with us and took a picture"

Arzak,50,Ultimate Basque Dining Experience,"This 3-star Michelin restaurant was exquisite on all levels . . . decor, service, personnel, and most of all dining. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that one should do if fine food is of pleasure to you."

Arzak,50,Once in a lifetime meal,"Have heard and read about this restaurant for years so when we decided to visit San Sebastian, this place was a must and I reserved months in advance.    Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and seated and we had a glass of cava while we looked at the menu choices. The concept of the tasting menu was explained to us and there were many more choices than were written down. We decided on which items to get and then the parade of dishes began. Each was described to us in detail and they were all beautiful to look at and incredible to eat. We did wines by the glass and the recommendations that were made were excellent. It's hard to pick because everything was so good. The langoustine, lamb, beef and white asparagus were especially fantastic. Chef Elena came by and introduced herself which was a real treat for us.    Service was flawless throughout the course of the 4 hours we were there. Adolfo and Mayalin in particular were simply amazing and very attentive to our needs.    Not inexpensive but worth every penny. A truly once in a lifetime meal"

Arzak,50,Amazing Arzak,"I cannot rate this restaurant highly enough, if I could I would give it 10/10! The service, the atmosphere, the food, the wine and having a chance to talk to the amazing chef Elena meant that we had an amazing experience. This place is really worth booking up if you are in the area. We had the incredible tasting menu and were blown away by the taste sensations that we experienced. Each course was explained in detail with a flourish and a smile. If you are a foodie, you must visit."

Arzak,50,Super Food Super Staff,"Súper food super staff make this an unforgettable experience.  We had the tasting menu with wine pairing and enjoyed some of the most amazing food creations ever. Elena Arzak visited each table twice during the evening and was a pleasure to chat with. We thought that the Venison was the most stunning of all but there were some many of the plates you could nominate as the best. We had truly excellent, and friendly service from Lara and Tony who deserve special mention.  A masterpiece!"

Arzak,50,"Sublime, inventive, exciting and truly Basque","Absolute class from start to finish. Often in a tasting menu at a place like this there will be one or two standout, memorable dishes, and perhaps one or two that are a bit meh… but honestly, this was the best menu I’ve ever experienced.    The langoustine will live very long in the mind, as will the monk fish, and the incredible roe deer, and the bonkers good mackerel… and even the fried garlic soup (yes, that’s a thing!). The desserts were incredible, the highlight being the corn ice cream. The petits fours were out of this world too!    The wine pairing was one of the best I’ve ever had. The rose was amazing, but the white Rioja and the main red Rioja were just top class.    Understated, confident, fun, totally basque, and (in our experience) 100% female experience! Was great to talk to Elena, and all the serving staff were fab!"

Arzak,50,A fantastic experience,One of the many reasons for visiting San Sebastián is dining at Arzak. We had a fantastic evening; a combination of great hospitality with a superb menu and great wines. Very grateful for such an experience!

Arzak,50,Best tasting menu in San Sebastián.,My first tasting menu experience and would 100% recommend. Service from start to finish was 5 star and the personal touch of meeting Chef Elena made the whole experience even better. Every course was exceptional.

Arzak,50,"What’s not to like about this restaurant? It has 3 stars for a reason, everything is exceptional.","I visited this restaurant in December 2022, whilst staying in San Sebastián. The restaurant, food and services was of the highest standard.    As one would expect the menus was explained and each course was destinies along with the wine choices.    I opted for the tasting menu with paired wine.    Everything that was put in front of me was exceptional. However I have a penchant for salt and requested some to go with the bread and olive oil. Elena came to ask if everything was okay, I was almost embarrassed to say I liked a little extra salt. Within minutes 3 different types of salt were served, brilliant!!    I also added a little extra to the marbled egg, eggs always need extra salt? This addition, in my opinion, turned an amazing dish into the most amazing dish on the menu!!!    It was then funny to hear the lady sat at the table next to me say to Elena that the food was too salty??    What do we know??    We’ll done to all involved in such a fantastic restaurant, I’ll be back with my wife the next time we’re in San Sebastián. x"

Arzak,50,Wonderful memories made in this absorbing unique gastronomic experience,"Arzak was an unforgettable experience. We went last night expecting and anticipating great food. But we were blown away at what was a life changing experience that was mind, body and soul. The atmosphere is peaceful, giving you time and space and enables you to focus on the incredible food. The staff were passionate and knowledgeable about all aspects of the food and wine. The owner came out to speak to us and was so warm and welcoming. It was my birthday and kindly I came away with a cake. We placed the trip for a long time and it was worth the wait. I cannot thank the restaurant enough for giving us these wonderful memories. Much love and thanks."

Arzak,50,Worth the trip to Spain!,My husband and I were originally scheduled in March 2020 for our 10 year wedding anniversary. Three years later we finally made it to Arzak. We have sincerely never ever had an experience like this. The delightful chef/staff demonstrated a passion for food and service that was superior. Arzak is a true experience of interacting with the story put forth by the each perfectly curated and executed dish. We wondered after three years of waiting would it live up to the hype in our minds? Indeed it exceeded our expectations and we look forward to returning some future day. Literally worth the entire trip to Spain!! Thank you Arzak for your hospitality and such a special belated anniversary 🙏

Arzak,50,Culinary Delights - Elena and team are Magic!,"What an amazing experience! The food was so good and each meal so wonderfully explained by staff. You must go if you can get a booking, it was well worth the visit. Every course so tasty and full of flavour! I will never forget it!"

Arzak,50,"It’s Arzak. If you get the chance, go :)","I doubt anyone even bothers to even read reviews about Arzak anymore - after all, it’s Arzak, but wow.  It actually is a whole experience - the taste, the smell, the presentation, everything! A highlight was speaking to Elena Arzak herself who was lovely and charming. Overall, the food in San Sebastián was top notch, and Arzak just the cherry on top."

Arzak,50,Wow. Just WOW,What an amazing experience! I love going to restaurants where they bask in the details. Just simply beautiful food packed with flavor. Found a hidden gem on their extensive wine list. Hope you can secure a reservation!

Arzak,50,Restaurant Arzak is fantastic😀,"Thanks to everybody in this fantastic restaurant! Best lunsj ever, and what a fantastic team in Arzak! Was a true pleasure and hopefully we come back again😀 Muchissimas Gracias. Highly recommended😀"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Icon of Girona and the world!,"These brothers do amazing job. Their perfect combinations of various dishes, is hust from another world! This place is like disney, you should visit once! We enjoyed every minute spent in this restaurant. Dishes are amazing. Must visit, book in advance (11month)."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Put this on your Bucket List.,"Unbelievable feel so fortunate to have secured a booking. My wife and I attended on September 20 2023 for lunch. We chose the feast menu with matching wines and the whole experience was a flawless journey of flavour, aroma and texture that unfolded morsel by morsel over a 3 1/2 hour period. There is something refreshing about putting your inhibitions aside and leaving your experience in the hands of professionals who are at the top of their game. If you have the opportunity to dine at El Cellar De Can Roca you will not be disappointed. You will read the odd review regarding the cost, in my opinion the whole experience delivered on every level and although not cheap it was certainly value for money. BTW my wife and I also stayed at the Roca Brothers Hotel Casa Cacao, it was also a wonderful experience we would recommend to anyone visiting Girona.."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Died and Gone to Food Heaven,"What can I say except there is a reason why El Celler De Can Roca and the Roca i Fontané brothers have won best restaurant Worldwide year on year and retain their coveted 3 Michelin stars with great pride, honor and much dedication and hard work.  El Cellar De Can Roca can only be described as a pilgrimage that all food lovers must try and experience.  The cuisine is central to the Catalan region and is inspired by the produce of the season.  The creativity and genius of the kitchen is outstanding and this flows through to the team at front of house.  When you entrust your passion and artwork to your team many chefs roll the dice, however not here.  The front of house team are as passionate, warm, friendly, engaging and their knowledge is breathtaking.  We feel honored to have experienced the generosity of spirit and cuisine.  Thank you to all the team at El Cellar De Can Roca and for the private tour of the kitchen after dinner."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,"Amazing food, beautiful surroundings","Sorry for my belated review, I am playing catch up. Avid user of trip advisor but need to be better with adding my own reviews as it is such a useful tool.    It is quite easy to see why this restaurant is considered one of the best in the world.    The restaurant itself is beautiful and sat in a very unassuming part of town away from all of the hustle and bustle of Girona. Due to the upmarket design, it did feel a little stuffy to us, but it really is a gorgeous place and certainly did not hinder our enjoyment of our tasting menu.    The food is beautifully presented, stunningly tasty but for me, having watched chefs table and the cigar course, I expected a bit more theatre. That being said we were served an amazing course that rained to create a jus and this was stunningly presented and tasted divine!    The wine list was huge and we opted for a flight to go with our meal and all of the wines on it were lovely, as per the norm for restaurants of this calibre, there was wine for every taste and budget and the staff were attentive and friendly and were able to explain the dishes to us in English.    A great experience and I would recommend visiting here if food is your thing!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,"Beautiful, delicious, memorable.","This is everything you'd expect from a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars. The food was beautifully presented with great professionalism and the occasional piece of theatre. The initial sequences taking you on a gastronomic history of the three chefs' was fantastic: I particularly loved the ""chicken muffin,"" which was no larger than a thumb nail but somehow managed to yield a different flavour of a roast chicken dinner every time I chewed it.    We opted for the Feast Menu with wine pairings, which the waiter described as the restaurant's ""full experience."" We lost count of the number of courses but it was more than 10, especially when you count the pre-menu courses and the petits fours. A very small glass of wine perfectly paired with each course was wonderful and meant we got to try many wines we would never normally drink. The two burgundys (a pinot noir and an almost creamy unoaked chardonnay) were standout selections.    Other courses of note were the celeriac mille feuille, the textures of tomato, the macadamia rose with the helium strawberry foam (surely all restaurants should have a helium foam trolley?) and the grilled egg plant.    I would have like to have seen a cheese course given the otherwise enormous breadth of the menu.    The petits fours trolley was something straight out of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the theme was lovely to see repeated in the sweet shop in central Girona.    Service was excellent although the waiters sometimes talked a little too quickly to catch everything. It's difficult for them as there are so many courses and timing for some of them is critical in order for the plate to arrive in the right state (foams, ice creams etc). The waiters were very knowledgeable and able to have a conversation about every single thing on the menu.    The cost is naturally high but given haute cuisine prices in major cities and the very considerable amount of investment in the restaurant and the menu, prices were within the range I had expected.    A truly memorable experience highly recommended."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,"Thank you Jordi , Josep y Joan !!!","What an incredible amazing lunch we have had here. We sat at a table from 12.45 h to almost 18.00 h and it flew by in a minute. Excellent food , well served and explained by our very professional waiter Alex. 13 appetizers followed by the Feast menu of 13 plates may seem a lot but it’s not. It’s the perfect amount , for the plates are quiet small , meant for you to tast each flavour without feeling full at any moment.  Highlight of the day was the kindness and availability of the 3 Roca brothers who took time to take a photo with us and were kind enough to show us their kitchen. Chapeau !!!"

El Celler de Can Roca,20,Disappointing,"We were so looking forward to this and overall it was very disappointing compared to Arzak and Berasategui. We chose the smaller tasting menu (as I've learnt that I can't manage a 13-course one) - 230€ for 5 dishes and 2 deserts with 85€ wine pairing (8 wines). There was complimentary house cava which I thought a nice touch. Before the menu however there were some 15 amuse bouches, meaning I was feeling fullish and overloaded before we even started on it; one of these was sole on crispy skin which was like leather which I had to remove from my mouth into a tissue (and in the absence of a plate - they were served in a series onto a 2x2x2cm granite 'post' - put in my bag for later disposal). There were a couple of stand out dishes - the celeriac, the langostine and the caramelised apricot. Unfortunately the poularde star of the show was encased in brioche which was soggy inside. Some imperfections in the space as well - thin, loose-laid carpets which looked rumpled and had the rubber underlay showing, loose and grubby soap dispenser in the men's toilet. Not a 3 star experience."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,WFD lunch,"Second visit with friends. As fantastic as the first time. We went for the feast menu with wine fight. What theatre! Food, wine & service impeccable. Visit if you ever get the opportunity."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,A dream came true.,"Service/Decor: The restaurant is beautiful—modern, clean, and simply decorated without being sterile, the decor and natural lighting makes the place warm and inviting. The service is phenomenal, no request is too large. Everyone who assisted us (too many waiters, sommeliers, and other staff to name) were both professional and friendly. The entire service lasted four and a half hours, but was orchestrated magically. Plates and glasses were cleared without distraction, and courses were well explained. We were given a tour of the kitchen after asking, and Joan and Jordi both posed for pictures and signed our books we had purchased.    Food and Beverage: The feast menu is about 13 courses, but also includes about 15 appetizers. It sounds like a ton of food, but you are not rushed at all. Take your time, savor every bite and enjoy the moment. I had gastric surgery and was very worried about not being able to make it through, but I finished the meal along with a wine pairing. You may not love every dish, but this is not just food, this is art. Art may sometimes bother or challenge your perceptions, but take it as part of the experience. I was the only one at the table who chose the wine pairing, which was expertly presented with wines from across Europe. Every wine was delicious, and the pairing was explained well. I shared my pairing with my aunt, as I do not drink too much, but wanted to fully experience the offerings of all three brothers.    Overall, this is truly a once in a lifetime experience. Do not be intimated by the restaurant’s prestige, the experience is fun, challenging, delicious, and magical."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Phenomenal,Exceptional experience that is highly recommended. Andrea provided outstanding service. The presentation of the 20+ courses was immaculate. Everything was well-orchestrated and delivered. Phenomenal!

El Celler de Can Roca,50,"Without a doubt, the most amazing gastronomic experience of our lives!","My wife and I decided to travel across the Atlantic to dine here after being intrigued by the Chef's Table episode featuring Jordi Roca and the uber-talented Roca brothers who have made this restaurant into an amazing bucket list worthy experience.    As a frugal individual who does not typically spend my hard earned dollars frivolously, this splurge was absolutely worth every penny and then some. We thought this would be a once in a lifetime thing, but after what we experienced, we honestly hope to have the opportunity to come back here again sometime in the future. I would recommend it to anyone.    Our waiter, Pablo, and our sommelier, Cyril, were absolutely outstanding! I can't thank them both enough for making this an amazing experience. Their presentation and knowledge of the dishes and wines being served were exceptional. Thank you to both of of you for making this a most memorable experience.    If you want to experience a meal of a lifetime with impeccable service, please do yourself a favour and visit this restaurant; it is outstanding!!"

El Celler de Can Roca,40,One too many dishes,"Everything was great but the number of the dish were just too much. We chose 13 feasting menu. What started as great slowly turned to feeling very full and could not even finish couples of last dishes. We just wonder the necessity of having that many dishes. I think the dish could finish much earlier ie. around 8 dishes. It's more than enough in satifsying our palates and fulfilling our appetite. Afterwards, the dishes felt like a redundant. The venue, atmosphere and service was great. It is expensive but with the many dishes, it's quite a value for money"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,10/10 as expected,"Booked the restaurant 11 months before our forthcoming wedding anniversary and we weren’t disappointed    Ordered the 15 course feast menu, with 10-12 amuses and accompanying wines    Service was fun and informative    We enjoyed every course over the 4 hours of foodie entertainment    Defo one of our top 4 meals we’ve experienced and worthy of its 3* rating"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Amazing experience,"Absolutely exquisite experience! From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out everything was perfect! I have never been served as I was there, but the food....I've had better."

El Celler de Can Roca,20,"Venue, service, presentation impeccable; Food disappointing","As a disciple of gastronomy, i found myself last Saturday in Girona, a delightful cobblestoned medieval town a couple of hours north of Barcelona, the site of celebrated 3 Michelin El Celler de Can Roca, the brainchild of the famed Brothers Roca.    I found later that Girona, dating back to pre-Roman empire times, is not only a cycling Mecca, the favorite training base of multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, but also the backdrop for many scenes of the popular TV series Game of Thrones. Picturesque and dramatic it certainly is.    A few years earlier, i had been fortunate enough to have persuaded the chef at 2 Michelin star Dani Maison on the island of Ischia, near Napoles, to open the restaurant for lunch specially for my party of 8, since all dinner reservations had been spoken for many months ago, for the entire week i had been scheduled to be in the area, with none of the cancellations we had been hoping for.    After we explained the situation and begged (piteously!) several times, the chef had been gracious enough to round up his crew and accommodate us. It was simply the best meal of my life, especially memorable since i make it a point to experience as many Michelin restaurants as i can during my travels.    We had been sailing the Amalfi Coast, a week of Michelin delight, stopping in at the various coastal towns and villages: to name a few, Capri, Positano, Sorrento and other equally impossibly beautiful and romantic medieval towns, setting our sailing schedule to match the reservations we had been able to procure.    A 3 Michelin meal is supposedly particularly worth making a special trip for. So, it was with great hope and anticipation that we made a transcontinental trip to Barcelona, and then a couple hours north, deep into the separatist province of Catalunya, on the Iberian peninsula, for El Celler de Can Roca.    My niece Gayatri had somehow managed a snag a reservation for 715pm for this date, due to a cancellation some months prior. So my travel plans were built around this reservation.    The entrance to the restaurant is dramatic, as the backlit ivy-covered passage walls suddenly open onto a large outdoor seating courtyard visible from the angled floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Since it is winter, and temperatures are quite cold, there were no patrons outdoors, but it must be quite pleasant in warmer times.    As we entered the restaurant, we found one of the well-coiffed brothers Roca industriously signing the flyleaf of a pile of books on the counter. It appears there is a whole section of coffee table books devoted to recipes and descriptions of the meal we were about to experience. Our salivary glands quivered!    While expensive (prix fixe 270 €) that’s not excessive for 12 courses following 16 appetizers. I had skipped lunch, in anticipation! But it is definitively caloric overkill, while visually and creatively impressive.    We were informed by the proud waiter that no fewer than 400 fresh organic local ingredients had been used to prepare a specially curated vegetarian meal.    The venue, service, technical expertise and presentation were impeccable, but i found the taste itself bland, insipid, unidimensional and uninspired, with many sauces and textures indistinguishable from each other, a real letdown and disappointment. Oh, well!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,An experience of a lifetime,"We started our journey running into Jordi Roca in the car park. I wasn’t sure what omen this was meant to be. We arrived with big expectations.    We were greeted and seamlessly seated. They were staff gliding about everywhere, all knowing where to be an what to do.    We choose the feast menu, for an additional €40 it seemed silly not to try the entire menu rather than the shorter menu.    I had the pairing wines. I was greeted by Josep Roca.    We started with appetizers which were not on the menu and they seemed to keep coming. All of these were magnifícant.    The menu and the wine paring commented. Over 4 hours we experienced magic. I cannot describe what I ate or experienced. It exceeded all of my expectations.    I said it would be a once in a lifetime experience but that will not be, I’m going back!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Exeptional,From the beginning till the end was one surprise after another. Service and food was topnoch.Top 3 foodexperiences of my life.Many thanks to the team of can roca.

El Celler de Can Roca,50,One of the best restaurants in the world,"#3 of 410 Restaurants in Girona? Seriously?!! We were fortunate to be in several Michelin 3 stars restaurants. IMHO El Celler de Can Roca is one of the best in the world. Actually, it was voted the world’s best restaurant in 2013 and 2015. I don't have enough words to describe how much we enjoyed the food, wines, service, and atmosphere. Attached images will give you only an idea of the visual beauty and our menu. Try to make your reservation many (11!!) months in advance."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Lived up to the hype at a relatively reasonable cost,"We were lucky enough to snag reservations off the waiting list and went for our anniversary trip to Spain. It was a four and a half hour dinner, but a lovely experience. The food was terrific (with a few misses for my tastes) but when they soared, it was incredible (the langoustine in vanilla butter, the celeraic dish, the chicken and truffle in brioche and the purpleology berry dessert come to mind). A couple of tips:    PACE YOURSELF. We got the feast and with all the extra appetizers they brought, it was about 25+ courses. I could only eat one bite of several and I regretted eating all the appetizers when I couldn't eat my favorite mains. I somehow rallied for dessert...    Have fun. They have a playful aspect to some of the dishes...especially the ""It always rains in the pine forest"" It was an experience.    It is a once in a lifetime experience, so go for the feast. Some of those dishes were some of the best bites I had (and it wasn't my first MIchelin three star)    We didn't do the wine pairing because I am just not that big a drinker. We had a lovely bottle of wine which was fine for us. Because of that our bill was under 600 euros so very reasonable for the experience. But, if you are a big drinker, then probably go for it.    Enjoy. I don't think you will regret the experience!"

El Celler de Can Roca,40,An experience to remember,"Dining at a restaurant that has been regarded for multiple years as the best in the world is always a nice experience. The expectations will be sky high, hence why giving a 5 star to such places is rare from me, cause on many occasions, you expect something more.    Having been wanting to visit this place for many years, finally managed to get a booking. Unfortunately covd struck and my booking has been moved 3 times over two years. But finally the day came.    Can Roca is a journey, don't worry food will be enough. The place and decor are not what you visit for here, in fact very simple and set in a residential area around 20 minutes walk from central Girona, in fact we walked through the peaceful streets of Girona.    Some plates were amazing, others good, others expected better. Among the best for me were the Saint George mushroom brioche, the suckling lamb stew and the ball pool.    Wine pairing was ok, expected something better, I am a wine graduate myself and I have years of experience when it comes to wine, being also my job.    A magical show to remember is the rain forest dish......it's a beautiful show    On the negative side, after we confirmed that we are going to the wine degustation, few minutes later we were asked by another waiter if we would like any wine. Another note that toilet towel bin was full with towels dropping on the floor. At this level I expect more attention to these little details.    All in all it's a nice experience that will remember for the years to come. Price came to €400 per person, but to reach these level it takes lot of hard work, dedication, long nights, stress and dark moments, so well done to the Roca brothers and all those involved."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Excellent experience,"From the moment you walk in the experience begins. Graciously greeted and escorted to your table, the service is without flaw and everything is expertly attended to.  After attending some of the best restaurants in Ny and Paris I will have to say that El Celler de Can Roca surpasses them all. Exceptional food is an understatement, Wine tasting was phenomenal and the experience was unforgettable!  I look forward to returning soon."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"An amazing experience of beautiful and sometimes challenging food. If its not delicious, (which it usually was) it was interesting. The staff were amazing and the atmosphere surprisingly relaxed with a distinct lack of pretension."

El Celler de Can Roca,40,"Great restaurant, but overcomplicated","By almost any measure, I would give this restaurant 5 out of 5. The ambience, the service, the playfulness and the creativity. We were lucky to get a lunch spot at very short notice since we were on the waiting list and we had a fantastic experience. We selected the 15-course (!) Feast Menu and it was a parade of exotic dishes. However at the end of the day it is the flavors that count and here have been to other Michelin restaurants that perform better. It is not the number of ingredients that count, it is how they interact with each other and what sensations they create."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Lost for words so good was the food ❤️,Our lunch experience was of excellent food and service. Really great food. Lovely wineparrings. We are so happy to have tried it and hope we Will be avle to get a table again.

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Chose Spain as our honeymoon destination just for this restaurant!,"That's right folks! Waited until midnight Spanish time 11 months in advance to get reservations for El Celler and we still fell short. Thankfully we waitlisted and were able to get reservations 11 months in advance! Fast forward to May 2022 and our experience eating here was well worth the wait. We do not regret choosing Spain for our honeymoon all thanks to the Roca brothers!    Needless to say we were so excited to eat here. Everything was blow-your-mind perfect! Everything about this restaurant has been well thought out, every detail from the placement of the tables to how the guests are facing. This restaurant is refined without being pretentious and the food had me seeing shapes! That's how magical it was. My husband and I were transported to another planet with each bite!    Shout out to to Cyril our sommelier for educating us on the various wine and wine glasses! We chose to do the feast with wine pairing - FYI be prepared to become more than slightly intoxicated due to a wine tasting with each bite!!!    Thank you El Celler de Can Roca and the Roca Brothers for making this restaurant everything it is! We enjoyed it and plan to return in this lifetime!!!    IF YOU CAN - MAKE THE TREK AND EAT HERE. LIFE CHANGING AND LIFE GIVING!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,"WOW, just wow",Yes it was well worth the one year ahead reservation process. IT was an amazing feast dinner with wine pairing. It was a night to remember for our whole group. excellent all around

El Celler de Can Roca,50,One of the very best!,"Family lunch, full tasting menu. Third visit, again fabulous, worthy of all its many accolades. Minimum three hours. Innovative but not over the top, with the ultimate wine list to play with. Tough to get a table though…"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Outstanding on all fronts,"An outstanding bucket list experience.  You should go to this restaurant before you die!  The range and depth of flavours were matched by the fabulous selection of wines.  The setting was unexpectedly modern, pleasing and relaxing.  The service was superb and each dish was explained patiently to us in detail in English"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Best restaurant in the world!,"We've been to many Michelin *** restaurants. All, with a few exceptions, (like Le Louis XV) are great.  El Celler was the greatest!  ALL dishes were perfect, tasty, beautifully presented and very creative!  Don't waste your time going to anywhere else. Go for it!  Best, Best, Best!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,An experience never to be forgotten,"We managed to get a cancellation but due to our flight times had to push them back on the time so it was quite a stressful build up but the staff were fantastic about it. The service, food and wine pairings were, as you’d expect, amazing. The Feast is a significant meal… next time we’d go for the smaller menu as we struggled with 20+ courses (there were 5+ appetisers).    The restaurant feels very high class and it was worth every penny.    If I was looking to find fault I’d say it would be nice to have something with crunch or more texture mid-courses but it would be ridiculous to reduce the score for a personal preference when you’re basically eating art!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Phenomenal!,"Phenomenal. Not much to add to 3,000+ 5 star reviews… this place lives up to the hype! All the staff are excellent, particularly our waiter Uri."

El Celler de Can Roca,50,WOW - OVERWHLMING,"The restaurant El Celler de Can Roca - what can we say? A dream comes true! Thank you for this overwhelming adventure. This time in the restaurant was something we won't forget, a journey in different universes, passion, love, perfection, inspiration. All the dishes we tasted were extraordinary, and like we told Jordi, in your restaurant we tasted the best dessert we had tasted till now! Bravo to all of you!! You deserve the love and appreciation you get from people all over the world.  We were 5 hours in the restaurant and we could stay more and more...you are AMAZING!  ¡Muchísimas gracias amigos!  Sharon and Gali"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,Exceeded our Expectations!,"Overall Great Experience and the highlight of our trip. Loved the atmosphere, food, presentation and wine pairings. So much information on each dish & wine and loved trying out Jordi's new dessert. We met two of the brothers on our visit and witnessed a marriage proposal. A truely magical experience!!"

El Celler de Can Roca,50,The best …,"The greatest gastronomical experience I have had - a bucket list banker which exceeded our expectations in restaurant ambience and design, service, creativity, flavour combinations, food presentation, and matching with wines."

Cenador de Amós,50,Our FAV in Spain! Not to miss!!,"Top notch experience! Compared to other Michelin culinary experiences here in Spain, this is our number one! The food is approachable yet very unique and delicious! They showcase local ingredients. We will be dreaming about the whiskey sour back at home! The entire journey was fabulous. The staff was genuine and not stuffy. One of our waitresses, Genesis, gets a special shout out for being so enthusiastic and knowledgeable!"

Cenador de Amós,50,Must go!,Must go !  Menu was beyond expectations! It's nothing you've had before. Traditional Spanish food with modern culinary techniques! From the cocktails to the menu. Tried the strawberry vermouth and the whiskey sour made with flowers.  Appetizers and desserts were by far our fav part of the whole experience!  Bread is baked in place

Cenador de Amós,50,Incredible. Beautiful. Bliss,"There are no words to describe how amazing the experience of eating here is  Exquisite, seems lame.  The entire experience brings joy.  Do the tasting menu with paired drinks, you won’t be disappointed  We went as a celebration but for any experience this would be Devine.  Sounds slushy. It isn’t"

Cenador de Amós,50,Too good for mere words,It is hard to find words to describe how wonderful this restaurant is    You need deep pockets but if you can you should not die without eating here    The tasting menu and wine pairing are exquisite    The staff and service unimpeachable    My partner and I have just got married and this was our own wedding ‘breakfast’    It was the best meal either of us have ever had    To the staff - thank you    We are the people in the yellow car

Cenador de Amós,50,Not enough room in TA setting to do justice to this great restaurant,"Inspiring, well executed food with plenty of local references. Nice setting and great, congenial service. What else can you ask for/"

Cenador de Amós,50,A perfect pleasure.,"Upon arrival it became clear that the Covid measures are scrupulously carried out as the times demand.  We took the long menu and Jesús Sanchez led us with a ""in crescendo"" thread to the end.  Starting with his appetizers and the pintxos reinterpreted modernizing the classics.  His cocido and a series of dishes with the master's brushstrokes that gently lead you to his work with the bonito, the grouper, the carrot game and his spectacular pigeon.  His dishes are beautiful while he manages to bring out the intense flavour of the products.  The desserts, very suitable after such a banquet, one less sweet and the other to choose between a chocolate enjoyment or a last deconstruction, and the petit fours arrive a last wink to the menu closes it with elegance.  The environment and the staff complete the experience."

Cenador de Amós,50,Outstanding,"This is outstanding.  From the very first welcome in the garden to the finish with sweet and coffee on the terrasse everything was amazing.  We - of course - loves the food. Traditional and a lot of fantasy. Surprising. Telling stories. Smells and tasting.  The service is very professional, but in the relaxed way. We vere feeling very comfortable. Nice.  We hope to be back.  We have tried other tre star restaurants. Cenador de Amos is absolutely worth the all the recommendations we can give."

Cenador de Amós,40,Superb place. I had not been,Superb place. I had not been in a few years - they have since gained another star by Michelin to make it a 2 star. I was truly surprised and delighted by the creativity and improvements across the board- from the dining space which has been massively upgraded and renovated to the food itself which was truly a delight. The chef was charming when he visited the tables and truly warm. The Sommalier gave us superb recommendations that do not break the bank. A must do on a culinary drive across north Spain for sure. I will not wait as long to be back!

Cenador de Amós,50,Stupendous,"Very high quality, luxurious, outstanding. Fully deserves its two Michelin stars. No regrets here.    All the food is excellent : very refined and light, tasty, varied. With exceptionally good dishes such as : Consommé of Morcilla tapa; main course of Pigeon stuffed with leak & mushroom, on a mixed vegetable base, in a rich sauce, with mustard, broccoli trunk & soufflé potatoes; and a pre-dessert of citric Passion Fruit and Yogurt Ice-cream stuffed with Mango and Apple.  Only small complaints, the exploding mustard balls with the pigeon, and the slightly heavy Raviole starter.    All the glasses of wines proposed with the menu are very good.    High calibre service, plentiful staff, and warm welcome. Although the head waiter can come over as a bit as tense and cold. For example, not offering an aperitif upon arrival.    Before arriving at your table, one is offered an original tour of the manor, including through the wine cellar and its own bakery, with a visit to two different salons for aperitifs.    Relaxing atmosphere, in a very nice, interesting building, leaving an impression of tradition with a modern touch. Well spaced tables, and well frequented that lunch-time. Although the air-conditioning is rather too cool.    Well worth the higher price compared with the 1-star Michelin restaurants in the area."

Cenador de Amós,50,lovely experience,"I went there with my parents last summer, exceptional food, the best restaurant I've ever been, will go back next summer!"

Cenador de Amós,30,50-50 pro and contro,"We need an English commentary here as Google translations are incomprehensible.  FOR:  This restaurant deserves its Michelin stars: the cuisine is excellent.  The staff are attentive.  The place is impressive,the building historic.  If you are a gourmet, or a professional food expert/writer, you will probably enjoy this experience.  AGAINST:  The cuisine is complex. Nothing is simple. Dishes are served in small elegant portions - don't come here if you are hungry, or suffer from a healthy appetite!  Be prepared for a large bill: elegance has its price.  The staff is very attentive and polite but service is slow: over two hours for lunch may be enjoyed by some, but for older people it can be an ordeal. Service is choreographed: I find it over the top and would prefer a more down-to-earth approach. If I want choreography I go to the ballet.  The building is in an out-of-the-way village which is badly signposted. We drove for miles - be sure to have an efficient sat nav.  The very historic building needs better lighting at the entrance: ancient stone slabs and unlit steps may be authentic but are dangerous."

Cenador de Amós,50,Exemplary - 16 courses!,"Came for lunch at 13:30.  Lovely welcome by multilingual staff.  3 menus to choose from: 3 course a la carte, 9 and 13 course tasting menu for € 55, €75, €105 respectively.  We chose the latter. It was a 3 hour experience.  In retrospect we should have chosen the smaller tasting menu as the one we had was rather too much!  Ask for the main dining room and not the side room as it's brighter and more interesting.  Great place, fab staff and great food. What more could you want...."

Cenador de Amós,50,Almost perfect restaurante,"Very good taste food,excellent service style and inside,good wine and other drink,with very reasonable price. Wonderful restaurante and it should be very difficult to find like Amos(food,drink,atmosphere,service,price,chef...). Should to try to go if you would travel between Oviedo and Bilbao."

Cenador de Amós,50,One of the Best in Cantabria,This has to be one of the top restaurants in Cantabria. Taking the best ingredients of the region to create a menu that is a mix of both elaborate and simple dishes yet always perfectly executed. The service is impeccable from the moment you enter the door. An all round faultless experience. Highly recommended.

Cenador de Amós,50,One of kind lunch,"In a village just off the main roads one can find the beautiful Centador de Amos. There is the event location on the far end of the property that I can only imagine to be a dream wedding location. There is plenty of parking space and there are hosts waiting to welcome you into the venue. It makes you feel right at home and it is immediately clear that this will be a treat. As we did not speak Spanish they made sure there was always someone who spoke english to ensure we could comfortably ask any question and were offered an English menu.    We started with a choice of one of the set menus outside in the lounge where we chose the middle menu “Esencia” (75E IVA included). We were taken to a bigger room inside where a few other tables were already enjoying their lunch. The tables were well spaced for enough privacy and every guest seemed to feel just as much of a special guest. The servers made their best effort to make some small talk, but were mostly very unobtrustive and were right there anytime you would like something or even right before. The timing was great for every dish and the teamwork was astonishing.    The food was amazing, especially the amuses and appetizers were out of this world. The “Caramelized Foie”, “Coastal Tuna” were among my personal highlights as well as the regional favourite of Sardines only this time in a modern setting. All the dishes were quite a large portion so don’t worry about going home hungry.. Also because of the bread that was supplied which also tasted amazing. I won’t give away too much on the contents as the tastes were quite surprising but never unpleasant. After the dinner we were seated in the sun in the lounge again and enjoyed some great complimentary petits fours with our espresso.    Certainly recommended. At least at the higher-end of the one star spectrum well worth the time to travel here and the money."

Cenador de Amós,50,Spanish Cooking at its best,"We booked this restaurant for lunch on a Thursday during our holiday to Cantabria. The restaurant was empty apart from us but it didn't feel like it. The staff were great with our dreadful Spanish and complete lack of understanding of Spanish cuisine. The place has a lovely balance of old and new.    So, the food. For starters my daughter (11) and I both had the cod salad which was basically raw cod, which had been 'cooked' in lemon juice. The eleven year old wolfed it down declaring it 'wonderful'. My if had a cocido or bean stew which had the most int nose flavour either of us had come across. For mains, my daughter had a poached hake dish which was perfectly cooked. My wife went for chicken with black rice, while I ordered what I had expected to be a beef stew of some kind, but turned out to be tripe and possibly lungs; it was gorgeous. The only reason all plates were not wiped clean was that the portions were very generous. For dessert we had a meille feuille, and two apple tarts.    The Wien list, as you would expect is extensive, but priced remarkably fairly. Strong representation from most Spanish regions including Mallorca which was a surprise as we haven't seen their wines outside the island before. We went for hefty red from Toro, which I had been dying to try for ages. Prices are very reasonable as seems to be the case throughout Cantabria.    All in all a fabulous meal in lively surroundings. The dishes were traditional regional fare but given a twist or made special. This is a fantastic restaurant and we would like to thank the staff who took the time to explain things to us. Next time I'll pay more attention when they say 'tripe'. It wasn't a dish I would have chosen, but I'm very glad I had it because it was truly delicious."

Cenador de Amós,50,Dinner on holiday,"""From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave this is one big enjoyable experience. I have eaten tasting menus before but the 'Experiencia' was unbelievable. Well thought out, well explained and just amazing to eat. Such a variation of tastes and quality presentation. Oh, and you will be comfortably full! The wine list is a wine lovers delight. We settled for one of the many Gran Reserva Riojas and was not disappointed. The mark ups are minimal too! The waiters were excellent. Very efficient and unobtrusive. They also spoke excellent English. Don't be afraid of taking children with you. They accommodated by producing a dish of less rich and daunting food that our 12 year old loved!!!, however, to her delight, the selection of children's pudding was from the a la carte menu and didn't disappoint. The atmosphere in some Michelin starred restaurants can be a little pretentious. Not here. You must give this well run establishment a try.""."

Cenador de Amós,50,Great Place,"We had a family gathering, we had a big table. The food was excelent, the wine selection is wide and great and the service was discreet and impecable. A great place. The decoration is very smart."

Cenador de Amós,50,Superb dining in a wonderful location with an amazingly talented chef!,"From the moment we stepped through the door the welcome was amazing. The restaurant was full - Saturday night and Mother's Day weekend. We didn't have to worry about our poor Spanish as not only had the whole menu had been translated it also made perfect sense! The four of us chose the middle price tasting menu at €60. Individual changes are allowed if there are dislikes. A selection of appetisers came in succession, followed by a superbly fresh fish course, melt in the mouth oxtail as the main course, desert and a planchette of petit fours. The service was faultless - neither rushed nor slow. They have an incredible wine selection and we accepted their recommendation and had a terrific Rioja which was also sensibly priced. Absolutely faultless cooking, each mouthful was a joy to experience. Jesus Sanchez is a chef who shows great skill using local ingredients to ensure that all his dishes work well together. A truly memorable dinner - absolute perfection."

Cenador de Amós,50,Underrated one-star wonder,Food here has strong local roots and takes advantage of seasonal offerings.

Cenador de Amós,50,top quality dining,"We heard about this restaurant through other guests in our hotel, and as it had a michelin star, thought we'd try it out. What a fantastic evening. We had the cheapest menu, which still consisted of 6 courses. All the food was beautifully presented, ""Masterchef"" style, and the dishes were innovative and elegant, but using local produce. The staff were so attentive, but not in your face, and the way the restaurant is laid out, you don't feel over-looked or heard by other diners. It was a real highlight to our holiday, especially as it's so off the beaten track."

Cenador de Amós,50,Fabulous,"What a fantastic experience. The food was excellent, innovative and beautifully presented. They used local seasonal produce and made it all taste exquisite. The staff could't have been more helpful, especially as our Spanish was not that good, even bringing over to the table an English chef from the kitchen - who incidentally told us what a pleasure it was to work in the kitchens there. The service was attentive without being too much in your face. The atmosphere was calm, professional and friendly, with high quality table linens.    We would have gone again, but unfortunately they were fully booked for the one day we could have gone. I highly recommend this restaurant. Go if you are in the area."

Arzak,50,Perfection,"Best eating experience of my life, true food art, and theatre combined. Just the correct balance of spectacular food, wine, and easy welcoming table service. Perfection."

Arzak,50,Stunning experience,Dining at Arzak was an incredible experience. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. The sommelier was great with her recommendations! I loved the quietness and privacy of our table too.

Arzak,50,Can you have more than 3 Michelin stars?,"Fabulous. Celebrated the 55th anniversary of a friendship with a truly exceptional … meal ? - no, more than just that, an experience. The food, the ambiance, the service, all unbeatable. A bit expensive, yes, but so, so worth it. I repeat: fab-u-lous."

Arzak,50,Tasting menu,"What an amazing restaurant. The food was sublime, great service and Elena coming personally to our table was a wonderful touch. Would highly recommend."

Arzak,50,One of the best meals of our lives in a friendly and caring environment,"Absolutely spectacular meal from start to finish, and we can highly recommend the wine pairing too. Simply worth every euro! In addition, we met the wonderful chef Elena 3 times during our 5 she was so kind and caring. We will return!"

Arzak,50,Wow!!!!,"Super experience! We got the chef's table and it's incredible! very unusual atmosphere! Delicious food, friendly staff, super sommelier and incredible chef Elena ❤️ Thanks to the whole team for a wonderful evening! Definitely recommend and we will repeat 😊"

Arzak,50,As you would expect from a high end 3 star restaurant!,"As you would expect from a 3 star restaurant the food is amazing and the ambience very nice with immaculate service. The wine pairings were, for us, a little less amazing. The earlier wines weren’t to our taste and the first was a cava which we had just ordered as our aperitif. There it could have been mentioned we would get it anyway.  We were there for our wedding anniversary and the Chef, Elena, brought us a ganache cake as a surprise (which we got to take away as we were full by that point!).  Overall, an extremely enjoyable meal at one of the best restaurants we have been to…"

Arzak,50,Amazing culinary journey!,"What can I say that hasn't been said already but this was an amazing meal! So lucky we got on the waitlist and then there was a cancellation because this was the highlight of our time in San Sebastian.    The food was amazing!!! The staff was amazing. I have never been so full in my entire life. You definitely get your money's worth and won't leave hungry.    What was really nice is the fact they are so flexible with their menu. There were a few items my wife doesn't enjoy, so they gave her off-menu options to choose from to ensure she had the best experience. That rarely happens so we were thankful it did here.    I'd go again if I could!"

Arzak,50,Great time,"Fantastic restaurant. Everything was delicious and more than worthy of its michelin rating. You can taste the passion in every bite. The chef was so gracious and down to earth she visited every single table, chatted with us and took a picture"

Arzak,50,Ultimate Basque Dining Experience,"This 3-star Michelin restaurant was exquisite on all levels . . . decor, service, personnel, and most of all dining. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that one should do if fine food is of pleasure to you."

Arzak,50,Once in a lifetime meal,"Have heard and read about this restaurant for years so when we decided to visit San Sebastian, this place was a must and I reserved months in advance.    Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and seated and we had a glass of cava while we looked at the menu choices. The concept of the tasting menu was explained to us and there were many more choices than were written down. We decided on which items to get and then the parade of dishes began. Each was described to us in detail and they were all beautiful to look at and incredible to eat. We did wines by the glass and the recommendations that were made were excellent. It's hard to pick because everything was so good. The langoustine, lamb, beef and white asparagus were especially fantastic. Chef Elena came by and introduced herself which was a real treat for us.    Service was flawless throughout the course of the 4 hours we were there. Adolfo and Mayalin in particular were simply amazing and very attentive to our needs.    Not inexpensive but worth every penny. A truly once in a lifetime meal"

Arzak,50,Amazing Arzak,"I cannot rate this restaurant highly enough, if I could I would give it 10/10! The service, the atmosphere, the food, the wine and having a chance to talk to the amazing chef Elena meant that we had an amazing experience. This place is really worth booking up if you are in the area. We had the incredible tasting menu and were blown away by the taste sensations that we experienced. Each course was explained in detail with a flourish and a smile. If you are a foodie, you must visit."

Arzak,50,Super Food Super Staff,"Súper food super staff make this an unforgettable experience.  We had the tasting menu with wine pairing and enjoyed some of the most amazing food creations ever. Elena Arzak visited each table twice during the evening and was a pleasure to chat with. We thought that the Venison was the most stunning of all but there were some many of the plates you could nominate as the best. We had truly excellent, and friendly service from Lara and Tony who deserve special mention.  A masterpiece!"

Arzak,50,"Sublime, inventive, exciting and truly Basque","Absolute class from start to finish. Often in a tasting menu at a place like this there will be one or two standout, memorable dishes, and perhaps one or two that are a bit meh… but honestly, this was the best menu I’ve ever experienced.    The langoustine will live very long in the mind, as will the monk fish, and the incredible roe deer, and the bonkers good mackerel… and even the fried garlic soup (yes, that’s a thing!). The desserts were incredible, the highlight being the corn ice cream. The petits fours were out of this world too!    The wine pairing was one of the best I’ve ever had. The rose was amazing, but the white Rioja and the main red Rioja were just top class.    Understated, confident, fun, totally basque, and (in our experience) 100% female experience! Was great to talk to Elena, and all the serving staff were fab!"

Arzak,50,A fantastic experience,One of the many reasons for visiting San Sebastián is dining at Arzak. We had a fantastic evening; a combination of great hospitality with a superb menu and great wines. Very grateful for such an experience!

Arzak,50,Best tasting menu in San Sebastián.,My first tasting menu experience and would 100% recommend. Service from start to finish was 5 star and the personal touch of meeting Chef Elena made the whole experience even better. Every course was exceptional.

Arzak,50,"What’s not to like about this restaurant? It has 3 stars for a reason, everything is exceptional.","I visited this restaurant in December 2022, whilst staying in San Sebastián. The restaurant, food and services was of the highest standard.    As one would expect the menus was explained and each course was destinies along with the wine choices.    I opted for the tasting menu with paired wine.    Everything that was put in front of me was exceptional. However I have a penchant for salt and requested some to go with the bread and olive oil. Elena came to ask if everything was okay, I was almost embarrassed to say I liked a little extra salt. Within minutes 3 different types of salt were served, brilliant!!    I also added a little extra to the marbled egg, eggs always need extra salt? This addition, in my opinion, turned an amazing dish into the most amazing dish on the menu!!!    It was then funny to hear the lady sat at the table next to me say to Elena that the food was too salty??    What do we know??    We’ll done to all involved in such a fantastic restaurant, I’ll be back with my wife the next time we’re in San Sebastián. x"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,10,This restaurant does not deserve to be a Michelin 3-star one,"We dined at the restaurant and we had been many Michelin starred restaurant all around the world.    We decided to try Joel Robuchon HK and had the worst experience not only as a Michelin starred one, but just overall.    Food - it was really just okay! Ramsey in London; French Laundry, Single Thread in US; Caprice, Bo innovation in HK, ABaC in Barcelona and many many more are far above JB.    We had the tasting menu and ordered a white truffle pasta to share. For dishes on tasting menu was nothing speculator, I had had better one. When we tasted the pasta, initially we felt there wasn’t much truffle taste as they claimed 10g of fresh truffle. All we could taste was cheese, we provided feedback to the server, pretty much was told truffle was cooked into the pasta, but honestly we could not even nose any truffle in the dish. Later on, another server came and said 1g of truffle was cooked into the sauce and 9g was on the pasta, we told him we didn’t taste any and we didn’t see any truffle on top and that, they should shave the truffle when dish was served. He then subsequently said they forgot to shave the truffle on top, is this a joke for a dish that cost close to US$200. This mistake should never have been made in any restaurant. We felt we were cheated as they think they can take advantage for someone they think were visitors. The server initially tried to argue with us and until the end, they forgot the truffle. At the end, he offered to shave fresh truffle on our last beef dish instead. We were so pissed as we felt we didn’t think they treat their customers properly and thought that we were just “stupid” that we didn’t know what food is. We told him we did not want to see him any longer. At the end, they took the dish off the final bill, but there is enough humiliation. Party of 4 with wine at US$500 a head left with feeling being insulted. This is Joel Robuchon Hong Kong!    Service - again, noting special enough to mention. We were at Bo Innovation couple night ago, service there is top notch even they were 80% to capacity. Night before at Nicholini service was friendly.    For anyone reading this, don’t waste your money in this restaurant. Go to Caprice at Four Season or 8½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA in the same complex at Landmark will give you a much more pleasant experience and you will be treated properly."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Proper three star,"L'Atelier Robuchon in the Landmark Building in Hong Kong has held 3 stars for a number of years, and I think deservedly so... My daughter and I ate à la carte, and my daughter's lobster spaghetti with caviar and her ""Oeuf caviar"" were both very good; so was my langoustine en papillotte and my sweetbread main - the latter of very good quality. My wife and her friend had the lunch menu with each an add-on, lamb for my wife and lobster for her friend. Both were very happy. The bread basket is superb, the comté rolls standing out. We had a bottle of 2012 Kongsgaard Chardonnay, which was , as you would imagine, very good. Service was virtually flawless, something that cannot currently be taken for granted in Hong Kong, even in high end estabishments...."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Excellent meal but ….,As usual this is where we love to have lunch as it’s definitely less expensive than dinner. 🤪 Food is definitely great and service impeccable. Prices has gone up more than double three years ago. However it’s still great food

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Dining at Robuchon has been the most wonderful one.,Dining at Robuchon has been the most wonderful one. Fresh food with fabulous presentation. We enjoyed the food very much and were truly grateful for the fantastic arrangement for birthday celebration. A big thank you to the staffs for making my birthday distinctive and memorable.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,When you don’t want a meal to end,"It is many years since I last visited, for a restaurant to maintain its standard is a challenge, to exceed is exceptional. Thoroughly enjoyable."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Very good lunch,"I’d lunch at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon with a friend.    Yellow tail carpaccio with citrus dressing and Espelette pepper, one of the new dishes on the menu, was beautifully presented and tasted refreshingly delicious. Other dishes were very good too.    However, the signature mashed potato wasn’t hot enough. And the wait time between courses was a little too long. Maybe it’s because the restaurant is now back to its full seating capacity.    The service was commendable. I’d like to mention Sophie in particular. She always takes very good care of me. Her professionalism and attention to details are exceptional."

Lobster Soup  呢個可能係我飲過最好飲既龍蝦湯🦞，超級濃郁既龍蝦鮮味。另外，配上一口龍蝦，龍蝦非常彈牙爽口。勁想叫多碗飲🤭    2. Free-ranged Quail and Foie Gras, Served with Mashed Potato  鵪鶉脾超級滑，油脂分布啱啱好。呢對鵪鶉脾有令我驚艷到。😍但我最愛其實係呢道菜既Side dish。🤭但薯蓉真係搞唔掂，一口接住一口咁食。薯蓉上邊有幾片黑松露，個口感好綿密好軟。唔係普通既薯蓉係混合左奶油。🤤    3. King Crab and Avocado Cannelloni, with Citrus and Vanilla Condiments  對於唔食牛油果既我，都比呢道菜吸引左。😍用牛油果包住帝王蟹，外層仲放上咸香既魚子醬。成道菜超級鮮。牛油果🥑同蟹🦀既配合太完美了。    今次係第一次去米芝連餐廳，成個好奇寶寶咁。一開始仲唔敢周圍影下相。🤭成個環境好舒服餐廳格調係黑紅黑紅。🔴⚫️    同埋一去到就上左一大盆餐包，有各式各樣每款兩個，我諗返起都有成十幾二十個包。😂另外，臨走既時候佢仲會幫你打包好未食既包。😚最後最後，令我最心心念念係最後送既朱古力磅蛋糕🥹真係超級超級好食，超濃朱古力味。勁想再食但之後去過佢地cafe都好似唔多見有得買。    呢間一定會再返去食，但我就Bookmark左下次去東京個間😙因為惠比壽個間太有feel☺️    ______________________________  💰價錢: HKD $2500-3000/ Per one    😋味道: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️    📍地址: 中環皇后大道中15號置地廣場4樓401號舖    #hongkong#hkfoodie#hkig#foodgasm#foodphotography#hkfoodblogger #hongkong"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,30,Robuchon should be better! Food great but complacency.,I have been dining at Robuchon as a guest of a generous friend for over 15 years . He is a frequent patron for lunch and dinner - probably the most frequent patron . While the ambience and food are excellent the time that we have to wait for the various courses is consistently disappointing . Regularly replenished baskets of bread fill the gap - perhaps to compensate for the modest portions when they eventually arrive in front of you - but this is but what you expect from a restaurant with a global reputation . This is a view shared by all my friends’ guests and needs to be heeded by the management . General Manager please take note .

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,10,Surprised they still have 3 Michelin stars!!,"Shocked that they still have 3 Michelin stars! We last visited before COVID and it was splendid back then. This most recent visit was a disappointment: food was very average (only their signature mashed potato was memorable); service was terrible and you can see poor coordination and communication amongst staff, at one stage a chef came out of the kitchen to shout at the waitstaff, and we waited 50 minutes for our dessert. Hygiene also questionable as the dessert trolley was just exposed the whole time, most items without lids/coverings. The decor is the same as before (i.e. can see a lot of wear and tear). We also picked the cheese trolley, the manager did not even bother explaining the cheeses, just asked what we wanted; we later saw the same manager explaining thoroughly the different types of cheese to some customers in the VIP room (in contrast, when we visit L’Envol, they always take time to explain their cheeses to all customers, perhaps they treat all customers as VIP, something Robuchon should learn). In short, absolutely no interest to visit again and will recommend that friends skip this mediocre but expensive fine dining restaurant from now on."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Maintained its 3-star glamour and taste,"It has been more than six years since my last visit, and this restaurant has continued to maintain its Michelin 3-star status, now for nine consecutive years, so it is with expectation we return tonight to explore what new experience it has installed for us.    The décor has not changed, with the counter seats surrounding the open kitchen, with the colourful bell peppers and other vegetables decorating the stainless-steel frames, with also the black and red tone creating a warm and intimate atmosphere.    We both order the 9-course Signature Menu ($2,980) and I also opt for wine pairing ($1,450). To start, the staff brings us the Breadbasket, with an assortment of different bread made in-house. Bringing back good memories, we need to remind ourselves not to eat too many before the course begins.    The Amuse Bouche is Waffle, with the fillings comprising some Langoustine from New Zealand and Hokkaido Sea Urchin, mixed with Bechamel Sauce, before baking them. The crunchy texture of the waffle, with the creamy and tasty fillings, is an amazing starter and set us up with high anticipation on the courses to come.    The first course is Sologne Imperial Caviar. Presented beautifully in an egg-shaped container, the abundance of caviar forms the bottom, with the Lobster Jelly forming the middle layer, and the Cauliflower Cream being the top part. While a bit salty on its own, the caviar and lobster jelly have great umami flavours, becoming balance with the touch of the cream. The wine paired is Ruinart Blanc de Blancs.    The second course is Rock Lobster. Another great presentation, the Australian lobster meat has been slow cooked to keep its crunchy texture, and then brushed with a thin layer of lobster broth jelly on top to enhance its flavours. With a slice of Black Truffle to enrich the fragrance, the most amazing part for me is in fact the Macedonia Salad underneath, made with finely chopped pieces of Carrot, Peas, Tobiko, with hints of Cayenne Pepper to give a light spicy note to the poppy texture. The sauce on the bottom is a mix of black and white, made from Balsamic Vinegar and Mayonnaise. The wine paired is 2017 Arnaud Lambert Clos David Saumar Breze.    The third course is Baby Artichokes, the most tender and prized portion of the vegetable, which has been deep-fried in tempura style with a thin layer of batter. A Puree made with Artichokes and Chickpea offers a creamy and flavourful complement, and together with the Curcuma Emulsion with its unique earthy flavour and Piquillo Pepper extract of its sweet note, is delicious and not in any way heavy or oily. The wine paired is 2014 Markus Molitor Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Spatlese.    The fourth course is Raviolis. The raviolis, for me, are a touch undercooked, with the texture of the dough still a bit too hard. The fillings are however very tasty, with the runny cheese providing a gratifying experience on the bite. The Comte Foam, with the finely chopped Black Truffle and shaved cheese, is highly complementary on the palate. The wine paired is an interesting 1999 Chateau Musar Blanc.    The fifth course is Pan-Seared Sea Scallop. The large Hokkaido scallop has been beautifully pan-seared and caramelized, and the chef has added some spring onion, grated ginger, and leek as condiment on top. On the side there is some shiso flowers to add colour and fragrance, together with Sologne Caviar and celeriac. The sauce is a special Kumquat Reduction, with the citrus flavours appealing, also having good acidity to give vibrancy to the dish. The wine paired is 2020 Marco Capra Bricco Dalle Merende Moscato d’Asti.    The sixth course is Roasted Maine Lobster, serving with both the tail and claw. On top of the meat is a crisp made with the lobster brown meat, on top of some Baby Spinach together with Wasabi foam. The chef has taken a creative twist and breaking down the Bearnaise Sauce into its three components of Egg Yolk sauce, Tarragon, and Shallot to go with the lobster. Very tasty. The wine paired is 2007 Domaine Bouchard Corton Charlemagne.    The seventh course is Free-Range Quail and Foie Gras. My favourite dish in the evening, the quail breast is cooked to pink and seasoned perfectly, tender, and juicy, with the foie gras lightly seared on top, giving a soft silky bite. Together with Wild Girolles Mushrooms and Parsley, the earthy note of the mushroom provides the wonderful marriage in flavours, with the jus impeccable in taste. On the side the chef has prepared some silky creamy Mashed Potato, as well as a cup of Consommé with intense flavours. I am amazed how the consommé can remove the heaviness of the course. The wine paired is 2011 Louis Jadot Vosne-Romanee Les Beaux Monts.    The eighth course is Smooth Passionfruit Cream with Rum Granita and Coconut Mousse. Served in a cup and on first impression reminds me of an iced coffee, this dessert has multi-dimension of flavours, with the bottom layer of pineapple and passionfruit cream slightly sour to contrast with the bitter rum granita providing refreshing, palate cleansing effect. The coconut mousse is soft and linked up all the elements of the different flavours nicely, and per the suggestion of the chef, each scoop should pick up all the three layers to enjoy in one go.    The ninth course is Fresh Raspberries. The presentation is beautiful, with Lychee Chocolate Cream on the bottom layer, follows by a Raspberry Jelly in the middle, and on top are the Raspberry Sorbet with some Fresh Raspberries. The dessert has a great balance of sweet and sourness, and while the raspberry is featured in multiple formats, we do not feel boring. The wine paired is 2008 Chateau Suduiraut.    Included in the menu is Coffee or Tea, and I pick a Double-Espresso, with Home-Made Caramel to go with, while my wife opts for Peppermint Tea. The staff also very thoughtfully ask whether we want to pack the breads home, which we happily say yes.    The Petits Fours include Madeleine, Earl-Grey Flavoured Macaron, and Dark Chocolate. All these small pieces are tasty and go extremely well with the coffee, finishing our wonderful, satisfying meal on a high note.    The service is nice, with the sommelier and staff helpful in explaining all the courses, but perhaps they can go a bit deeper into the details like how the chef prepares the dish and the origins of ingredients. The bill is $8,270 and while it is not cheap, I can appreciate why the restaurant has been able to retain its 3-star status all these years, and I look forward to returning, hopefully not having to wait for another six years."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,A good meal to start a year,"I’d lunch in Joël Robuchon with a friend who hadn’t been there before. I’d booked a table so that he’d try the desserts from the dessert trolley which isn’t available in the counter area.    The meal was as good as always. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service too.    I only took 3 courses since I wasn’t hungry and I’d already tried both soups on the menu during my previous visits to the restaurant.    When I knew pâte en croûte (one of my favourite dishes of the restaurant which hadn’t been made for more than a year), I immediately decided to take it. Le cochon ibérique was sublime. Pluma is the rarest cut of the prestigious Iberian pork and is taken from the neck end of pork loin. The meat, which was served medium rare, was very tender, succulent and flavourful.    Only when I saw the bill did I realise there’d been a slight increase of price. Still, it’s value for money."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,My favorite daily restaurant all times,This is second times for the new chef's creation. Food is better than the first time. Some dishes are nicer and some dishes are not. I think the desert has bigger room to improve. I will come back as usual 😊

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,2 meals in a row,"I booked lunch in Joël Robuchon about 3 months ago. Nowadays the restaurant accepts bookings up to 3 months and it’s so popular for lunch that I usually need to call 3 months in advance to secure a reservation.    Only after I’d booked lunch did a friend invite me to her birthday dinner in the same restaurant (the day immediately after the date of my lunch). In the end, I went to both dinner and lunch.    We’d a private room for dinner and counter seats for lunch. I enjoyed both meals (each with a different group of friends). The food was exquisite and delicious.    Of course dinner was more sumptuous and lasted much longer. The menu featured a number of signature dishes of the restaurant, most of which were made with luxurious ingredients like caviar, white truffle, langoustine, lobster and wagyu beef. There’re 2 choices for the main course (quail or beef). On the recommendation of the staff, most of us chose Chateaubriand beef with foie gras in Rossini style in vintage Port wine sauce. It’s sublime and undoubtedly the best dish of the night.    I only took 3 courses for lunch after a big dinner the night before. The dishes were lighter but still delicious."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,2nd New chef here in a year,"The previous three stars chef is no longer working here. The chef I had today is the second new one in this half year. He is better than the previous one but may not be as good as the three stars one.  The free starter (something like crab steam egg?) was worse than before as he added too much ginger. It was not as sweet N ginger overpowered the whole dish.  My friend ordered poached egg which I found the chef may consider using a better Japanese egg(蘭王）in order to get stronger egg taste, he should use cheese n ham instead of crispy fried rice outside.  I ordered Foie Gras with cold corn soup.  It tasted ok but slightly too salty and it need more wine jelly for balance the taste.    For the main, I had slow cook piegon(+HKD280) which I found it heavenly, it is much better than the 3stars chef 's one. I give it full score. However, mashed potatoes can be more airy and smoother.  My friend has lobster spagetti(+HKD190?), which was lack of salt. It was better than the 3 stars chef one but still not a perfect dish.  I ordered chestnut desert which was good but not extraordinary , my friend said it is slightly too sweet but I can accept it. My friend had a vanilla cream cake which was below standard as not enough vanilla taste.  The price is higer as the pigeon dish did not have surcharge last year. But I will be back even it is not extremely good value as before."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Rewarding Signature Menu,"L'Atelier is part of a group of three eateries by legendary French chef Joel Robuchon that are situated at the Landmark Atrium in Central. It is an open kitchen concept with the expected colour scheme and fine dining experience which has been consistently very good over the years. Opening hours are 12pm to 2.30pm (lunch) and 6-10pm (dinner), advance reservations are required for seating.    We have had mostly very rewarding meals here over the years including a recent dinner, whereby we enjoyed the Signature Meal, featuring 8 courses along with their famous bread basket as well as coffee and petit four. Note, there are 3-5 course set lunches and you can order directly off the a la carte menu as well if preferred. With the Signature Meal, you need to allow for a 3 hour dinner. Further note that the kitchen can accommodate those with allergies by modifying the menu, creating different dishes for those in need.    Courses are spaced out well, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without rushing. Servers do an expectedly nice job explaining what is served. Sommelier wine recommendations have always seemed to work just fine for us. Sometimes a bottle is nice to have with dinner or with meals like the Signature Menu which as many different type courses, a mix of white and reds throughout the meal works even better.    During our recent meal, everything went smoothly and we had a lovely evening. Can't complain about any of the courses served, all of which were refined, demonstrating knowledge of ingredients and skill in the kitchen. In fact, with the open kitchen concept, you can watch the chef directing his team who manage dish preparation who then pass off dishes to the team of service staff, who bring out and introduce your dishes in a timely and seamless manner.    Of the courses tried during this meal, most memorable were the La Truffle Blanche, a soft boiled egg on golden pearl risotto, topped with white alba truffle that was very fragrant and strongly flavoured. We also adored Le Foie Gras, a pan fried duck foie gras served with a vibrant Japanese grape. This was a beautiful balance of flavours, a wonderful course.    As part of the Signature Menu you choose between two mains. We tried one each, they were both excellent. La Caille was very, very good. The free-range quail natural flavours were wonderful and accentuated nicely with foie gras. Le Boeuf, was a serving of two Wagyu beef strips and artichoke heart. Chef recommends the beef at medium rare and best to take your order this way. The fats are released nicely, adding tremendous flavour to the beef, just chew slowly and enjoy. The artichoke was strong and delicious, it combined nicely with the wagyu. This was another great course serving. Yet, we both felt that the wagyu and artichoke were so very good on their own that eating them together made for a bit of a distraction - a nice little problem to have in the end.    Our meal concluded with dessert, excellent coffee and petit four. We left feeling that everything had gone just as expected with excellent service, beautiful and delicious courses and an overall rewarding meal experience, one will no doubt look forward to enjoying again in the future."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,An exaggerated reputation?,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is without a doubt one of the most recognized French restaurants in the world. This one in Hong Kong is split into two areas, one with bar table seating and the other with regular table seating.    I chose the regular table area, where the small portion menu, which is exclusively available at the bar table, was not offered. Throughout the meal, the most of the foods were average and nothing particularly memorable.  Food was not bad, but it was of such quality that you'd forget what you'd eaten a week later.    Dishes were introduced briefly and rapidly. I also overheard the conflicts of staffs occasionally.    I won't say I'll never return, but there should be a strong reason for me to do so in the future."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Striking experience,"The decor was dark and striking, with dark walls and seats. Food was excellent, with the dessert winning the prize."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,米芝蓮三星法國🇫🇷菜,"第一次來吃晚餐，試了signature set  無論食材、烹調方法、味道和食物精緻度也很好，非常滿意的一餐。    頭盤是imperial caviar  滿滿的一份caviar ，下面放了高湯啫喱和蟹肉，味道鮮甜美味。    Pan-seared scallop with green curry and coriander sauce , squid ink farfalle  日本帶子鮮甜無比。外面和裏面也煎得剛剛好，不會過熟。    Hokkaido sea urchin fregola with saffron  海膽fregola （珍珠麵）有濃濃的海膽味，加上黑松露，味道更有層次。    Grilled lobster served with green peas and wasabi  龍蝦肉外面卷著煙肉。  龍蝦肉肉非常厚，味道很鮮甜。煙肉有一點油膩，wasabi 剛好可以減淡油膩感。    Pan seared Japanese wagyu beef with eggplant and turmeric condiment  和牛油脂分布平均，入口即化。  唯一是我點了medium rare ，有一點過於油膩，和牛還是煎熟一點油膩感才不會太重。    只訂到bar 枱位置，也不會不舒服。staff 服務非常有禮及周到。  喜歡吃法國菜的人，建議一試。  有機會想吃其他國家的robuchon 。"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,One of my favourites,"Joël Robuchon is one of my favourite French restaurants in Hong Kong.    Both my friend and I enjoyed our lunch very much. Even though I’ve been there many times, I still find the food consistently good. And I usually find something new which I like.    Everything (amuse bouche, entrée, soup, main course, dessert and mignardises) was delicious. I particularly liked my main course, grilled Challans duck with cherry confit, almonds and girolles. The meat was incredibly tender and the skin crispy. The famed mashed potato which came with the dish was so good that I couldn’t resist finishing it all.    It’s necessary to book well in advance. But, it’s worth the trouble and the wait especially when I still can’t travel to France due to the pandemic."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Exquisite,"It’s been a while since I write about this wonderful place even if I go there at least 10 times a year...  I absolutely love this place: the place itself modern, refined and chic.. every details is thought of!  The service is perfect friendly and efficient.  I love open kitchens and I like to see all the staff cooking and paying attention to every tiny details in order to make the customer happy to discover first a scenery..  The dishes are exquisite : seasoned, Perfectly cooked.  I like that the chef go to the tables to introduce himsel and check if everything is doing well.  Thank you for these moments of pure happiness.    Happy French customers who will relocate soon to Portugal"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Excellent lunch,"An excellent lunch - only 3 set lunches available due to virus, but the food and overall experience was excellent.  Starting from under HKD 600 this actually was very good value for money - considering most of the other western options in Hong Kong fall short of the mark this will my new go to place - had not been for some years. Recommended."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Four courses lunch - technique and precision,"J. Robuchon is a Michelin 3-star restaurant in HK and has international footprint. Due to such renowned chef I have very high expectations    Starting from making reservation I must say the restaurant didn’t disappoint The hostess was quick and polite in responding guests’ requests.    Walking into the restaurant , it was a consistent black and red deco. The bar facing the kitchen allows guests to have a peep over all the happenings in the busy kitchen.    We ordered the four courses lunch set.    The amuse bouch - very impressed . It tasted wow. Pure wow. I couldn’t recall the exact dish - it was a fish tartar with fish roe, crisp and edible gold . That sauce omg was devine. I wish I have jotted note of the dish on the spot.    The starter - ravioli. I found this dish was ok, not wow . Given it was ravioli with lobster , taste wise it couldn’t go wrong. The ravioli was not the traditional one, rather it was a few ravioli sheets assembled into a mini tower packaging the lobster.    The soup - dashi. Wow ! I could taste the dashi but it was rather subtle and not as distinct as the usual dashi stock.    The main - chicken. Again wow wow wow. I am very impressed with the technique. The chicken was pan fried crispy, it must have been slow cooked in water bath , it was so moist. The foie gras wrapped inside added to the moisture . I would have liked a tad more of the foam or sauce tho.    Dessert - Mont Blanc. . Whenever I have the opportunity I would defo order this dessert as it is incredibly troublesome and time consuming to make. That butterfly crisp and the precision, so good.    Petite four - I was impressed again by the precision and the tiny details on even the petite fours . Amazing .    Last note on the service - give it was a 3 Michelin star restaurant I must say I am not impressed. The service was professional yet a bit standoff-ish and robotic. I ordered a glass of wine but I felt uneasy when I asked to taste a second wine . One of the my friend tasted 6 different bottles when she just ordered two glasses in one of the top restaurants in Sydney and yet the sommelier didn’t have any attitude. I don’t mean the restaurant should allow guests to taste wine in an unreasonable manner but the restaurant should never give the guest an welcome feeling.    I will defo revisit the restaurant to try other dishes on the menu and will defo come back for that luxurious tasting menu."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Leisurely weekday lunch,"During my previous visits to L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, I’d always dined at the section with separate tables. However, when I called in late October, only bar seats would be available on the date I wished to book.    It turned out the bar seats were still very comfortable. Due to the current restaurant capacity restriction, there’s more than ample space between the seats.    Both my friend and I took the 4-couse lunch menu. Everything, from amuse bouche to mignardises, was delicious. Even the cappuccino was very good.    My friend took the egg with Alba white truffle as appetiser (with a supplement). When the staff took the white truffle from the wooden box, we immediately smelt the unique aroma, which was much stronger than that of the white truffle we’d at 208 Duecento Otto last week. Autumn is the best season for chestnut soup and it didn’t disappoint. I generally don’t like lukewarm food and on the recommendation of the staff I chose the braised Wagyu beef cheek as main course. It’s nicely executed and the meat was very flavourful and so tender that it literally fell apart when I cut it softly. Both the Mont Blanc and chocolate desserts were divine.    The service was impeccable. The staff were very knowledgeable about the ingredients and dishes.    Top dining experience which lived up to the Robuchon name and the 3-star status."

Kadowaki,40,Pricey,"The food here is undoubtedly good but it is rather heavy for Japanese cuisine and the price is quite steep. Not exactly value for money. However, if you are willing to pay the price, it is definitely worth going as the food is excellent."

Kadowaki,50,Good and healthy food!,"We liked food, service, given space (small compartment). Not easy to find entrance (use images from google). Reasonable level of English helps to understand what you can eat."

Kadowaki,40,Fubu and Truffles,My family and I managed to get a last-minute reservation to this very small and intimate restaurant in Ropongi that only serves a few people a night in its counter seating or small private rooms. When making the reservation (through The Peninsula hotel) we pre-ordered...More

Kadowaki,50,Fantastic food - must come if you can get a table,"The food is simply fabulous here. Japanese food with a twist but not in the molecular way - just really fresh ingredients cooked really well. Lots of work and thought are put into the dishes, so definitely deserves it two Michelin stars!"

Kadowaki,20,Overrated and priced,"Went there couple of times but this time the place has become traditional , not creative anymore with prices beyond reason. Ok there is the famous truffle rice , but then no surprise except the ever high price"

Kadowaki,40,Fubu and Truffles,"My family and I managed to get a last-minute reservation to this very small and intimate restaurant in Ropongi that only serves a few people a night in its counter seating or small private rooms. When making the reservation (through The Peninsula hotel) we pre-ordered the fubu, or blowfish, pre-set tasting menu.    Despite the very exotic taste profile of the restaurant's cuisine, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The raw sashimi fubu was a little rough because of the nature of the preparation. This venomous fish tends to be tough and chewy unlike other fish commonly used for sashimi. However, when fried it is very tasty and enjoyable. This and the truffled rice were definitely the highlights of the night. I had never seen so many truffle shavings in a single dish, the server covered the bed of rice with a heaping amount just before our eyes, quite exciting!    The biggest downside of Kadowaki, however, was the wait time and ambiance. Before being seated we had to wait in a tiny bar-private-room that smelled strongly of tobacco. Overall the dining experience felt a little secluded, however, it's understandable given that the restaurant is a two-time Michelin star winner that focuses solely on food.    If you're in Tokyo and are somewhat of an adventurer I recommend you check Kadowaki out. After all, there's only a handful of places that are licensed to serve fubu in the world, it's quite the experience!"

Kadowaki,50,Date Night,"My wife and I lived in Tokyo for 4.5 years and dinned at Kadowaki a couple of Christmas Eve's (date night in Japan).    We would agree with the reviewer that notes the menu does not deviate that much (we only visited in December x3). However what you get is excellent and watching the action from the counter is part of the experience. We also found the price on par with the many high quality culinary experiences available in Japan.    If you love food, this is a great place to indulge with a date."

Kadowaki,50,Fantastic food - must come if you can get a table,"The food is simply fabulous here.

Kadowaki,20,Overrated and priced,"Went there couple of times but this time the place has become traditional , not creative anymore with prices beyond reason. Ok there is the famous truffle rice , but then no surprise except the ever high price"

Kadowaki,40,Truffle-icious variations on the classics,"Wonderful discovery- but well known on the local Tokyo circuit, the chef has a passion for variations on Japanese classics.    We went with a set meal- and each dish was better than the next. Tokyo really is a foodie's paradise.    Of particular note was the fact that the Chef was using copious amounts of fresh truffles from France on several of the dishes- which after a week of Kaiseki meals, gave us a whole new dimensions of the flavors one can take Japanese haute cuisine to.    Niggles (which is why I didnt rate this restaurant excellent)- the private dining room while nice, was hard to be served in and for 1 or 2 Michelin stars, having to pass the food around the table really was not my idea of fine dining- not a deal breaker, but definitely would get dinged in Europe or the US.    Would return and warmly recommend."

Ta Vie,50,Depends on how you expect,"Excellent for the food, but the point is that it seems that Italian and Japanese rather than French & Japanese especially what the pasta shows. On the other, their English level is enough to offer the service and help consumers solving any kind of issues, but I hope that next time when I come they can show that they have already improved their English. However, good for anything and will go there again as a customer rather than a teacher."

Ta Vie,10,Horrible & Greedy,"The place is just a joke, when I make the reservation we have told the table would available on either at 6pm or 8 pm, that means we have left our table after an hour and half?  Their standard 8 course menu is HK$2,980 + 10% services charges = not less $3,300 per head i.e. something around GBP350.  Not sure how a mitchelin 3 star restaurant would offer such a rush & greedy dining experience.     Whether or not we would ever go with this less than 2 hours 8 course £350 Michelin restaurant? Well… there has a lot of excellent restaurants would allow reasonable timing for the customers, and I would consider them first. "

Ta Vie,30,A night to remember or not,"It has been a long time since I have done any reviews because of Covid and I honestly got lazy.  But now that life has been restored to normality I thought I owe it to myself and everyone to write a review.  I hope I am not making anyone angry by giving Ta Vie a rating of 3. I would actually have given it a 3.8 if I could, but I did not want to round it up to 4 for reasons I shall explain.  First kudos to where it deserves, the communication from the moment of booking till the date of the meal was great.  The bread served was fantastic. The actual courses served was also good but not exceptional.  However, given the price point of this restaurant I was expecting the server / maitre d' to ask us how the food was given that my guest had left a good portion of the main course untouched. I just wanted to share my views with the maitre d' or server about why the food was not finished, but I was never given the chance.  In most restaurants (in particular in restaurants of this caliber) I would get asked about how the food was or why it was not finished either at the time when the plates are cleared or at the end of the meal when I ask for the bill. But this did not happen.  I was just presented with the bill and a very polite good bye given.  Some might argue that I should just share my views non the less at the end when asking for the bill despite not being asked, but I did not want to do this in front of my guest.  My experience even in much lesser restaurants with a far far lower price point I would be asked how my food was when the plates are cleared, let alone uneaten. But no such enquiry was made by the staff.  Some might question me as nit picking...perhaps I am, but when the meal cost over HKD3000 per person (dinner menu) a bit more scrutiny is applied.  I cannot say I am not satisfied with the food, but was I wowed? Was it worth the HKD 3000 per head? I leave this as an open question for others to answer."

Ta Vie,40,Overprice for the whole experience,"We booked a dinner to celebrate my birthday here at Ta Vie. It is a two stars restaurant.  The first starter is Aburi lightly torched Aori squid, grilled avocado with French Oscietra caviar. I and my daughter think this is a disaster as the avocado overpowered caviar and three items together do not have any connection elements.  The second starter is much better and I give it a perfect score which is Lobster and Japanese turnip warm salad , turnip leaf oil, Stilton sauce, fresh apple, the lobster is perfectly cook and match perfectly with turnip leaf oil.  Next corse is House made pasta with Aonori seaweed sauce topped with Hokkaido fresh Uni, this course is perfectly cook but not extraordinary in term of taste.  The first main course is charcoal grilled Kinmedai with crispy scales. This one is extraordinary and heavenly.  The second main course is charcoal grilled wagyu beef ribeyes smoked with Hoba leaf arima pepper sauce. The wagu beef is a bit chewy and the steak knife is not sharp enough. The desert is Pistachio tart which is not ok. The taste of pistachio not balancing good enough with mandarin. The final desert is much better which name winter forest with chocolate, whisky, dates, pu'er tea which is well balance.  To end the dining experience, u can chose tea, herbal tea and coffee, i recommend coffee or tea instead of herbal tea. All of this come with little treats like chocolate mousse with coffee, Pina cotta with herbal tea etc. This is a perfect ending.  Overall the dinning experience is like riding roller coaster. From soso to excellent and then good to soso and very good again.  With the high price tag 330USD+10%. I am expecting a perfect dinning experience with only 10% fail room. Therfore I can only give it a four stars.    Service is extraordinary, unfortunately the setting of restaurants is not up to date. It need renovation due to current HK situation. Dinner always move to lunch time. This is unacceptable to charge this price with this dated setting."

Ta Vie,50,Well deserve its 2-star status...,"This French restaurant is managed by chef Hideaki Sato and has been awarded Michelin 2-star status. Located in The Pottinger Hong Kong, we came on the Boxing Day for lunch, as the dinner service is not available with the government's current restriction measures on social gathering.    Greeted warmly, we were shown to our table. The décor is very comfortable and relaxing, cleverly using live plants and details on the decoration and setting to create a cozy ambience. I like how the dated texture of the wooden floorboards and cabinet giving me a feel of visiting a place with history.    We ordered the special Winter Festive Season Menu ($2,180 each), with me also going for the wine pairing ($1,280). The restaurant also offers a wide range of wine, as well as sake too. Even the bottled natural water Azumino ($88) is special, coming from Nagano in Japan.    The first course is 'Crab House Sandwich'. Very interesting on the presentation, the crispy buckwheat crepe has a crab shape, and underneath is Hokkaido kegani (horsehair) crab salad. The crab meat is very delicious, and together with avocado, tomato, thin radish slices and a nice dressing which blends all the flavors together, with a perfect acidity to make this a wonderful starter of the meal. The wine paired is Paul Bara Reserve Brut Champagne NV with the crisp acidity refreshing and complimentary.    The second course is Duck Consommé. The delicate yet intense soup is certainly mind-blowingly delicious, and there are also house-made ravioli contained duck meat, as well as a poached oyster from Hokkaido Akkeshi of silky texture. The flavors are further enriched by the black truffle strips on top. The wine paired is Famille Plageoles Vin de Voile 2008, with the oxidative aromas and taste matching well with the consommé.    The third course is Deep-fried Lung Guang Chicken Wing. A signature of the restaurant, the chicken wing has the bone removed and then stuffed with Jpanaese burdock and white truffle rice, before deep-fried to give a crispy skin. Underneath are some pea sprout which is right in season, and added with an intense Shaoxing wine sauce. With a few shaves of truffle on top, this is another great dish which is a must-try in my opinion. The wine paired is Domaine de Montille Beaune 1er Cru Greves 2015. The earthy notes are a good match with sauce.    The fourth course is Pan Seared Langoustine. Another of my favorites, the langoustine is wrapped with a thin puff pastry to reminiscent of a crispy edible shell. The langoustine itself is very good, fresh and very tasty, great in both appearance and flavors. There are also the seasonal parsnips which added a different texture to the dish. The wine paired is a wine from Yamanashi, Adega d'Arvga Bosque 2017 made from local variety Koshu with good mineral notes to match with the langoustine.    The fifth course is Wagyu Beef 'Rossini', with a piece of nice Nozaki Wagyu beef as well as a piece of foie gras wrapped in a brioche, paired with red wine sauce and some black truffle. Both of us always are shy of the fatty meat, but I found it amazing that both the beef and foie gras did not show any oiliness, simply perfect on how they are cooked. Wonderfully done, the wine paired is also beautiful, with the 1995 Clos du Marquis offering a nice savory development to the dish.    Before transitioning to dessert, we are given a cup of home-made hibiscus beverage, which helps to cleanse the palate. It is very refreshing and I wonder whether the chef can share the recipe as I want to make this at home as it is so good.    The sixth course is Fresh Japanaese Pear 'Le Lectier', with a sponge cake soaked with pear liqueur on the bottom, with the fresh and juicy pear on top, on top with a fresh cheese ice-cream and beautiful garnish. A piece of art, it also delivers on the flavors, with the pear liqueur strong but balanced with the sweetness from the ice-cream, and the delicate of the pear is not suppressed interestingly. The wine paired is spirit from Capovilla Distillati, using Decio di Belfiore apples.    With an Indonesia Coffee (dripped by French press) to wrap up, the restaurant also provided a chocolate mousse dessert to pair which is highly complementary. A very good meal, and the portion size is also appropriate, making us full but not overly so, enabling us to really savor all the dishes to the complete extent.    The service is very good, with the staff attentive to our needs without asking and able to remain 'invisible' most of the times to allow a good privacy on the conversations. Chef Hideaki Sato also came to introduce a couple of dishes himself, and both of us were amazed by his young and handsome look. Definitely the quality of a celebrity chef.    The bill was $6,301 which is a bit expensive but considering the quality of the food, the choice of wines, and the overall dining experience, I would say it is worth the price tag. As chef Hideaki Sato personally written on the menu, his motto is 'pure, simple, seasonal' and I truly can relate to that through his dishes. It is one of the most pleasant meals I had for a while and for that, I wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant."

Ta Vie,50,Fantastic French cuisine,"Sampled Ta Vie’s four course lunch. It is not surprising that every course was prepared to well perfection. Surprisingly, their home made bread, butter and cheese were so nice that we couldn’t control ourselves to finish them all albeit fatty concern. Ta Vie’s Michelin star rating is well derserved."

Ta Vie,40,An Ordinary 2-Star Michelin Restaurant,"My friend and I grabbed the chance to try out Ta Vie’s lunch menu during restaurant week. The dining experience was very ordinary, which didn’t quite match up with its 2 Michelin stars.    My friend and I are huge bread lovers. These warm house bread got our heart with their crispy crust and fluffy bread. Second round of sourdough was great too.    I chose this Foie gras and dried figs terrine as appetizer. The foie gras was great, not too stuffy nor heavy, probably because of the refreshing figs sauce layers in between. The peanut butter on figs was a nice surprise that went well with the foie gras and figs.    Second dish was this House made pasta with “Aonori” topped with Hokkaido “Bafun” uni. The sea urchi was so fresh and sweet, very delightful. The seaweed was so refreshing. A delicious dish indeed.    Main course was Roasted French milk fed veal from Burgundy. The seasoned turnip and potato pieces were actually more attractive than the veal itself. The veal was really ordinary…    The overall dining experience was okay, and the food was great, but not up to our expectations of a Michelin 2-star restaurant. Luckily we got a deal from restaurant week to try out this lunch menu without feeling really ripped off."

Ta Vie,30,Business lunch,Set menu with 4 courses for lunch. The food is barely impressive but the service is definitely unprofessional. The waitresses are interrupting and presenting the dishes or the bread and the cutlery from both sides. The dishes are explained in an annoying and not appetizing manner.

Ta Vie,30,Desserts were good,"I was invited to a birthday dinner at Ta Vie. Due to some prior engagements, I only joined for desserts, cakes and drinks.    All my friends had the tasting menu which included 2 desserts. Both of them, especially mont blanc with Pu’er tea ice-cream, were good. The melon birthday cake looked really nice and was delicious too."

Ta Vie,50,Love it,"I went there for my birthday celebration and due to some personal problems, I had to change my booking a few times and thanks to Ms Takano San, who had been very accommodating and patient with our email communication.    It was a tasty meal with a price tag on the high side. However, after taking into account the exquisiteness and seasonality of the ingredients used and the detailed and meticulous cooking, I think the money was well spent.    IMHO, the food tasted more on the Japanese side i.e. the flavour was more pure and simple to pay homage to the ingredients and was less complicated or as strong as the French cuisine. Both my son and I appreciated such subtlety.    Service was impeccable with genuine hospitality. To my pleasant surprise, Chef Sato served two of the eight courses to the table personally.    The dining experience was delightful and it's an enjoyable evening. Don't expect anything gimmicky. It's just about savoring the natural and original taste of the food.    I will definitely return as it doesn't hurt once in a while to splurge on a special occasion."

Ta Vie,50,Special Occasion Meal,"Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday....walked out feeling very satisfied.    Highlights: Caesar salad topped with Hotaru squid, grilled Hokki clam with Taiwanese bamboo shoot, and roasted Aveyron lamb.    We did the wine pairing and thought it was good (wheat bear, sweet sake, sherry)....but probably not worth the price tag."

Ta Vie,50,Fantastic experience,"Awesome restaurant, French cuisine from Japanese Chef, very attentive service and delicous food. Beautiful desserts."

Ta Vie,40,Let’s start the journey,"Being ranked #16 on Asia’s top 50 with 2 Michelin stars, Chef Sato did not disappoint. We had the Winter Special menu and it was a delightful culinary journey. Every course was delicately plated and the taste was good. His signature dish “Braised abalone covered with abalone shell” was indeed memorable. We could see the Chef’s great attention to details in everything. Even the water they served was one of a kind from Japan. After the delicious champagne, we also tried a bottle of lovely Japanese white wine made with Japanese grapes. Service was friendly and attentive. The intimate dining room was very cozy. Chef Sato came to say goodbye when we left and it was a very nice touch.    I only wish there were no truffle and caviar. These two expensive ingredients are so overly used by Michelin star chefs nowadays in their dishes, I found these ingredients with such a strong character only made something special less special."

Ta Vie,50,Extraordinary Meal,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at Ta Vie. We enjoyed it immensely. Everything from the food to the ambience to the service to the attitude. All hit the right spots. First, we sat down - they stagger arrivals so that even with just two or so wait staff, no one feels unattended. The pacing and quality of the food is extraordinary. Every dish flows from the next - innovative without being gimmicky. I cannot recommend this highly enough to anyone seeking a romantic evening"

Ta Vie,50,Great place to dine,1 Michelin star French – Japanese fine dining. Is now one of my favorite fine dining restaurants. The food is excellent – the right balance of traditional and creative. Dishes are inspiring / unexpected but are executed well. Every dish from amuse bouche to desserts were fantastic. Strongly recommend.    Service was very welcoming.

Ta Vie,50,Expensive but quality food and very friendly setvide,"Went there for our anniversary after going there for business lunches and dinner and the missus felt left out!    The service was warm and very good for Hong Kong. The food was excellent - if you like fresh ingredients cooked in a way that squeezes out the natural flavours in a subtle and non-overpowering way then this is for you!    We had the crab starter - one of the best I’ve had in Hong Kong where the meat was fresh and very sweet. The avocado was delicious too. The soup was earthy and paired well with the onsen egg. And their signature dish the pasta uni in a seaweed sauce was as expected - tasting the sea!    The aubergine showed off the freshness and quality of the ingredients but one of the highlights for me was the fish and especially the crispy skin which was off the charts! For those of you who like abalone, this fish was extremely flavourful with the abalone liver sauce and an edible ‘shell’. I found the wagyu beef average not because it wasn’t well cooked or melt in your mouth, but more because the other dishes were so special!    Another highlight was the first dessert of lotus, jasmine and banana. Just when you thought the banana was too overpowering, the taste of the lotus kicks and then it ends with the banana coming through again. Very subtle and fresh and interesting! The last fish was pure fusion - ice cream with crunchy goji berries and salted egg yolk!    The bill came to $3,500 each which is expensive but we did go for the wine pairing option and ordered extra white truffles. Not cheap but definitely one of the better restaurants in Hong Kong if the quality of the food and subtlety of the cooking is top priority!"

Ta Vie,30,Exquisite ingredients with a steep price tag,"Expect dishes with exquisite ingredients that you would not easily get anywhere else (see attached menu and dish photos), and the service was good Japanese standard - polite, but not overly warm.    However, come equipped with a thick wallet. All in all, we felt that we overpaid despite the expensive ingredients and that you can get a better deal at other fine dining places. The bill came to ~HK$ 5500 for two persons for the tasting menu (you can't choose, it's set), two aperitifs and our own bottle of wine (corkage fee HK$ 500).    We were happy with most dishes, the ones that stood out positively were the refreshing crab and the wagyu beef which was melt-on-your-tongue tender. We were disappointed with the pasta and uni as it was overcooked, which you clearly wouldn't expect at such an exquisite place. The signature dish, abalone, was well presented but I didn't perceive it as excellent as its praise. The rest of the dishes met expectations."

Ta Vie,40,"excellent Japanese fusion, but a bit too pricey","We went for dinner spontaneously and without much expectations. The menu was predefined, so nothing to decide - just sit down and enjoy.  The atmosphere was nice and relaxed and the service good. Each course was explained well. The only thing that took me by surprise was that the first course came more or less with the apéritif.  The food was exquisite. The crab-jelly (first course) and the beef (last main course) were outstanding. The only thing I would change would be to swap the abalone with something else, as I find abalone in general quite uninteresting and chewy. I realise though that this is just personal preference - the dish was prepared well.  All in all, a very nice experience, however on the pricey side, even for fine dining."

Ta Vie,50,"Pure, Simple and Seasonal!","Visited Ta Vie, leaving me a pleasant French-Japanese fine dining experience. 2 stars!  Caesar salad, refresh your palate with crispy lettuce and the Hotaru squid add texture and umami flavour to the dish. It gave a good start to the meal.  Clam chowder, creamy soup. There was a sweetness from the peas that against the salty clam. Wonderful!  Chef special: Sea urchin pasta with seaweed. Strong umami flavour when combined with seaweed. A taste of sea!  Burrata cheese, rich and creamy dish. White strawberry, beetroot and tomato (sweet and sour) are to cut the heaviness from the cheese.  Abalone, it cooked to perfection, top mark for the presentation. Abalone shell I thoughts just a normal shell for decoration but actually is a cookie (eatable). Amazing!  Langoustine, light and simple dish. It just slightly cooked, remain texture in the middle. The broth bring more flavour to the langoustine.  Beef tongue stew, strong earthy flavour from the morel, made the dish full and rich. The beef tongue was so tender.  Both dessert are really good, especially the Almond ice cream covered candy glass (Really appealing). Overall meet my expectation! The taste of the food really impress me."

Ta Vie,50,Ta vie is all class; an exquisite and memorable dining experience.,"Ta vie has a leased space on the second floor of The Pottinger Hotel; it is not difficult to locate if you use the hotel as your guide. The moment you enter the restaurant it exudes class, elegance and serenity. The staff (of many nationalities) efficiently and quietly usher you to your table (booking is essential); quickly take your water order and present menus even though we were experiencing a 9 course set degustation menu; it is always nice to know what you are eating even if it is not patently obvious. Each dish was a work of art, unusual and often quite complicated but all were very tasty. Our menu was based on seafood and we enjoyed scallop, sea urchin, snow crab, fish, abalone and lobster. The wine list was excellent and it was easy to find wines to match the food. Little add ins like the iced Oolong tea to cleanse the palate and the sea urchin dish added to the experience; even the bread and butter were made in house and were excellent. Although the dishes were small and quite exquisite we had plenty to eat. It was quite expensive but you got what you paid for. Being quite a complicated meal the staff were often at the table changing cutlery etc.; they were most unobtrusive. It was a memorable meal."

Ta Vie,50,French with a Japanese twist,"I have been a fan of Chef Hideaki Sato at his previous place. So I thought I have to try his own establishment after I heard about it.    This time, it's no longer traditional Japanese, but rather modern French with some influence from Japanese cuisine. The food was amazing, we all enjoyed very much and the service was superb. Although some could argue that a bit more creativity or character would make the dishes more outstanding.    Other than the wine pairing, there is tea pairing which seems very interesting and great for people who doesn't drink.    Overall I think it's a great place, slightly pricy but justifiable with the ingredients used."

Ta Vie,50,Very delicate dishes,"We went there as a group of five and had a great dinner. The dishes were delicate and good taste. We ordered a bottle of wine with about HKD2500 per head in the end, which I feel a bit on the high side but I would love to bring my wife here for anniversary type of special occasion."

Ta Vie,40,"Good services and good food, can use less expensive ingredient for a different menu selection","I went with my friend to celebrate her special occasion. It is a fixed menu priced at 1,888, a price above average fine dining so I was really looking forward to it. It came with no disappointment. The chef, has fused Japanese ingredients in his French cooking. Taste are carefully planned throughout and we have an enjoyable meal after all. For example, the burrata cheese with fresh tomato is superb; the beef tongue is absoluteIy tender and melt into your mouth! I can also understand why it is priced that way, the ingredients are expensive, including lobster and abalone (one of the chef's signature dish), both are ridiculous expensive nowadays. When thinking about it, inexpensive ingredients can also cook extremely well, there is really no need to consume the more expensive one unless necessary, and the restaurant can design a lower priced course for average consumers. Honestly, if it wasn't a special occasion with my friend we may think twice looking at the price tag. With wine the whole meal cost over 4,500, not something average consumer could afford. Last but not the least, must try the dinner roll, it is so nice that the chef has a half page write up about it ""Yeast meet west""!"

Ta Vie,50,Well worth a try,"Located on the 2nd floor of Pottinger Hotel in Central, it is by far the best choice among the three restaurants the hotel offers. It is staffed with Japanese chef and Japanese waitresses. We had Tasting Menu. In fact, I believe this is the only choice for every guest. Bottled water is from Nagano, Japan. All dishes were meticulously prepared. The chef used fresh, seasonal ingredients which were flavourful. Our dinner experience was very pleasant and enjoyable."

Ta Vie,40,Genius Japanese Chef in Hong Kong,"Ta Vie is definitely one of my finest food experience in the past few months. This time I was here for Valentine's day. The menu indeed is quite pricey but given the quality of the food I don't think I can complain. The menu has been nicely decorated and presented.     First dish: squid tartare with caviar, uni and avocado. The squid itself is a little fishy but mixing everything together you won't notice the fishiness.     Second dish was an oyster with duck consomme and black truffles. This is pretty good and the duck consomme was really tasty.     Third dish: mussels with artichoke salad. The beauty of this dish is that the shell of the mustard is actually made my potato (that black thing) which is quite creative and interesting. Appreciate the effort!    Fourth: a Japanese crab meat risotto. Quite tasty and it's done just right, not too rich.     Fifth: their signature abalone dish. Similar to the mussel dish, the ""shell"" is kind of a handmade pastry. The sauce is quite rich and buttery. Quite good.     Sixth: Blue lobster, very nicely done. The lobster meat is actually quite soft in the middle. The dressing is quite refreshing too!    Seventh: the wagyu smoked with leaf. Wagyu can never go wrong. If you screw up wagyu you're a terrible cook. Certainly not going to happen here.     Dessert was a rose, raspberry and red dragon fruit mix with vanilla sorbet. Very tasty and certainly very Valentine!     Overall a very good experience and the staff were indeed quite detailed while most of them were actually Japanese. Nevertheless I suggest them to work on the interval between different courses as it can be a little inconsistent which caused to wait for some of the courses too be exceptionally long. One could argue it's over priced, and it probably is, but I personally would still come again as most ""artistic"" fine dinning places looks good but doesn't taste good, this place actually has both."

Ta Vie,50,Consistently excellent,"From music and decor to service, everything to enjoy. Food, of course, is the star. Dishes in the 8 course meal are delicate, creative and delicious, mostly seafood and vegetables: very hard to find a favorite. And they are served at a perfect rythm. You can certainly find similar gems elsewhere at a lower price, but for Hong Kong is a very good value."

Ta Vie,50,Excellent choice & Exceptional experience!,"OMG, what an exceptional way of celebrating Christmas' Eve in Ta Vie! Excellent food quality and high standard of service... ambience is awesome too, I love every dish I have, particularly the cheese and beetroot /white strawberry, I wanted to make the reservation for next year already... in fact I should take my parents here for a tasting menu😊... The chef is very young, talented and very friendly, Highly recommended!!"

Ta Vie,50,Really amazing dining experience,Went to this amazing tasting menu with my wife which is located in the Central district. The dishes I really loved here was the Sweet Corn Mousse served with Botan Shrimp.

Ta Vie,30,Average,"I have heard about this restaurant from my friend and eventually I have a try their lunch with my girlfriend, she had regular set lunch and I went for tasting lunch menu, menu price is reasonable but I would like expected more both service and food from a 2 starred Michelin restaurant, it was not a busy lunch service but I have to raise up my hands twice to have my wine refilled, food was average.  I hope they will improve it as I will have a business dinner meeting next month there."

Ta Vie,50,"There are many very good restaurants in Hong Kong, but only one Ta Vie","Ta Vie offers everything you want to for an exceptional dining experience; superb food, superb service and a superb wine list; with very well chosen wines to complement Chef Hideaki Sato beautifully prepared dishes. Ta Vie offers a 8 course fixed menu and occasionally adds another course, if the chef see's something he would like customers to experience that day, The quality of service and the knowledge of the staff is what you would expect from restaurants of the highest quality, as is the interior design of the restaurant itself. One the the very best evenings we have ever had, anywhere in the world; Its not cheap, but then again quality of the highest level seldom is.  Cheers"

Ta Vie,50,Excellent food and service!,"Came here for our wedding anniversary. Service was excellent and staff made my night a memorable one. Set menu was excellent, unique and modern style of cooking and with high quality ingredients. Even Chef Sato came out and wished us happy anniversary!"

Ta Vie,50,Excellent restaurant. One of the best in HK,Amazing food. Each dish is unique with excellent ingredients. The staff is friendly and helpful. Chef Sato even came out at the end of the meal and talked to me. One of the best meals that I had in Hong Kong.

Ta Vie,50,Fine dining and an absolute pleasure,"Modern, stylish, elegant. Service is formal, but not at all austere. You feel welcome, but very special. Chef is highly skilled. Menu is about subtle innovation with the balance of flavours and textures, the best ingredients and attention to detail. Amongst the elite of HK."

Ta Vie,40,Fine tasting for a stylish night out,"This was the second time I've visited this restaurant of chef Hideaki Sato.... and in my opinion he's a genius! This high quality mix of east and west is just.... marvellous!!!    There is only one menu to choose from, but it's all in balance, so no heavy 7 courses....    If you are in HK, visit this gem, and if you have the budget to spare.    It can be chilly inside, so take a coat or sweater, one remark though; on the booking the hostess requested if we had any allergies, and to be fair, I told her I'm very sensitive for lactose; I'm not going to die .... but still...,    Her response was, we can't take that in account, this is the menu.....    I have to say, it's Michelin star restaurant and it was a week in advance....    But I decided to go anyway and I took medicine in advance.... so all worked out, but it is a bit disappointing.....    Enjoy this experience!    DVE"

Ta Vie,50,Perfect match of the East and the West,"My first tea pairing experience starts from here! It is certainly a great pleasure to taste premium tea in wine glasses and have it paired with creative French cuisine prepared with best ingredients from Japan.    Everything is so tasty here! Apart from using very high quality seafood, meat and fruit from Japan, the chef uses different cooking techniques from French, Italian and Chinese kitchen to make the perfect blend of the East and the West. Each dish is an artwork in itself. This is a must-try restaurant."

Ta Vie,50,"Great Produce, Great Flavours and Great Presentation","Nicely appointed restaurant featuring dark colors and wooden features.    Welcoming and pleasant staff attended to all needs and happy to discuss the dishes and food and wine in general.    Some excellent produce was used to create flavorful dishes that were presented nicely, although some were more than nice!    Only 1 dish did not work for me but apart from that everything was good.    The menu changes seasonally so I would be happy to go back and see what's new!"

Ta Vie,50,Birthday Dinner,"Ta Vie is one of the best service restaurant that I have experienced. Though the restaurant is not really big but the environment and atmosphere is nice and comfort. Their home made bread and butter is so nice and fresh, their recommended wine is amazing, follow by the cold soup feels like swimming in the sea, refreshing and relaxing, the main dish is perfect, what surprised us is the birthday cake, is a season melon with the cake inside, you can tell that the Chef have put so much effort on the food, the staffs are gorgeous, thx for their excellent service and food 👍"

Ta Vie,10,Unexpectedly appalling experience,"It was my first time visiting Ta Vie and I was so looking forward to it given its reputation and its michelin-2 stars rating. My parents are also regulars there.    When I first sat down, I have specified and stressed to the servers there that I cannot consume any raw food due to my health concerns. The waitress was very helpful explaining how the food can be served in a well-cooked way after checking with the chef. However, it was a complete shock to me when the following incidents happened:    1. I was told all the dishes/ food can be served well-cooked. However, mid-way while I was eating the Caesar salad, the texture of the dressing reminded me that it might have raw egg in it. I quickly inquired with the waitress and was completely shocked to find out that she had to ask the chef again and THERE WAS RAW EGG IN THE DRESSING. This is certainly not what I expected from a Michelin-2 star rated restaurant where chefs and servers are not well communicated on what kind of ingredients are being used in the dishes and food being served. This incident can cause detrimental effect to my health and this is absolutely unacceptable coming from such a highly rated restaurant with staff having no concerns at all to their patrons. There were no sincere apology and compensation either.    2. We have requested another round of round white bread rolls but the waiter has served us another kind of sliced rye square bread. When we asked the waiter why it was not the round bread rolls which we had earlier, he explained that it was the same type of bread roll but just cut differently. Without mentioning the texture of the bread, anyone with proper eye sight can tell even the colors of the 2 breads are different. It is truly unbelievable that a staff from a Micheline 2 star rated restaurant is such poorly trained even with such basic bread knowledge (note that bread is even served before the first dish and this already gave us such a bad impression from the beginning of our dining experience), which left us all in complete shock and huge disappointment.    I don't think I need to stress again how appaling this whole dining experience was and there is definitely no coming-back, no referrals and only unpleasant comments from me on this restaurant."

Ishikawa,50,Delicious food,Amazing food and service. Delicate flavour and beautiful presentation. Chef also packed left over rice for us and made it into rice ball. Definitely worth 3 star Michelin.

Ishikawa,50,Excellent Kaiseki and good service,"This restaurant has 7 counter seats and several private rooms. The seating is comfortable and owner Chef Ishikawa served one or two dishes. The food is Kaiseki style. The Chef put his soul into the cooking. He used fresh local ingredients in season. Even a small piece of bamboo shoot and cucumber would be the freshest possible. We have lobster, clam, glass shrimps, uni blow fish milt soup, seabass, hairy crab, wagyu beef and every dish was superbly designed and executed. It is the best restaurant I have been to in japan. The price is reasonable for its food quality, Yen 29,000 plus 18pc tax and service charge per person."

Ishikawa,20,"Hey Michelin, why 3 stars?","Three stars should be reserved for exceptional service, ambiance and food. The service staff is friendly, efficient and everything that anyone could want. The space is serene and beautiful, and we had a nice little private room that seated up to 4 (we were only 2), but the atmosphere was spoiled by a very loud party that shouted what sounded like a drinking cheer every 5 minutes. The food was fine, but just fine, and even though a couple of dishes were delicious, none of it was close to exceptional. (And that’s ignoring the one item that we chose not to eat. It was blowfish milt. Google it, you wouldn’t eat it either.) The meal was presented in superb fashion, and we were done is about two hours, but it wasn’t wonderful. And the cost cannot be justified for anything less than exceptional (dinner was US$750 plus $200 for wine and mineral water). Regrettably, I would pass on this one, we won’t be back."

Ishikawa,20,A big letdown,"After dining the previous night at the exhilarating Narisawa expectations were high for Ishikawa. And we couldn’t be more disappointed.    First, we booked our reservation through a booking service called Tableall. Big mistake. You identify yourself as a foreigner/tourist and be prepared to be treated accordingly. We were led to a private room which completely defeated the feeling of being in the middle of the action. You MUST request to be at the counter otherwise not worth going.    Then the food. Very mediocre and nothing at all memorable. The highlight of the night was Mr Ishikawa coming into our room for 5 minutes to serve us rice and the kind way they said goodbye. Be smart and try somewhere else."

Ishikawa,50,Just fantastic!,"Traditional Japanese cuisine. Extraordinary Food and service. High quality and diversity of products. I liked black throat sea perch with bamboo shoots, flatfish with sea urchin and thinly sliced Japanese beef with turnip covered with sticky sauce. Just fantastic! It’s hard to find the entrance. Absolutely racomanded!"

Ishikawa,30,Great staff but disappointing food,"I will start with the good part. The staff was exceptional and as nice as can be. Our cab driver couldn’t find it so called the restaurant and two of the staff came out to meet us on the corner so we wouldn’t get lost. The service was perfect and flawless. Unfortunately that was the best part of the experience. With the 3 stars we were expecting an amazing meal but what we got was fairly mediocre at best. The food was presented well but only one or two of the dishes were good, a couple were terrible and the rest were okay at best. If this had been our first Kaiseki dinner I would have thought maybe that kind of food wasn’t for us, but luckily we had a few others before that were excellent so we knew it wasn’t us. It was also quite expensive. We were in a private room which felt very subdued and there was a very loud group in the room next door which was annoying but if the food had been good we would not have minded. Anyway I am sorry to have to post a negative review because I really wanted to like it but all I can say is it was not very good."

Ishikawa,50,Extraordinary,"This is some something extraordinary. Food and service is just fantastic. Simple as that. It’s more than a restaurant, is a memory for life, hard to find the entrance, sex seats in front of the chef and the rest is history. Absolutely brilliant!"

Ishikawa,50,Fantastic spring dinner,"Towards the end of our spring trip, we were back at Ishikawa. We had a booking for around 9pm, second seating. This time they called at 730pm to say our table was available. Got there after 8pm and began a wonderful 9 course kaiseki. Highlight of the dinner was monkfish liver with egg yoke sauce with firefly squid, black throat sea perch with bamboo shoots, flatfish with sea urchin from two different regions and thinly sliced Japanese beef with turnip covered with sticky sauce. Pics of most of the dishes attached. Accompanied with three rounds of cold sake. Feels like heaven."

Ishikawa,50,"All the dishes of ""Ishikawa"" are really great.","All the dishes of ""Ishikawa"" are really great.  There are many fine Japanese restaurants in the Japan, but there are few opportunities to meet these great dishes.  All of the dishes are simply refined, deep and delicate.  There are a lot of dishes finished up to 90%, but if you want to meet a 100% tasting dish, there is no better restaurant than ""Ishikawa"".  Mr. Ishikawa says that he will repeat the prototype dozens of times until the finished image of the dish.  He continues his genius and constant efforts in cooking.  The great thing about this place is that a number of young members are coming up.  Mr. Ishikawa says a joke, but seems to be an Oriental philosopher who pursues the truth.    Reservations are difficult, but don't miss out if you have the opportunity."

Ishikawa,40,"Good, but not as excellent as Kohaku","Since I love Kohaku (their sister restaurant in Kagurazaka - the Chef of Kohaku was trained at Ishikawa) I was so looking forward to my dinner at Ishikawa.  Unfortunately I was not that impressed.  I could totally eat same quality food in Azabu and Ginza area with perhaps less money.  The service was excellent - but the food was nothing exceptional nor exciting. Maybe I'll give them one more shot, but if I could get a reservation at Kohaku, I would choose Kohaku with no second thought."

Ishikawa,50,Consistently excellent,"We have been to Ishikawa on average about once a year for the past five years. This time was an extension of my birthday celebrations. It was a Monday night and the second booking slots from 9pm were also full. Chef Ishikawa doesn't seem to age, full of humour and great passion to create the best dishes for his guests. You can tell he has a great following. We had a fantastic kaiseki dinner as expected. We don't particularly fancy milt dishes (though in season in winter months) but his blowfish milt dish was good. Book early to avoid disappointment."

Ishikawa,50,Five star Experience !,"This adorable place is tucked behind a temple in a residential area far far away from the tourist belt but well worth searching for as the total experience was awesome! The Chef and his staff were outstanding in their service and attention to details. The food was delightfully done with the freshest ingredients. I really enjoyed the snow crab covered with broth jelly, silver pomfret with ginkgo nuts, flatfish and fresh sea urchin , abalone sashimi , barracuda sushi, Japanese beef, rice and porridge combo and the dessert of grapes on black tea jelly floating on brandy soup. This three Michelin star place is very different from what I experienced in London and will appeal very much to those whose palate enjoy the delicate Japanese cuisine."

Ishikawa,20,Disappointed wi,"We visited this highly rated restaurant, while on the trip to Japan. It took two weeks to secure the reservations and we were excited to try it. We were seated in the private room for 4. The staff was nice, however I expected a lot more from food. Even though, everything was fresh, the combination and the menu was disappointing."

Ishikawa,50,A perfect meal.,"I visited my daughter who lives in Tokyo. I wanted an exceptional dinner to celebrate, and this was it. This subtle, quiet, but magnificent restaurant made this very anticipated experience the cornerstone of my trip. No need to say more."

Ishikawa,50,"Amazing service, great food","Had the best rice dish - so simple, clean but cooked to perfection. I grew up eating rice but didn't realize a vegetarian rice dish could be so sublime. I was so full after that 10+ course meal and sad about not being able to finish that dish. As I walked out of the door, the chef followed me out and handed me a bag with rice balls made with the leftover! Speaking about truly amazing service, that was pretty much it.    Do they serve the best course meal ever? No, there are other Michelin restaurants that serve tastier food. But the price was reasonable for the 3 Michelin start pedigree and some of dishes were truly delicious. They also had a great sake selection not overpriced. Totally worth putting some efforts to get a reservation."

Ishikawa,50,Fantastic Kaiseki food,This restaurant is what should come to your mind when you think of culinary excellence. I have never experienced such impeccable service and doubt any restaurant could mesmerize me the way Ishikawa did during my stay in Tokyo.

Ishikawa,40,Very good kaiseki meal albeit no Wow factor,Had a very good kaiseki meal here with excellent seafood and friendly service albeit it was a bit hurried for me. The staff spoke English very well. Food was mostly enjoyable but felt that there was no Wow dish for me that truly sings.

Ishikawa,50,perfect,"this was our second visit to ishikawa and we loved it again. the food is amazing and the chef, his wife and the other chefs are so welcoming. we will back soon."

Ishikawa,50,Michelin 3-star,No wonder this is a 3-star restaurant. Food is excellent with creativity. I would definitely give it a perfect rating if you are looking for good food and service.

Ishikawa,50,Amazing Dining Experience at Ishikawa,"My friend made reservations for me four weeks in advance, for a Tuesday night in June at 8:30pm. We were greeted by Akame, who was dressed in a kimono. She walked us to a private room. In the reviews, I had read about the private rooms, so this was expected. She gives me the dinner menu and we each get a hot towel. We order water and hot matcha green tea. Our 9 course meal is pre-set at 22,000 yen ($210 USD) per person. We have:  Appetizer - Hard Clam and Garland Chrysanthemum Covered with Broth Jelly. This was so flavorful with interesting layers.  Deep Fried Baby Ayu Fish with Japanese Pepper Bud Sauce.  Soup - Soft-shelled Turtle and Julienne Vegetables with a hint of Yuzu Citrus – really interesting flavors  Sashimi - sole Fish anf Fresh Sea Urchin Garnished with Fresh Seaweed and Japanese Herbs. Sea urchin from North Japan. Sea urchin from South Japan is on the white plate.  Sashimi part 2 - Lightly seared Squid. A beautiful piece of art  Our waitress Akemi, dressed in kimono, gave us excellent service. She took our water glasses, wiped the frost off them, refilled them, and gave us new coasters with the Ishikawa logo. And gave us new matcha tea cups.  Sashimi part 3 - Steamed Abalone with Abalone Stock Jelly. This was one of our favorites!  Charcoaled-grilled Cutlass Fish and Lotus Root. The fish melted in our mouths, and I loved the crunchy lotus root  Delicacy - Swimming Crab and Eggplant from Kyoto Covered in Sticky Sauce. The crab was so flavorful!  More matcha green tea replacement and cleaning of our water glasses.  Hot Pot - Thinly sliced Wagyu Beef and Season Vegetables.  Miso Soup and Pickled Vegetables.  Then, Chef Hidek Ishikawa came in to our dining room and served us Steamed Rce and Conger Eel, whch was delcious! He asked us where we were from, if ths was our frst visit to Japan. He was very humble and kind.  We are brought toothpicks, and brown tea.  Dessert - Fresh Melon, Molasses Agar and Crushed Rum Jelly Floating on Cream Cheese Soup.  With more matcha green tea.  OMG! This was an amazing dessert! Even though we were full, we gobbled it all up!  We had an amazng dining experence that we wll never forget. Chef Ishikawa with a waitress both walked us outside on the street and greeted us good-bye! They even gave us nigiri rice balls to go!  Total was 78,400 ($743 USD) for the three of us, and well worth the dining experience!"

Ishikawa,10,Disaster from start to finish. Currently avoid at all costs.,"Before writing this review I was one of Ishikawa's biggest fans, so as someone who knows how everything has deteriorated I am well fit to write this review.    1. After booking these seats 2 months in advance, I arrived with my colleague to the restaurant and was seated in a ""private room"" which is 3 meters by 3 meters by 2 meters in height, and resembles more a prison cell than anything.    I have been to Ishikawa 3 times before, always seated at the bar in front of him. THIS is what one usually expects. To interact, and be served directly by the chef. Not to be stuck in a prison cell. They made no mention of this ""private room"" before arrival. So I highly recommend if you are still convinced you want to eat here, to at least make sure you don't get set up in that horrible room and explicitly ask to be seated at the bar.    Moving on to the food now... It was a true disaster as well. I wish I had better things to say but I don't.    The previous times I dined at his place it was true heaven. This time it was horrible.    (June menu)  The hard clam appetizer should be removed from the menu.    This is followed by baby ayu fish which is deep fried. This should also be removed from the menu as the upper part of the fish (head, etc, yes this is eaten whole) tastes very bitter and is unpleasant.    This is followed by the worst dish in his June menu, the soft-shell turtle soup. There was no way to tell which part of soup was the turtle, the vegetables were completely raw and very chewy, the turtle was sliced paper thin and didn't have any flavor.    Next is the Sole fish sashimi (hirame). It should not be on his menu either. The Hirame is extremely chewy and has no flavor. People do not appreciate this fish, and I sure as hell didn't. He could have gone with something more classic like o-toro or chu-toro.    After this came the seared squid which was ok. Nothing special here, carry on...    Grilled cutlas fish was next, it was nice to feel the warm fish cooked just right with the smoky flavors from the coal.    Following the grilled fish was Crab (and its roe) with eggplant from hokkaido. This was nice, but didn't make me jump out of my chair.    After this was the shabu-shabu thinly sliced wagyu beef. The beef was not what one would expect to have at a 3-star michelin restaurant. I would get rid of this shabu-shabu gimmick and instead serve charcoal grilled pieces of excellent wagyu. Classic, safe but if done right is extremely pleasant.    The last dish before desert was his classic steamed rice with fish, that was nice, nothing to complain about. very classic.    Lastly, and most surprisingly was the desert. Fresh melon (which was perfectly ripe and exploded in my mouth), molasses of agar (truly insane flavors) and liquid cream cheese (unbelievable). The desert was mind-boggling. If I had one complaint about it is the Rum gelatin that he put on top, it destroyed it but I simply moved it aside and ate the rest which was heaven. Alcohol has absolutely no purpose in this desert. Chef, if you are reading this PLEASE remove the rum from your jelly.    To wrap it up, if I was michelin I would strip him of 2 of his 3 stars based on this experience alone.    Guys, this is not coming from a hater, I am a lover of Ishikawa which is why I wouldn't strip him of all of his 3 stars. He needs to get his act together and get back to how good he used to be.    And for god's sake PLEASE NEVER PUT SOMEONE IN YOUR 'PRIVATE ROOM' AGAIN!! At least not without telling them first.    If you are reading this review and are planning to eat at ishikawa, for the time being I highly recommend you keep your money (because it's not cheap) and book somewhere else like Kanda (very similar to ishikawa, also 3 stars, but still on point)    Last note, chef ishikawa is a doll. Truly a great person and great personality, but I have to judge the restaurant, its food, and service unfortunately, not the chef's kindness."

Ishikawa,50,How to stay at the very top ?,"First tick - Arrival : The restaurant is located in a nice district inside a single storey house designed with a touch of modern Japanese flair. Upon arrival , you are welcome by a staff speaking in english. When seated, you are immediately handed over with an English Menu printed with your name - another tick. The food containers are beautiful and refined. Food is artfully displayed with sufficient aroma and top notch freshness. The staff with restricted English are sufficiently expressively and entertaining. The food portions are generous and the pricing is reasonably when compared to some other more average restaurants. When leaving, the team of staff see you off with a small gift of onigiri . How can one not feeling satisfied with such all rounded top level standard.    Great location, good food, high standard staffs! It's a place to go back during my next visit in January."

Ishikawa,50,The best,We visited a number of restaurants while in Tokyo. Ishikawa was the best. Very expensive though. AUS$1200 for three people. The menu was a set menu. Every dish was extremely good.  The service was very timely and our hostess could speak good English. A very good night.

Ishikawa,50,"Superb, oi shi, tres bien","This is Tokyo best dining spot in my humble opinion. Staffs speaks good English and menu is in English ( changes he made over the last 2 years)    I have eaten twice over 2 years apart n the food quality, presentation, creativity, and Chef humble attitude towards all his customers makes it the best dining spot.    Come hungry as you will be fill by the end of the dinner course with fresh seasonal selection. Restaurant only serves 1 dinner set course.    The Chef is very Creative and that shows in his simple but Super tasty rice balls (rice with trout) when guests can't finish, he allows them to take away only for his rice. It was hanami weekend and Chef gave us 3 rice balls for our picnic basket, the taste was still very delicious even after 2 days later.    I will make this place my regular visit when in town."

Ishikawa,50,Best Sushi In The World,"Ishikawa served the best sushi and Japanese food that I've ever had; in my opinion, even better than Jiro. This is some of, if not *the* best sushi in the world. Perfect relaxing atmosphere, beautiful interior, attentive staff, and simply perfect sushi. Literal perfection. The freshest, tastiest fish, fantastic sushi rice and seasoning. Tastes beyond what I even thought possible. This restaurant single handily raised the bar and changed my view of what I thought possible with sushi and Japanese cuisine in general. Well priced. The 3 michelin stars are well deserved. You simply must eat here if you have the opportunity, it is life changing.    A must visit for anyone in Tokyo."

Ishikawa,50,Outstanding,"Our second visit to Ishikawa. This visit we sat at the sushi counter instead of the private room. It was a more interactive experience with the Chef. The private room is also good if you want a quieter more formal dining experience with service from one of their excellent traditionally attired female serving staff.    Every dish on the menu was simply presented but had a depth of flavour that was amazing. Our favourites were the deep fried silver pomfret with chiso leaf and lotus root, charcoal grilled conger eel and taro, the simmered wagyu beef with seasonal vegetables and the steamed freshly harvested rice served with sea bream paste and pickled vegetables.    A surprise at the end of our dinner - a beautiful strawberry cake as we are celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. We didn't let the restaurant know in advance - this was disclosed only during some lively chit chat with fellow diners at the counter.    A definite recommendation and we will certainly be back on our next trip to Tokyo."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Epic Sushi Chef,"I never thought I’d say this but this was the best Sushi meal that I’ve ever had. Chef Yoshitake San was in his element. He is in command of the room. A counter for 8. His presence is felt and observed. His attention to detail is flawless. It’s theatre at its best. People were in awe. My son who is a foodie and knows more than I do about Japanese food thought it was epic… Every sushi dish was 10 out of 10. The squid, tuna and Uni were 11 out of 10! It deserves the 3 Michelin stars. The service was perfect. The Tamago maybe could have been a touch better for a 3 star, we had a dry end cut but this did not in any way dampen our enthusiasm and appreciation of a great meal. Thank you Yoshitake San and well done…"

Sushi Yoshitake,40,Very good but!,"Is it good ? Yes it is the products are super fresh Nicely presented with some innovation ,but! I am maybe too picky but I was expecting more innovation or surprises. , the service is good but not of a 3 * Michelin restaurant, My favorite dish was the Uni , absolutely fantastic One stupid point in my opinion you can not take pictures of the dishes ! Why?"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Deserves the 3 Michelin star,"3 michelin star 10 seater counter sushi place that needs a reservation. Some of my favorites here include Uni from Miyagi prefecture with corn pudding, fresh Takobutsu, and the Hairy Crab on Wintermelon puree."

Sushi Yoshitake,10,Don't go if you're at the 2nd sushi bar,Sushi Yoshitake was a huge disappointment. I first visited in June of 2015 and had the best meal of my life. In July 2019 I went again and was stuck at the second bar with a junior sushi chef without my consent. The quality was much lower - not much better than places in Seattle. The sushi rice fell apart and the fish was too cold. It was a waste of money.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Once in a lifetime,We are talking about the best of the very best in a city like Tokyo where food is done well pretty much every where.    3 michelin stars and only 11 seats (7 + 4 in a separate room). we had the pleasure to be in the smaller one and be served by Yoshitake senior sous chef.    Someone might thinks that was ' only sushi ' but definately was not!    25 courses including some traditional japanese dishes and of course plenty of suhi and sahimi    Negative: the entrance is litterally in a office building not very appealing/clean

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Wonderful Sushi Restaurant,"We were fortunate to be able to dine at this wonderful restaurant. The sushi was amazing and the chef was a true gentleman. We speak no Japanese, but they did their best to communicate. The quality of our food was amazing and it was a memorable meal. We were at Sukiyabashi Jiro the night before. The food was equally good, but the experience was more relaxed and enjoyable. We were very thankful to the Tokyo Station Hotel for getting us this reservation."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Excellent food. Excellent Chef. Excellent service.,Food was outstanding with excellent preparation. Highly recommended. Our private tour guide recommended this longstanding restaurant in the heart of Tokyo.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,nice,after visiting sushi shikon in hong kong we were happy to be able to dine at sushi yoshitake. the high expectations were fulfilled and the evening was funny in the end as some guests and the chef were smart entertainers. beautiful new location.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Lived up to expectations,"For those who wonder whether 3 michelin star sushi is significantly better than one or two star sushi, this is purely subjective and one that I cannot answer. I have eaten at a number of two star sushi restaurants in Tokyo and Yoshitake is certainly better than most of them and just as enjoyable as Sushi Sawada. Stand out dishes were Abalone with liver sauce and Tamago - definitely the best examples that I have tried. The seasoning of the rice was truly outstanding and the entire experience was enjoyable, from start to finish.    If you can get a reservation, I can whole heartedly recommend it. It would certainly help if you could have a Japanese speaker with you (which I did), but not essential."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Wondrous sushi omakase,"First of all, I apologise for not showing pictures because the chef did not allow us to take pictures of the food. However, the experience was wondrous. The food was perfect. The abalone with liver sauce, uni sushi, tuna sushi, charcoal grilled eel and grilled rock fish were the highlight of our course. The miso soup at the end was also nice with a yuzu scent. Overall, the chef took care of us very well. Great night."

Sushi Yoshitake,30,Excellent food but our experience was tarnished by chef's treatment of us,"On our recent vacation to Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, Kanazawa, and Matsumoto, we had the opportunity to try many different restaurants. First, as a recent reviewer mentioned below, taxis might struggle finding this place. The Conrad ""made sure"" the taxi driver knew where we were going, but the taxi driver still struggled. Then he just dropped us off without really telling us where the restaurant was. We asked some people on the street, and they searched it on their phones, but unfortunately they sent us walking 10 minutes in the wrong direction. Instead of being a few minutes early, we were 20 minutes late. Obviously, it's our fault. We apologized profusely, the best we could in English since we didn't speak Japanese. But the Chef really wasn't interested in our apologies. Again, we know it was ""our fault"". So we missed a few of the courses. No problem. But for the remainder of the night, we were served mostly by his assistant. And if he did serve us on occasion, he wasn't very friendly. We could only say sorry, and oishi so many times. But it seemed to do no good. Which then of course ruined our entire dining experience when it's such an intimate room (there were 8 diners that night). The Chef also retaliated and wouldn't let me take pictures. Again, since I've seen videos of meals and pictures posted online by many diners, it was disappointing he would ""punish"" us for being late. Yes, we enjoyed trying all the different food. We are quite adventurous eaters. But the dining experience was ruined because we were late. Shout out to Mieko at the Conrad Tokyo for getting us reservations here ad at Ryugin and Ginza Hirayama, just to name a few). We had to apologize to her and have her call to explain to the restaurant why we were late. We didn't want to damage her and the Conrad's reputation with the restaurant. But honestly, if it's more about the Chef than anything else, well... it's hard to recommend the place. So...we would never go back. But... we wouldn't blame you for wanting to trying it if you've never tried it! Hence the 3 star rating. Just don't be late! You might end up getting punished for it the entire meal and having a terrible time!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Well... perfect,"The kind of experience that you live once in your life. You have to go through the difficulty to get a seat in a seven seatings restaurant which offers only 2 services, then find the place (the taxi struggled) and then you are in sushi heaven.  The absolute perfection, a sublime journey."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The very best of Sushi,"Our guide is surprised how we could get a booking at the Chef Table. Well, A Very Big ""Thank You"" to Peninsula Hotel for make this exceptional culinary experience possible.    We were there 15 minutes before our appointed time. Be on time not earlier or later. There is no waiting area, so we need to explore the surrounding area until the appointed time.    That night, only 7 diners.    Chef Masahiro Yoshitake is quite friendly. He can only speaks very simple English.    Warning, do not place your mobile phone on the table and no Video. Photo is ok.    No menu, just Omakase but we were provide with simple list in english of what to expect that night.    Its always enjoy watching the chef preparing your food and hand it to you immediately he finished preparing it.    The food, is undoubtedly, fresh and delicious. I was too engrossed in the food to take much photos. Observing the skills in preparations, the knife skills in slicing, the mastery in making the sushi makes the dinner more enjoyable. It will be better if I could understand and speaks Japanese to converse with the chef.    A must do if you have the opportunity. Book months ahead.    Highly recommend it."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Wow. Loved it.,"We had dinner at Yoshitake on our second night in Tokyo while staying at the Prince Gallery. It was sublime. Despite the chef and his team speaking little English, they still made attempts to communicate, even using Google translate. Everyone was super friendly and even a few of the other Japanese patrons (we were the only Anglos) engaged us a bit.    The food was spectacular. Some of the best sushi we've ever had, including some that I normally despise. I ate a raw oyster for the first time in almost 35 years--and loved it. I usually despise oysters in any form. I wanted more, it was so good. Even the uni was delicious, and I normally despise that. Everything was beautifully presented and spectacularly good. Oi-shi, indeed! Su-goi, too!    We highly recommend Yoshitake if you can get the booking. Don't ask--just go. This was one of our 4 most memorable meals in Japan--which is saying something, as we had a total of 21 Michelin stars in our 2 weeks! Our other faves included Narisawa in Tokyo, Kitcho in Kyoto, and the food/presentation (but not the service) at Hajime in Osaka."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The best sushi place on this planet,"Continuing to win six Michelin stars, the master sushi chef Mr Yoshitake is a legendary! So many appetizers makes one so happy. Better to book thru hotel concierge. Definitely the best is Ginza, Tokyo, Japan and this planet!! ミシュラン6つ星シェフの吉武さんの寿司は芸術の域を越えてます。握り前に頂く品々でノックダウン。最高の職人技に誰もが満足することでしょう。"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best Sushi I've ever had in my life,"After a friend got us a reservation which you have to do long in advance, we were in for a treat.  The whole experience was nothing short of amazing and all the details were thought of. Service was great on all fronts and Yoshitake is a true culinary wizard. Not cheap but worth the expense"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Do not miss this place,"If you want a super special sushi, don’t miss Yoshitake. The menu is exquisite, the service is fantastic and the food does not require a review. I would go back a thousand times!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,"Wow, just spectacular","This restaurant is in a very nondescript building in one of the backstreets off the main Ginza strip. It wasn't hard to find but do your research before hand. This is a 7 seater restaurant so take note there is a cancellation policy. It wasn't easy getting a reservation for this place as they only open up reservations at the certain time and it gets booked out quickly. I was lucky and got my reservation via my hotel concierge 2 months before my trip.  Master Yoshitake-san was very friendly. I was the only non-Japanese speaker in that sitting and he took time to explain everything he was serving to me in English.  The meal started of with some cooked appetizers and sashimi. I have to say they were incredible. From the monkfish liver to the bonito in a bonito broth to octopus. The stand out for me was the abalone in an abalone liver sauce. It was bursting with flavour and the sauce was deliciously decadent and creamy.  There were quite a lot of courses (8) served before the sushi course began. And then a total of 14 pieces of sushi were served. It was an extremely filling dinner, and I was very full at the end which is unusual for me.  As for the sushi, Master Yoshitake uses a red vinegar in his shari apparently, which gives it a brownish tint. His shari was mild and perfectly complimented the fish. Every single piece I had was spectacular, but my favourites were the lightly smoked yellowtail, of course the chutoro and otoro, the 2 types of uni, the kuruma-ebi and the anago.  The meal was just fantastic. i think this will be my go to splurge restaurant in Tokyo now (if I can get a reservation that is!). Just outstanding."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,We had an amazing time - delicious sushi and great ambiance!,"Nestled amongst the buildings at the back of Ginza, we finally pin-pointed the correct building and made our way up in the lift. We opened the sliding door and was met by the maitre-d in western bow tie, black vest and pants. He verified our names and asked us to wait a bit as we were early.    Within a couple of minutes, we were ushered in. The head chef greeted us and his team looked up from their work and also greeted us warmly. We felt most welcomed. This small, Michelin star restaurant has 7 counter seats only. Booking is essential. We did this via our hotel about a month in advance. Bookings need to be made for the next month, preferably at the beginning of the month before. Our hotel did the booking for us at the beginning of August to dine in September. So far, we noted that Peninsula Tokyo and Palace Hotel have been able to secure bookings at these hard to get restaurants.    I ordered sake and it was recommended that we move from the first carafe at the top of the sake menu to the next, as the meal progresses. We enjoyed the sake very much and ended up consuming 3 carafes [180ml each]    The meal is ""omakase"" [translated to ""as the chef pleases'] with lots of preparation that goes into the meal. A small paper menu in English is laid up on the table for us to follow the meal course. The left side was mostly sashimi-style with some type of accompaniment. Example - the freshly grilled eel was accompanied by edamame soup with dollop of caviar.    This lot of courses showcased the depth of talent at Yoshitake. Much of the flavours of the fish were well paired with other preparations made by the chefs. The chefs worked very well together and you can tell that they enjoyed their tasks.    The head chef was ably assisted by a younger assistant and he helped grate the wasabi, chop the fish, prepare the fish for smoking, and heated up the seaweed for the final Temaki handroll, amongst other things. There's a chef team in the kitchen, prepping or cooking the food. They all integrated well as a team and it was really nice to see such a well-oiled machine.    The sushi course started after the team sliced the respective fish variety, bathed it in soya sauce or further preparations. Once half the sushi course were lined up in a Parade Square manner, the chef-owner dipped his hands in cold water and started to prepare the sushi and deliver it to his patrons. He was always careful to deliver the tasty morsels from left to right, then from right to left; with each patron or family given a chance to receive their sushi first.    The head-chef was talkative and interacted well with two Japanese ladies. He also talked to the other couple and us three. He also gently chided my son for slouching half on the table and half against the corner, telling him he had to sit up straight for receive his sashimi. When my wife and I started an animated conversation about the peeling process of the prawns, he laughed and asked us what was happening.    We had a vey pleasant dining experience. Our dinner booking was for 8.30pm, and we did not end till 10.15pm. We hung around a little more before saying our thanks in Japanese and moving off. The meal here was more reasonable than our previous Michelin star Sushi meal - with more courses and more sake.    This is a certainly a great sushi practitioner and well worth the Michelin star. Ee certainly enjoyed ourselves with such amazing food and such warm company. We will return another day!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The Very Authentic and Interesting Experience,"This is a very small restaurant but the attention to detail and the way the whole experience is delivered was a one off experience. While you will get a very personal experience in other places, SY takes it to a whole different level. Every mouthful is skillfully constructed.    It mist be noted that if you're out for a relaxed night out that this is not the place. This is about an intense food focused experience."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The best Sushi experience ever..,"I been here invite by a japanese colleague,otherwise apparently is not easy to dine here,  The restaurant is open only in dinner time, and is always full, you have 2hours for enjoy your dinner, they not give you a menu a la carte but is fix from the chef, that is preparing in front of you and is just amazing and also what I loved is the commune table we was sitting 7 peoples on the counter and most of us not know each others.. in the end of the dinner you have new friends.."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Worth every penny,"Had Visa Concierge help make the reservation and is still one of the few restaurants that allow for a 3rd party to make reservations for you. Some hotels wont even help make the reservation while some of the sushi restaurants only will take hotel concierge reservations. A month before heading out to Japan, our chances to get into a nice sushi restaurant seemed very slim but Visa Concierge came through for 4 people at 8:30pm in the private room. The food was local. The flavors were amazing. The Chef himself, was cheerful and spoke English very well. He made us laugh and feel comfortable. We had 3 carafes of sake and it came out to a total of 325 per person. Would I do it again? yes. Was it worth it? yes."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,What a Treat!,"We really enjoyed our evening at Sushi Yoshitake. There are only seven counter seats and Chef Yoshitake presides. There are almost as many staff who keep drinks filled and help prepare the tasting menu. The dinner takes about two hours for you to eat and enjoy each morsel. The staff were very friendly and spoke English. We felt very welcomed, almost as if we were in Chef's home. This is a very expensive night out but if you can go for it we recommend it. We have been to many Michelin starred restaurants throughout the world and this was yet another unique and very special evening to be remembered."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The gem of Tokyo. One of the best I ever have.,"Late review of Sushi Yoshitake. Chef Yoshitake is one of the top Sushi chefs that stands at the pinnacle of the art together with Jiro and Saito. The restaurant is located at a inconspicuous building which took me awhile to find. In short, a middle age lady suddenly approached and asked me whether I am looking for Sushi Yoshitake. At the restaurant, Chef Yoshitake was very friendly and warm throughout and the service of other staff was impeccable. Every slice of sushi and sashimi was made with the freshest fish. So fresh and sweet that it made all other sushi and sashimi I ever had, except Shinji and Shoukouwa, an insult to what sushi and sashimi should be. All the sashimi simply melted in my mouth. The assortment sushi and sashimi carried various taste to the max: fresh, mild, rich, buttery, firm, subtle, sweet, and brine. Few dishes stood up among the rest of the treasure. Steamed abalone with abalone liver sauce. The creamy, deep and a combination of egg plus foie gras taste. The option to have the remaining of the sauce with top grade Japanese rice was simply marvelous. The sea urchin, fatty tuna and unagi sushi caught my attention as well. The rich, buttery, and briny taste of the sea urchin was so delicious that it reminisces the ocean. I lost words with the fatty tuna and unagi sushi. The fatty tuna and unagi evaporated once they reached your mouth. Minimum chewing effort was required as they slide down my throat. Fat, creamy, and rich coupled with the perfect sushi skills. Now I can no longer go back to ordinary sushi. Next time in Japan, I will definitely try Jiro and Saito. For now, only Shinji and Shoukouwa can satisfy my palate. Not forgetting to mention, Chef Yoshitake was warm and professional enough to greet each and every customer when they leave and I managed to take pictures with him."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Very disappointing -not worth it anymore,"Pity as it used to be a regular for us coming to Paris for many years since it opened. Food was mostly bland, & for what it was it was overpriced. When we queried a dish our waiter didn't want to acknowledge it & was even more rude than before.    There are much places to go in Paris."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Worth the price for a special occasion,Before his premature death Joel Robuchon created this formula for his restaurants that rightly thrive around the world’s global cities. You typically sit at the serving counters - there are separate settings for groups of more than two - where the staff present a very expensive degustation menu or items from an a la carte one. Go for the second if you are confident of what you know and like.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Asked to tip at a Michelin star restaurant,"The food was simply incredible.    After an incredible meal with some cool people, from all around the world, and one great French actor.    As I finish my espresso, and I was getting ready to pay, a Michelin, star employee, female, asked me, if I wanted to give them a tip?    I think, for a Michelin star restaurant employee to asked a patron, if they want to give a tip is the most despicable thing I have ever experienced!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Rude front door staff ruin experience.,"This has been an excellent restaurant for 20 years. The wait staff is very friendly. Unfortunately the front door staff is perpetually atrocious. It’s unfortunate that they carry the rude Parisian wait staff rule and extend it. Vincent is the primary offender. What would otherwise be a delightful dining experience is marred by their dreadful evening managers, and door managers. Shame. Therefore not Michelin quality."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,A must try in Paris,Amazing experience !! From service to quality of food and price point !!! We’ll be back ! Our hostess at the counter was knowledgeable and spoke 3 languages !! He really made a difference when explaining each dish as they were coming !!

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Outstanding!,"Outstanding tasting menu and service, enjoyed atmosphere, which encouraged interaction with Chef's as well as other patrols."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Would skip this one,"Visited with my family for what I expected to be a nice meal in Paris. Ambiance and service are both severely lacking. I am not want to normally write reviews, but save your time and pass on this restaurant. The food is actually decent, but the waiters practically throw the food at you, I get better service at my local diner back home. Skip this one while in Paris."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,10,Terrible receptionist and maneger do not go,We had a reservation for 9PM. We waited for 40 min while whatcing other people been seated and forcing their way into the tables.They kept telling us we had to wait our tabel because we are not frequent customers and they had a preference and could not say no for frequent customers.  Do not spend your time to go

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,"Good Restaurant, But Some Issues","Good restaurant, but our waiter seemed very green and unsure of himself.    We each ordered the formula for that evening, of a starter, main and dessert, and we were charged separately for each item, which we didn't realize until we got back to the hotel and were looking at the total. We intended to go back and ask for an adjustment, but we got busy with sightseeing and didn't go back.    For starters, we both had the cold veggie soup (pea soup, maybe? I don't remember). It was cool, refreshing and delicious. Next, boyfriend had the rotisserie chicken, and I had a white fish with a caramel sauce - which sounds weird, and it is, but it was delicious. We had a side of au gratin potatoes, which have to be the best I've ever had, and a ""complimentary"" side of mashed potatoes - also fantastic! (However, I believe we were charged for those as well).    We split a bottle of a nice white French wine. Dessert was a mousse of some kind, and very delicious!    Despite our waiter and the fact that we believe we were overcharged, we'd still go back. We'll just check the bill more carefully next time."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Great place to celebrate a special occasion,"Beyond having the best mashed potatoes you will ever eat, this is a great restaurant for celebrating a special occasion. Although on the very high end on prices, this restaurant is well worth it if you want to experience an exceptional tasting menu. Service was excellent."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Exquisit - after our fouth visit still!!!,"L'Atelier is quite obviously a place that atracts comentators that hate the place in advance. I have red few recent non favourable reviews. Although I strongly believe in necessary difference of opinion regarding food and chefs and restaurants, it strucks me whenever I read comments from that day I have visited or days around. It is highly unlikely that staff would be highly attentive and proffesional in my case and not in other cases. It is highly unlikely that my food would be designed in accordance with taste and general design pattern of the house but not in another cases.  I have been here already couple of years ago. And if I could compare, I would say that already perfect restaurant improved. I hate conventional Michelin restaurants for being mostly overambitious and poor in creating a taste. L'Atelier did not fall into this trap. In the contrary. Full bodied tastes all around. A touch of contemporary techniques, but just enough. What else to say?  Well: it is not cheap. 200eur p/p is minimum, I guess for an event that one deserves there. I did not regret any cent."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,One star dining at it's best,Incredible dinner for a fantastic price. Service could not have been better. Atmosphere was top notch.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Perfect place to dine solo!,"I was on a trip to Paris alone and I was looking for a place to have a fabulous dinner that wouldn't be awkward. This was the best place I could have chosen! There is seating at a counter/bar all around the kitchen. You get amazing service, incredible food, and a highly interactive experience. The serving staff was great and very friendly. I ordered the tasting menu, and they described each course, and I asked for suggestions for glasses of wine which were terrific. I can't wait to go back the next time I am in Paris!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Renowned Restaurant Delivers Superb Food,"I see the negative reviews below but our experience was marvelous--the hour was early (12:30-ish) and the restaurant pretty empty. We were seated nicely at the lovely central bar, which we very much enjoyed. The chef was contending with some difficult dish--beating it into submission--and the entire show was entertaining. Our lunch was reasonably priced but we had no wine--the wine list was formidable but truly expensive (a Pomerol for 14K euros!)."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Service as bad as the food was good,"The food was excellent. The service was soooo bad. Where do they find staff that bad? New dish arrived before the last one was cleared. Every time. Even after we complained and told them to slow down. The chef must be so embarrassed/angry to see such services. His food was so good.  Wine glasses are stupidly expensive. Lucky the service was so inefficient, should have had a few more glasses."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Nice experience,"Very good food, like always, the quail with foe was the best. Service weird at the beginning but great at the end. Only weird thing the waitress at the end asking us to leave tip at the credit card (u do not do that in...More"

Kanda,40,Good but not great.,"This is a 3 star Michelin Japanese restaurant in Toranomon. It’s very good food, but two issues prevented me to give 5 stars.  1. Rushed  There are only two seatings, 5:30 and 8:00 for this fixed coursed meal. Too early and too rushed for the early seating (you have to leave before 8:00), and too late for the second. For the price you pay, having to eat and “run” is not good.  2. Price  It is good food. However, it is not worth the price, especially given the fixed time schedule. There are many other great Japanese restaurants in the city that are a fraction of the costs and where you can enjoy a nice long evening."

Kanda,50,Excellent meal & service,"Just had a most wonderful meal served by very cheerful & friendly staff. Chef Kanda himself was there to too to dish out very generous servings of truffle on delectable sushi. We had monkfish liver & another fish liver plus cod milt in egg custard - all the dishes were well executed. We even had turtle soup. Overall, a very enjoyable evening with excellent service. What a contrast to our experience with Ryugin few nights earlier where we had most abhorrent & disgraceful behaviour ever of a restaurant manager! How on earth he expects to represent a 3 star Michelin with such draconian stance on lingering perfume smell which he apparently could still smell is beyond me. Anyway, Kanda has redeemed reputation of 3 star Michelin without pretentious long list of rules - after all, Japan has a Long list of excellent food & service culture & it is to our own interest as customers to frequent places which will provide both. Kudos to Kanda & his team as I was already so well feted to the best in Takayama & Kanazawa that I thought it would be tough for any restaurant to impress me further. Well done!"

Kanda,20,The most disappointing Michelin 3-star restaurant over years.,"I booked Kanda as I wanted to experience a Michelin 3-star restaurant with dear friends in Japan.    The whole experience was extremely disappointing for a so-called Michelin 3-star restaurant. Indeed, a clothes rack thrones in the private room, which is surprising for a Michelin 3-star restaurant. As for the cuisine, the pictures speak for themselves: crab salad without seasoning, fish roe too dried due to a bad frying, omelette on rice (the white truffle cannot hide the lack of cuisine), a flat taste dessert made from pear, etc.. Only the tuna sushi with white truffle was good.    My friends including a renowned French chef (Julien Duboué) and I were surprised to pay 400 euros per person for such a mediocre dinner.    This experience shows the inaccuracy of Michelin's judgments in Asia once again."

Kanda,50,A culinary experience of a life time,"Everything from the food, service and atmosphere at Kanda was perfect to the last detail and exceeded all expectations. I came here with my partner for our final meal in Tokyo. We were greeted outside the restaurant by a friendly staff member who guided us to our seats. The restaurant only has 8 counter top seats, making it an intimate experience where you can see your food being prepared right in front of you and where you can also interact with the head chef, Hiroyuki Kanda. The fact that you are greeted personally by the head chef and are able to see them work their magic in front of you really set Kanda apart from the other three Michelin starred restaurant I had been to in New York, where the head chef seems far removed from your dining experience.    We were served our first dish soon after we were seated and settled, and each dish followed in a seamless fashion, plated and served to us in perfect timing. They also did not synchronise serving the dishes with the other customers, which was something we experienced at another Michelin starred restaurant in Osaka which made it feel a bit rushed and impersonal. We were served 14 dishes in total, with the dishes paired with sake, wine, beer and champagne. The dishes were diverse and unique, ranging from cooked food and raw food including crispy fried abalone, kare fish, sukiyaki and unagidon. The food was like nothing I had ever experienced and was truely a product of the culinary genius of the head chef, Hiroyuki Kanda. Each dish and drink pairing was also described in elegant detail, both in Japanese and English. As someone who does not speak Japanese, I did not feel that the Japanese diners were given better treatment that foreign diners, which was also something I had experienced at other restaurants. Each customer was treated with respect and importance, regardless of what language they spoke.    From start to finish, the dining experience at Kanda was one of a kind and an unforgettable culinary journey. Deserving of all its Michelin stars and its reputation."

Kanda,50,5 stars,"Was looking forward to coming to Kanda for a while after hearing some positive things from friends and family. Kanda definitely did not disappoint and lived up to its 3 Michelin stars. The service was spot on and from the moment my partner and I arrived, the staff were extremely polite and friendly and took the time to introduce us to the rest of the staff and chefs as we entered. Kanda-san also took his time to personally introduce himself to us. The way we were treated within the first 5 minutes of us arriving was already miles better than some other three starred restaurants we had been to in Japan and what also set them apart was that they will not favour Japanese people over foreigners either. Even though I could speak Japanese, my partner couldn’t but the staff including Kanda-san made a huge effort to engage in conversation in English and to try and make sure all patrons felt at home.    The food was beautifully cooked and presented and was easily the best meal I’ve had in Japan up to this date. Personal favourite was the abalone out of the 14 dishes that were prepared for us. The alcohol pairing worked perfectly with every dish and was explained to us in quite detail. Alcohol ranged from Champaign, sake, plum wine, red and white wine, beer and tea.    I’ve read a number of reviews about Kanda stating that they were not happy with the atmosphere/decor/bar seating but what you have to realise is that this is the traditional way (counter style) in Japan and personally would prefer it this way as opposed to the more westernised table service way. This was also another reason why we wanted to come here also as there are not too many three starred places around the world where you can interact with the head chef/owner and watch your dishes being made right before you.    Overall an amazing experience and would recommend anyone wanting an authentic three starred Japanese meal here."

Kanda,50,Best service in class,"Very interesting business model for this 3-star restaurant: a small restaurant with only 8 seats for each diner session. The chef, one of the Top 3 cooks in Japan will be cooking for (and by) you, talking with you through your enjoyable and very special dinner.    In the segment of “high profile” restaurants, this is my score:  - Locale: 1/3. It cannot be better, because of the business model. The entrance is small, no waiting area, location is in the suburbs with no parking areas. Inside, very clean and minimalist... it does not look like a restaurant!  - Food: 3/3. Very impressive products and way of cooking. You even participate at some point in it (no spoilers here). The menu changes according to the time of year and daily availability of best products.  - Service: 3/3 +++. Outstanding, impossible to match: one of the top Japanese chefs cooking for you in front of your eyes, and enjoying the food together. Waiters are also very attentive and excellent professionals."

Kanda,40,Pretty good but probably not 3 Star,Had a dinner here with my wife - the food was great but the whole experience was short of Michelin 3 star. My one persistent memory was one of the waitstaff doing great big snotty sniffs every 2 minutes about 2m from me.

Kanda,50,Sitting with a friend,"Kanda, yes hard to find, the experience of food at its best. Only 6 dining the chef talking guiding and explaining as we ate. The food from magic green seaweed to pink tori is a taste of Japan we had hoped for. The accompanying drinks from a cold beer to nutty sake was wise. We loved it."

Kanda,50,Beautiful in all ways,"This was an incredible experience; all courses were delicious and presented beautifully (loved the momiji plates in particular). The service was wonderful, the waitresses were friendly yet professional and could explain the courses well enough in English too. Some of the dishes were truly stand-out and I'll be dreaming of them for some time, especially the chu-toro with truffle! The sakes we tried there were also perfect too. Will definitely return!"

Kanda,40,Exquisit and focused,"The Kanda is not easy to find. Not more than a small sign will tell you, that the wooden door - easily mistaken with an apartment door - will lead you to this exquisit japanese high end restaurant with barely more than ten seats.  the food is just sublime: very focused on the over-the-top-quality ingredients with a very focused presentation. the served drinks are also often japanese - so sake, but also from the finest quality.    all in all a nearly perfect experience. still i wouldn't go there a second time for two reasons: tokyo is full of high end restaurants - so there is a lot to discover. on the other hand the kanda is also exquisit expensive - even in international comparison. to be honest - i dined as good as in the kanda for a lot less..."

Kanda,50,Great Michelin experience,"We booked here through pocket concierge and it was simple and easy. Chef was so friendly and it is always a must. When you have a stern chef at such a nice restaurant it can make your experience less pleasant.    The food was amazing and we were able to talk casually with the staff about where the ingredients were sourced, how the kitchen worked in the back, and just have a great time.    Some items we had were the best uni I’ve ever had, local trout, tenderloin, cherry blossom sorbet...    Everything was on point, including the wine list - we opted for an amazing French Bordeaux.    Thank you!"

Kanda,50,Everything is good,"Been to Kanda according to Michelin guide. The restaurant is located far from busy, need to access by taxi and easily miss from outside. When entered, the decoration is normal. However, the service and food quality is exceptionally good. All food are freshly made and technique is superior. Most of the waiter/waitress are able to speak in English."

Kanda,50,Unforgettable,"We were three generations enjoying this unforgettable meal together. I don't even know how to describe the food. It was exquisite without being overly precious or ostentatious. Every flavor, every aspect of presentation was considered, and simple, yet we could enjoy our time together as a family without feeling out of place!"

Kanda,50,Best Dinner in Tokyo by Far!!!!,"The best dinner experience in Tokyo  Highly recommended it's an experience by itself, chef Kanda is a delight, nice humble man , with no other quest in life but to cook because of the passion he feels for his job and country.  Have studied in Paris for five years , he opened his restaurant, which is open only when he's in working otherwise is closed."

Kanda,50,Traditional and Innovative,Kanda was a refreshing experience! Having been to a few Michelin starred restaurants helmed by grandmasters of the culinary world in Tokyo we were caught out by the good mix of inventiveness and the traditional by this forward thinking master. This chef has departed from the safety of the past while keeping its links. I think Kanda achieves this because he trusts his team of chefs to deliver unlike some restaurants where the sous chefs remain meek and disempowered to move beyond preparing the sides and serving the dish.    The food is different and familiar and it helped that when we were lost looking for this obscure restaurant we met a friendly old gentleman out in the street who showed us the front door. It so happened this man turned out to be none other than the renowned master of Kanda. Like his food the grandmaster is comfortable doing something different.

Kanda,50,Great 3*-experience,"Last dinner in Tokyo (this time) - possible the first next time. Says it all. Kanda is worth every yen - and as a 3* Michelin VERY accessible. Reservations can be done online, master chef Kanda speaks French and English.    Well - not just your 3*-sushi, rather an Omikase / Kaiseki approach. 10 - 15 dishes, all executed to perfection, including rare ingredients such as fugu (still alive whilst writing), A5 beef, black truffles, Toro Tuna, special Japanese leek ... We paired the dinner with a bottle of their own Sake - Jumai Daigjinjo - which was fabulous."

Kanda,50,Prepare for a wonderful experience,"To get a taste of what a 3 star Michelin restaurant feels like, there's nothing better than Kanda. Its Japanese cuisine are prepared, as if to cater your cerebral senses and to get you to taste something elegant, yet hearty. It's surprising how this place is not in any major streets, so don't be discouraged when finding it because it's worth the confusion of getting to the small restaurant. We arrived earlier than the restaurant opening hours, but when the waitstaff found us outside, she let us in and showed us to our seat anyway. As we were seated, Chef Kanda himself was behind the counter to greet us and chat to us a bit while he was doing his food preparation. All of the staff spoke English and were very attentive to us even though they spoke with more ease with the local guests who came is for that night. We selected the 10 Chef's Selected Course, which was not enough. At the end of the night, I just wanted to taste more of what the chef can serve. Every dish was amazing and you'd be sad when the meal ended for you, too. To have this on the first leg of our visit to Japan would make it a memorable experience throughout our stay."

Kanda,50,Amazing experience,I was recommended by my friend to come here  Of course this is the Michelin 3 stars for 10 years and they definitely earned the reputation.  What you eat is only arranged by the chef and only the best seasonal food is served.  The whole menu is nicely designed and very exciting.  Although it is a bit expensive but definitely worth the money. This is one of the best I ever have. Highly recommended

Kanda,50,Top notch of everything,Outstanding wine list for such a small place. Glasses matching the wine! English is fluent. Food is outstanding. Comfortable dinner to enjoy the quintessence of Japanese cuisine!

Kanda,50,Definitely a good experience,"Kanda is an Omakase, which implies two things: (1) let you go through the artistic expression of the master chef with no decision what so ever (except avoiding your allergies), and (2) get the most interesting options for your plate according to the season. Kanda sensei is the perfect artistic combination of both, and has to be considered as an extraordinary culinary experience. This is a 3-star Michelin that provides you with a taste of the entire Japanese gastronomic culture, not only sushi. He is considered one of the 3 most important chefs in Japan together with Saito sensei and Jiro sensei. The food is something worth trying at least once in a lifetime. The place is difficult to find but no problem if you are getting there by taxi or with GPS. The venue is small and is not pretentious, which is part of the experience. It has room for 8 persons at the bar and another room with a table for a party of 8. This will grant you a perfect service, but will make the reservation a bit difficult If it is not done with anticipation. I suggest using Pocket Concierge (direct link form Kanda's website), but your hotel can also arrange the reservation for you.    Kanda sensei is at the bar, carefully preparing his masterpiece, and always willing to talk to his customers, with good interest in foreigners. Everybody speaks English there.    As you have noticed, I gave no description what so ever of the food. Why? Because Kanda experience is something that cannot be described. You have to live it..."

Kanda,50,One of the best Japanese restaurants in Tokyo,"The restaurant is small with only space for 9 diners, plus a private room.    The food was some of the best we tried in Japan. Dishes are simple as most japanese cuisine, but the flavor and chef's personal touch makes this a unique dining experience .    The menu came in 3 degustation sets. we chose one that included 12 dishes plus desserts  The courses are arranged more like kaiseki fine dining with a combination of cooked and raw food. And a good mixed of fish, seafood and beef.    It is an experience NOT to be missed."

Kanda,50,First Time Visit - Expectations Exceeded,"Charming, discreet, of the highest quality, Kanda exceeded expectations. With only 8 seats at the bar and one 8-seat private room, the attention to detail and care to ensure a proper Japanese meal is assured. Importantly, the offerings are seasonal, and offered Omakase (Chef's Choice). Unlike many high-end Tokyo Restos that focus on sushi/sashimi, Kanda broadens its approach across all Japanese cuisine. More diverse, and a nice change to fully appreciate the culture. The sake offerings are diverse and the staff will assist. Do give Kanda a try, take your time to savour the evening and enjoy the experience."

Kanda,50,"Some very fine points, and some not so fine.","Mr. Kanda is a great personality. Very fun chef, likes to discover other cultures and is genuinely interested in his foreign clientele which is a breath of fresh air in the 3-michelin star scene in Tokyo.    That being said he shines very well in some areas while some others lack luster.    First I would like to highlight some of the very nice dishes he served such as smoked river fish, tofu and uni in jelly, miyazki mango desert (to die for), chu-toro (yes I know it is not ""the best"" ""cut"" but it was unbelievably well selected) and fried abalone. These were fantastic.    Now the things that should not have been on the menu:    1. Asparagus from france (yes it's a fancy ingredient in france, but it has no place in a japanese omakase). It was nothing special and definitely is something extremely common in all high end restaurants in Europe, nothing to see, carry on...    2. Deep fried Wagyu. The meat itself was delicious. Selected from miyazaki cows it had just the right amount of meat-to-fat ratio however the deep frying took away from this fine meat and added unnecessary oil (and fatness) to an already fatty dish. Not to sound boring and classic but this would have better been served as is, grilled over charcoal with fresh wasabi.    As I said this was overall a very good experience despite some dishes lacking the ""wow"" effect. I would give this fine gentleman 2 michelin stars, and recommend to customers to eat at Ishikawa if they want a truly refined, memorable and amazing experience which is in the same style as Kanda."

Kanda,50,"Fantastic food, great experience","The restaurant was hard to find, so I would suggest leaving early and making sure you can find the building, as our taxi driver had difficulties.    Once we arrived though the experience was amazing. The setting is small and intimate, as others have mentioned, with only space for 9 diners, plus a private room to the side.    The staff were attentive, the company was good, and the food was absolutely phenomenal. the dishes were simple, yet the flavors were amazing and really showcased the ingredients. They had the best tuna I have ever tasted, it melted in your mouth..    Would highly recommend."

Kanda,50,Definitely worth your while,"Kanda is a 3 michelin stars Japanese restaurant. Kanda san is part of the troika of the big 3 sushi grandmasters namely Saito, Jiro and him. Considering the superb level of Japanese dining in Tokyo - Kanda comes with a HUGE reputation.  As in all top level Japaneses restaurants - the place is very discreet (it is difficult to find), located in the midst of the embassy row, opposite San Marino embassy, the interiors are subtle & understated and it is small (all the better for exclusiveness and cosiness)- 1 sushi bar that sits 9 and another adjacent private room which could seat a few more. We booked it 2 months ahead via our hotel's concierge.    The food came in 3 degustation sets priced at Yen 20,000 25,000 and 30,000. We took the Yen25000 set. I think it was 13 courses (inc 2 desserts). As it was plentiful.  This is not a pure sushi sashimi joint. So do not expect lots and lots of raw stuff. The courses are arranged more like kaiseki fine dining with a combination of cooked and raw food. And a good mixed of fish, seafood and beef.    Honestly in terms of presentation - I have been to better places. One may even be surprised/disappointed at the spartan appearance of the food. However don't let this color your judgment. For in its simplicity is the true essence of culinary delight. In the absence of distraction from artistically presented food - you could really focus on savoring Kanda- san's creation.    He has some personally created dishes that were excellent and unique in I have not seen it anywhere else. Some of our dishes include fugu with truffles, flounder wrapped in uni, superbly flavorful snow crab soup, butterfish, fried rice with dried shrimps. The pan sheared beef melts in your mouth. And the otoro - the best I have had. It was done in 2 ways. One is aburi style and the other, plain sashimi with sea salt. So good was it that we requested for seconds, Kanda said, we finish the entire course first and if we still have room after that, he would serve us the 2nd helping. Of course we made sure we had sufficient room to chow down the extra otoros.    All in all, it was an excellent dining experience. So this is what 3Michelin stars felt like - and it is felt really good :)."

Kanda,30,Emperor's New Clothes,"We went to the 6:00 p.m. seating. Very intimate setting -- room for nine diners. The chefs were perhaps 4 feet away from us the entire meal and they were clearly experts in their craft. The highlights were the oysters (incredible taste) and the blowfish (literally melts in your mouth -- now I get it!). Unfortunately, we found the rest of the meal to be basically average. While the presentation was superb, the dishes were bland and there was no engagement with the staff even though we reached out and asked questions. We were hurried through the meal while diners to our left and right were leisurely dining we felt pushed and were generally about two-three courses ahead. As soon as one course was finished the next was presented. The ultimate was when we were served dessert and the hostess came up to me and told me that the cab she had called was waiting out front. ""You go now."" Bottom line, we have been to many of the top 50 restaurants around the world including, among others, El Cellar de Con Rocca, Astrid y Gaston, The French Laundry and Per Se. All of these restaurants are about two things -- the meal and the experience. While the food at Kanda was fine, the experience was completely lacking. The stark comparison, however, is to Ginza Koju where we ate two nights earlier. What a great experience and there is simply no comparison between the experience at Kanda (not good) and Koju (over the top on all fronts). At Koju there was engagement from the moment of arrival, friendly discussion about the various courses and wines and just a nice feeling of being welcome. I would return to Koju in a heartbeat. Not Kanda."

Kanda,50,Amazing experience and food,"This was our first Three Michelin Star restaurant experience so we have nothing to compare this to, but you know it's going to be an exceptional dinner when there is a server waiting outside the restaurant on arrival knowing who you are.    The menu is modified based on the seafood available at the fish market, what you are drinking, and also what you don't like. There is no discomfort or raised eyebrows as you would expect from Jiro from 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi'.    As there are only nine seats in the restaurant (there is also a private room) the atmosphere is inherently warm and friendly, and you almost feel like a part of the family. Kanda introduced himself to us and was an absolute delight, and his English was very good.    The food was incredible, from the crispy oysters, to the battered white fish that literally melted in our mouths, to the amazing beef. The sushi was just on another level and deserves its own sentence; it was simply mind-blowing. The desserts need a mention too, both were tasty and light enough to nicely round off the experience.    As you'd expect, it is quite pricey, but worth every penny. Book a seat now."

Kanda,50,Great food,"Recommended. Much better than ryugin for kaiseki.  Went for first sitting at 6pm on friday night.  Location is in the charming residential area of motoazabu.  Better way to access the place via public transport i guess is from roppongi side (grand hyatt roponggi). Easier to navigate...    For myself, i walked along small residential side from azabujuban metro station. Its very charming, although certain part of the journey can be very residential, which can make you unsure if you are walking at the right direction. Just follow google maps :)"

Kanda,50,Absolute perfection,"Probably the most exquisite gastronomic moment we have ever spent.  A once in a lifetime experience  Go there for the ultimate nudity and sophistication of the decor, the fantastic show that Chef gives preparing fish with the greatest precision, the awesome degustation experience of 7 or 8 bouchees all delicate that will sublime the flavors you once knew ...  The dinner changes every day to give the pleasure of the novelty  A once in a lifetime experience"

Kanda,50,Mr. Kanda uses the most rarest and exclusive ingredients that pack the most natural favor,"Kanda, Three Michelin starred Restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.    Everything is just natural as you can go. Nothing is over powered and all you can feel is what the nature has to offer with its earthly aroma. Mr. Kanda uses the most rarest and exclusive ingredients that pack the most natural favorable flavor the mother nature has to offer. Nothing is too over cooked or undercooked, its just cooked to the perfect degree.    Every dish has its own meaning and it is never over powering. It feels like you become one with the nature. Sometimes you feel like you are in middle of the highest mountain eating the mushroom you just found with homemade fire. The miyazaki a5 filet is one of the most tenderest beef with the most beautiful flavor that is not from just the fat but the meat itself. White truffle has its earthy taste that makes you feel like you are eating in the french restaurant in some country side by the castle in some old village.    The flower eel with matsutake mushroom was one of the most beautiful complex yet simple dish i have had in my life. The knife technique used was incredible and im aware it is one of the most difficult and labor intensive dish to create. Ishikawa is very well known for this particular dish.    Overall its good but not michelin 3 star good standard. Its more like a solid 2 or maybe 1. I would not dine here again but I can justify the super price tag due to the rare exotic ingredients mr. kanda uses on all of his dishes. Also this restaurant is out of nowhere in the residential area literally."

Kanda,50,Very friendly chef Kanda San and wonderful food!,"We were very lucky to get the private room at Kanda, an intimate restaurant with only 10 counter seats and 1 private room. The food was of the highest quality with attention to every detail! The freshest seasonal ingredients including ayu and hamo. Chef was so friendly too! Great experience, will be back!"

Kanda,50,Such an experience,"We were Lucky enough to obatin a reservation. With Ultraviolet in Shanghai, in a completly different way, Kanda is one of my best ever culinary experience. Kanda is all about subtility, freshness, creativity and intimacy. In a very small restauarnt, over a counter, you are in direct contact with the whole Team and the Chef. Make sure to include Kanda in your scehdule when in Tokyo."

Kanda,50,Seriously good Japanese food in an informal friendly setting,"Tiny room, all counter seating, chef/ owner greets you, asks you what you don't eat, talks you through service . And what service ! Superb , delicate , delicious food . Hints of the chef's five years in Paris ( he speaks perfect English and French) , but overall Japanese through and through. Marvellous wine list , presented sweetly in a home made book with the labels pasted in. Good value , exceptionally enjoyable evening. Thank you."

Kanda,50,A perfect meal,We had Dinner on February 2 2015 at this fine restaurant. The place is small and comfortable. Food was very good and imaginative. Service was wonderful. Chef appeared impressively expert with the ingredients and very hospitable. Enjoyed every moment!

Kanda,50,an experience worth travelling to tokyo,"This place is truly unique. Located in a residential area, with an unimposing entrance it does not reveal any of the art going on behind the sliding door. One counter and approximately ten seats and absolutely fantastic food! One course better than the other and carefully presented! An unforgettable experience in Tokyo, I will come back!"

Kanda,50,one of the best in Tokyo,"I want just to say that it is a place to try . Quality, passion, art ! In this type of restaurant they have to surprise me , Hiroyuki was able to surprise with delicious , fantastic and outstanding things ."

Ristorante Reale,20,Disaster. Do your due diligence,"Three Michelin Stars means ""Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey"". Castel di Sangro is about a two hours' drive outside of Rome. The hotel was chic and the service was warm and attentive. The cuisine, however, was a total disaster that in my opinion was not worth a special journey (or any journey at all for that matter).    Let me first say that complicated culinary technique is all good and well insofar as it results in delicious food. In that regard, the menu was a failure. I will also add that I and my dining companions are all very open-minded to all sorts of food (as long as it is delicious)!    The tasting menu was a ""study of vegetables"" with some meats available à la carte. The common thread across the dishes is reduction sauces that are bitter, medicinal, and cloying.    The philosophy of this tasting menu is a stark, deconstructionist hyper focus on each vegetable with the use of little to no other ingredients than the vegetable in question. This means that you will not find interesting flavor combinations, composed dishes, or even pasta for that matter (!). Two standout offenders were the onion, which was just onion cooked various ways, and the mushroom, which was the same treatment but with a particularly disgusting flavor... think ""agricultural"".    There actually was one pasta: a chicken fusilli. This dish is a handful of fusilli haphazardly thrown on a plate and glazed with a ridiculous reduction of chicken stock that was tacky in texture and tasted like biting into a bullion cube. It was an insult to both pasta and chickens. It is blasphemous that a restaurant so seemingly focused on honoring nature would waste the lives of chickens in such a way. Other meats were finely cooked but suffered from the now-familiar bitter sauce treatment.    Dessert was a very very dry cake with an insipid bowl of melon juice to drink. It seems that the use of butter, eggs, sugar, etc. to create a cake would interfere with the philosophy of the tasting menu.    It is a shame that the Chef chose such a crude, deconstructivist, and in my opinion, disgusting menu. It is abundantly clear that he and his staff possess the technique to cook delicious food. Why not do that?    I am giving this restaurant 2/5 stars because of the nice hotel and the good service. As for the food: I would urge you to do your due diligence about this menu before making the journey. I would also urge the Michelin Guide to reconsider their 3 star rating or better yet, urge the Chef to change the menu before the Guide returns for another review..."

Ristorante Reale,50,Fantastic Experience Unforgettable Food,We enjoyed the food and experience at Reale. We found the 14 course vegetarian tasting meal interesting and delicious. Every course was memorable! Staff friendly and style lovely.

Ristorante Reale,10,Worst Dinner Ever!,"This restaurant was amazing, in the sense that it put us off Michelin star restaurants, probably for life. There were so few items that we tried that resembled actual food that actual people would consume, that by the end of the meal, we literally could not eat another dish. Dessert was out of the question. Everything was pureed and reduced to the point of torturing the ingredients, and the flavors derived from the torturing were so intense and bizarre that they took away any desire to proceed further. Let me say that we are no stranger to fine dining, and in fact just a few months ago, dined at another 3 star Michelin restaurant in Rome (look it up) that was at least very good. This was literally one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had, and to add to the insult, occurred in one of the best ""food countries"" in the world. Please, please give this one a pass. You're not missing a thing, especially in Italy, where outstanding food is around almost every corner."

Ristorante Reale,50,Extraordinary in every way,"I loved everything in this restaurant. The beautiful location in a 16th century convent where ancient art is blended with contemporary style. I am not vegetarian but i loved the tasting menu proposed by the chef. Each dish is amazing, simple base ingredients but processsed through innovative techniques and cooking are trasnformed in unique expereince. Just one example ""cocomero e pomodoro"" I especially loved all the three pasta courses. We orderd also ""piccione"" and ""calamaro"" just to try the iconic dishes by Romito. Desserts are surprising, once again simple ingredients but excellent results. Just to mention one, after the first one we ordered all the desserts in the menu, ""granita di liquirizia"". The suggested wine pairing is based both on local productions and international wines. In conclusion an experience to do, worth the price ."

Ristorante Reale,50,A great weekend in the Abruzzo,"The marvelous setting of Ristorante Reale and Hotel Casadonna in the Abruzzo mountains is worth a visit in itself. Nested into the estate's own vineyards and boasting a view across a broad valley, it is the kind of place where you want to spend a warm summer night on a terrace. The food of chef Niko Romito also lives up to its reputation. Recently, he replaced his tasting menu with a new plant-based journey of 14 courses that each put one vegetable at the center of the dish. While I did find that an exciting menu - and tastes were both bold and surprising at times - I was slightly startled that the à la carte menu on the other hand did not contain any of the vegan dishes but exclusively meat and fish based ""signature dishes"" of the chef. So while he seems to be most proud of his carnivorous dishes, chef Romito is not putting any of them in his new tasting menu. This approach seems to contradict the standard that a kitchen's tasting menu is the best way to experience its full potential. However, by adding a couple of à la carte courses to the tasting menu (to a very fair price), the best of two worlds can be combined. I recommend spending the night at Casadonna as this includes an opulent breakfast the next morning with delicious creations from the on-site bakery."

Ristorante Reale,30,"Great hotel, average food, confusing service","We were really looking out for this experience, but it was not as good as it should be. They even didint feel sorry, when they messed up and were bringing wrong food on our table. We really had to ask several times to get what we ordered. It not how it should be on this level. No apologies and we got a feeling that we did not understand their art. One course was hyper bitter, uneatable (and I really like bitterness when its on a reasonable level). My company could not eat few courses. Whats going on?"

Ristorante Reale,10,The worst restaurant ever,"The worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life, whether starred or not.  The expectation was high, but the disappointment was even greater.  Horrible food, no dish served to remember, on the contrary, to forget ... the food is so bad that it's hard to even describe why the Chef wants to serve it to customers ... pretty much everything made of fermented food, heavy food , unpleasant ... when you think of a 3 Michelin stars, like other excellent ones we know, comes to mind an unforgettable food, wanting to come back one day, but this one is simply to forget ... Unfortunately the bill is not unforgettable, on the contrary, it is very high!  Never spend your money in this place! Not worth it !  The chef doesn't seem to be very concerned about his customers, he doesn't appear in the room.  Do not waste your time or money in this restaurant, the customer is not well treated and does not seem important to them, there are thousands of other restaurants where you eat well, is well treated and the amount paid is adequate, starred or not."

Ristorante Reale,40,A very nice experience,"We were told by a friend, that there is a 3 star restaurant in Abruzzo, where we meke our holidays, gor many years now. We took a day off from the sea, and ventured in a beautiful landscape, with good roads and very little traffic, at lunch we were happily seated in a spacious room, with few tables, a lot of space between them, and an impressive number of people taking care of our wishes. We ordered the 7 dishes menu, with wines choosen by the cuisine. Every dish is perfect, every small or big detail is studied for a positive impression. We had a very good meal, but just one of the preparations has been an emotion: the fluffy pistachios, a small, green, light cloud that dissolves in your mouth, letting the remebrances of Sicily"

Ristorante Reale,40,Fancy Restaurant,"The service and staff were a 13/10. The attention to detail was exemplary. They noticed my brother was left handed and provided for him accordingly. The reason we did not give this top 50 restaurant 5 stars is because some of the dishes were subject to “trying too hard” syndrome. They emphasized form over taste. The infusions and the onion reduction with parmesan buttons were very good but then they fell short on the “ash potato” and the smoked beef tenderloin. For 300 euro per person, the food was OK, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was airy and beautiful (although a bit too modern for our tastes). Lastly, it was a terrible experience in trying to find the restaurant. Tip: Go through town and don’t venture down dirt roads!"

Ristorante Reale,10,Deluded,"My boyfriend and I had a reservation at this restaurant for lunch, to celebrate our first anniversary. He has been eating in Michelin Star awarded restaurants for a long time now, so he wanted to make me a beautiful surprise and I was pretty excited. We had several dinners at ONE Michelin Star restaurants and I can say I discovered a whole new world of taste, colors and shapes in ingredients that we all use to cook. So I got my expectations really high because I’ve read that there is a big difference between one and three stars. Anyway. We ordered “Ideale” tasting menù, €210 for person including 11 dishes. Again, I was expecting explosion of creativity, intense and precise taste, a lot of preparation behind every ingredient, an amazing experience. SADLY, food happened. Soulless food. No color, I can only remember BITTER taste, it seemed that something was missing in every dish. I felt very sad during lunch. I felt sad because my love wanted me to have the best meal of my life but the opposite happened. I’m not a connoisseur but before this disaster I had the privilege to taste dishes that took my senses to another level and I’m not exaggerating. This type of cuisine has to be amazing. It has to live the customer happy. If not, what’s the point? Spending time and money on something that doesn’t leave you with anything ?  Sadly, I won’t recommend this place to anyone."

Ristorante Reale,50,A must try,"It’s more than we expect, perfect foods, perfect services and very warm welcome by Chief Niko Romito. It’s recommended for culinary lovers, who love to discover the perfect Italian foods and restaurant."

Ristorante Reale,50,Stunning,"Everything was perfect  Location hard to find but it is amazing. The dining room is wonderfull, very few tables, lot of space  The service is very friendly, we took the 11 courses, the flow was perfect with the right time between the dishes  Food is amazing, very humble as the chef"

Ristorante Reale,50,Worth the return!,"Decided to stay overnight on road trip to Puglia. Last time was great and this time equally as good. There are two tasting menus plus a la carte. We had the 10 course tasting menu with matching wine - all beautifully cooked and presented. Chef Nico does not rely on garnish - the food is allowed to star. Eg. my piece of pork belly was perfectly presented on its own - no sauce no garnish and was delicious!  The rooms are very comfortable, breakfast delicious so all round a great stopover."

Ristorante Reale,50,Reale delivers the Quality and Service you expect at a 3 Star Michelin Restaurant,"It was our first visit to Reale so we decided to do the 10 course tasting menu with wine pairing. This way we could experience some of the Chef's favorite dishes and utilize his wine knowledge for pairings. We would recommend this approach. The next time we visit we decided we would each select three or four different dishes from the main menu, that way we can try some of the dishes that were not on either tasting menu. There were several dishes we wished we could try. We also decided that we probably would purchase wines off of the wine list rather than going with the pairing suggestions. In our opinion some of the pairings just did not work for us. The wine list is very long and we saw several wines we would like. So I think the next time, yes we will be back, we will order a bottle of white and a bottle of red off the wine list. This is a good restaurant. The dishes are very creative and the chef lets the natural flavors of the food perform by themselves without using too much spices and seasonings. We enjoyed our visit very much! Tip - because the restaurant is small - only about ten tables, reservations are a must. And since it will probably be a late night, consider staying in one of their nine rooms upstairs from the restaurant. Very nice, and they serve you a wonderful breakfast!"

Ristorante Reale,50,Outstanding lunch in Abruzzo,"Reale was a bit of last minute add-on to our Italy trip. We reserved for lunch just before we headed off on our trip, fitting it in between our stay on the Amalfi Coast and Rome. We drove the 3 hours to Reale from near Amalfi, and it was a gorgeous drive through the hills and flat lands of Italy. We got a little lost (follow road signs, not your Google Maps!) but made it just in time for our reservation. I didn't do much research into Reale ahead of time, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! Quite pleasantly. The decor is minimal, clean and it's very quiet. You have hushed conversations as it's only you and five other tables in the room. We giggled as the automatic lawnmower (like a Roomba) drove by the window as we dined. The staff was friendly and their English was fantastic, and we were the only native English speaking diners there. The food was outstanding, we did the longer lunch tasting menu. I was really blown away. Niko's food is the perfect embodiment of what you want Italian fine dining to be - classic Italian flavors, that you know and love, but approached with a delicate hand and the processes of a fine dining kitchen. I tasted tomato in many new ways that warmed my soul and excited my taste buds. I particularly loved the capellini pomodoro. A dish I love anyway for it's simplicity in most Italian restaurants, but done here in a unique and interesting way. One regret, we wish we'd known they had guest rooms, we would have stayed for the night! If you are able to visit Abruzzo, make sure to swing over to Castel di Sangro for an unforgettable meal and experience."

La Pergola,40,Superb but watch for the cancellation policy!,"This place is everything you expect in a Michelin three star restaurant. Fantastic view over Rome, creative food, lots of extras like little amuses bouche, a ballet of waiters anticipating your every need… The whole thing. It is expensive of course, about €250 per person, with a low end wine at €70; but one of us had a cheese course, and the other had a glass of desert wine, so the value is really not bad. The tasting menu did not look like a very good value.    But I would advise extreme caution about the cancellation policy, something I’ve never seen before. Quote “ In case of decrease of number of guests, late cancellation or no-show there will be a €250 fee per booked person or per missing cover.” That is in the fine print, hard to read, low down in the confirmation email that you get. It is an outrageous policy, something that I have never seen. So if you make a reservation here, you are taking a big financial risk. What if someone in your apartment gets sick? They have to come? Or you pay €250. Keep it in mind."

La Pergola,40,So this is fine dining...,"This will probably be my only experience eating at a Michelin 3-star restaurant, and what an experience it was! We had the 10-course tasting menu and were at table from 19.30 to 22.30 with no idea how the time had passed. My actual favorite dish wasn't part of the tasting menu - it was the mini-taco amuse bouches served before the meal began. Service was impeccable and unobtrusive. The chef himself came out to talk to each table, and I hope it's not disrespectful to say he was absolutely adorable. I heard him speak Italian, German, and English, and I wouldn't be surprised if he spoke a few more. Even though the portions were appropriately sized, by the end of the evening my tummy started to rebel and I couldn't finish the lovely chocolates served in a mini silver bureau. Everything was beautifully presented, and the entire experience will be a treasured memory."

La Pergola,50,A Culinary Benchmark,"Wonderful dining experience. The Michelin stars are clearly merited, with each dish showcasing precision and expertise. The service was professional and the ambiance appropriately refined. A reliably excellent choice for selective diners."

La Pergola,50,"Italian in Fuengirola, not to be missed.",We dined there tonight and it was delicious. We were a party of 9 and everyone enjoyed what they got. All the kids throughly enjoyed the pizzas. Not to be missed.

La Pergola,50,Absolute must do in Rome,"This is an absolutely incredible restaurant. Food is delicious and full of innovative and creative dishes. The tasting menu is pure magic. If you can, do it with wine pairing cu it is really worth it! The service is excellent and the view is marvellous!"

La Pergola,50,Peak of perfection,Just brilliant. An emotional culinary experience and 2 encyclopedias of Italian and international wine with a water list as well. Chef is every Michelin star worth its rating. Peak of perfection from staff to presentation to taste.

La Pergola,50,A true culinary adventure,"This was the most amazing culinary experience of my life. The staff at La Pergola goes above and beyond to create an epic culinary adventure for their guests. Special thanks goes to Dante, our Maître, Marco, our Chef de Rang and Matteo, the Sommelier for providing exceptional service. We opted for the 7 course tasting menu and were thoroughly impressed with not only the quality, innovation and plating of all dishes, but also by the “extras” provided by the team to deliver this masterful dining experience. Thank you all!"

La Pergola,50,Truly Superb!!,What an amazing restaurant this is!!  It is my third visit snd my friend experienced it for the first time!  We had booked four months ahead and we had a lovely terrace view !!  Given how many courses there are available we chose the pasta signature of the chef and risotto / my friend had pigeon - but every part of the service snd experience was amazing- we were offered lots of extra things that came as a surprise and the final box of sweet delights was amazing!!!  A fantastic experience and you will enjoy it!

La Pergola,20,Tourist trap,"Tourist trap    Go to Il Pagliaccio. It is sooo much better. La Pergola is as basic and mediocre as you can possibly get. Not worth 3 Michelin stars in my opinion. The food was average at best, the servers were very good but it was understaffed so poor guys had to run around and service too many tables. I think La Pergola is milking a dead cow, probably was good at some point but now it is just a trap for unsuspecting tourists trying to have a memorable dinner."

La Pergola,20,"OK food, terrible service and dated decor.","I was really looking forward to seeing what this 3 Starred, much-talked-about restaurant was like.    I wish I'd have gone to the local Pizzeria.    Firstly, the place looks awful. However, I will let that one go on the basis that tastes do vary. I'm just not a fan of the tired, dated and shabby look they have decided to keep since the 1970s.    Secondly, the service was dreadful. Surely, rude waiters and managers who ""apparently"" were doing us the favour of allowing us in the eat (and pay).    Thirdly, the food was OK. Nothing amazing, nothing sensational, just OK. Obviously, it was better than the local Pizzeria but definitely not 3 Stars. Perhaps bribery is alive and well in the awards department?    The highlight for me (or should that be low light) was we caught the waiter trying to give us a previously opened bottle of champagne and pas it off as new. We made him show us the top of the bottle he was covering up with his hand and it was already open! The manager did nothing and the waiter was stinking rude for the rest of the night to us because he'd been caught.    Finally, after our ordeal was over, they hated the fact we didn't want to leave a tip!!!!    The next night we went to a lowly 2 Star restaurant, All'Oro and the difference couldn't have been more night and day. Now that is a place I'd recommend."

La Pergola,50,Paradise above Rome,Absolutely perfect. Chef Beck is as creative as he was 15 years ago with a lot of new creations matching the signature dishes (Fagotellis are worth the trip !). Superb wine list and perfect service. The view on Rome is incredible . A real evening in Paradise. Just avoid to stay overnight at the Cavalieri. The old hotel has not any longer the level of service you would expect from a so called luxury place.

La Pergola,50,Amazing,"Excellent restaurant in the heart of Rome. We enjoyed our dinner in every way, absolutely amazing and outstanding experience! The scenery, the food, the wine list, but most importantly - the team!!! Very friendly and highly dedicated team !"

La Pergola,40,Loved the place !,"Very beautiful place with an amazing jazzy atmosphere. The food is great and cocktails too. Loved it ! Best if you are in couple trip, you will enjoy !"

La Pergola,10,Expensive tourist trap in need of an upgrade.,"I don’t know where to start. I have dined at many Michelin star restaurants all over and they all have certain standards.    I have been dissatisfied/disappointed with several Michelin star restaurants in Rome. La Pergola was not an exception. In my honest opinion, this is not a place that deserves 3 stars. The decor is tacky and outdated to say the least. If they offer you an “aperitivo”, that means 30 euros per glass of Prosecco or Spumante. The food is mediocre, non creative and extremely expensive for what it is. I don’t think it’s worth paying 70 euros for a risotto with fennel that I can make. We paid 500 euros for edible food but nothing impressive. The service was also all over the place. Even one of my favorite wines Gavi di Gavi “La Scolca” seemed off, corked. The whole place needs some serious updating."

La Pergola,20,Extremely rude staff.,Extremely disappointed with this restaurant. The service was indescribably poor. The sommelier was one of the rudest people we have ever met.

La Pergola,50,Best Italian,"The food, people and atmosphere was amazing. We love coming here the food can’t be any more delicious. And the people working here are the cherry on top."

La Pergola,50,The ultimate Special Occasion dining experience.,"This prestigious restaurant is usually booked up to a year in advance, my husband tried to get us in a few weeks ago, but they put us on a waiting list. To our surprise they had a cancelation, and we got a call in the afternoon. We took a taxi ride to the Waldorf Astoria, where the restaurant is located on the top floor. We were warmly greeted in the lobby and shown to the elevator. Upon arrival (a tad early) and check in, we were offered a seat in the clubby lounge. It is like sitting in your rich, gay great-uncle’s study. Leather, old art and a nice collection of Galle art glass. We took a seat with a view of everyone coming in and the bar. Since a couple having alcohol is going to spend close to a grand, it is interesting to see what types will be joining us for dinner. Probably half are youngish couples on a “Special Occasion” date, couples “of a Certain Age” and a few groups of friends/intimate parties. You have your table all night regardless of when you come in, they will not rush you so that they can seat someone else. Dress to impress, jacket but no tie for men. We lingered in the lounge over two glasses of Saint Petersburg Veuve Clicquot. They brought us a dish of the biggest Macadamia nuts I have ever seen and some bread sticks. With our second glass the brought a selection of tiny, unique appetizers. The cocktail napkins are real linen. They have ten two-tops in the first dining room and more four to eight-tops in the next room. They have an outdoor terrace with a stunning view, but it was not being used due to the rain. Since we were here to experience Michelin three-star dining, the view was not important to us. Upon being seated we are handed a list of 100 mineral waters to choose from. Broken down by country of origin, minerality and still/sparkling. We made our choice; it was swiftly brought in an ice bucket. Now to choose the wine. We could have gone with the wine pairings but decided to stay with the Saint Petersburg since it is hard to get at home. They probably have one of the best wine lists in Rome at 60,000 bottles. The wine list is in two volumes: Italian, and everywhere else. Now I am not a wine expert, but I am a Champagne expert, so often to judge a wine list (or wine store) I look at the Champagne selection. They had an impressively curated selection, although I would like to have seen the village of origin and if it was grand cru on the wine list. They bring the Champagne while we study the menu. They have a ten course and seven course tasting menu or you can order A’ La Carte. Because the tasting menu included too much shellfish, we went A’ La Carte. They brought an amuse bouche out first, just a teaser for good things to come. Then bread with the finest olive oil. Next you are offered your choice of four salts. In Italy you typically order an appetizer, a first course normally pasta and a main course usually meat. We both selected foie gras for our starter. It was sublime, with apple sauce and Turmeric crumbles. Next up the pasta first course. Here, they are right-sized. Steve’s was little pouches that when you bite into it, it fills your mouth with a light cheese/broth. Mine were a cone stuffed with a blend of ingredients capped with a slice of sausage in a delicious broth capped with fried kale and pancetta, my favorite course. My husband ordered the pigeon. The brought it in a wooden box that had been smoke infused. They carved the two breasts off in front of you and prepared the plate with the sauces. I was wondering what they did with the rest of the meat. I ordered to Turbot, which I was not thrilled with, although it looked pretty on the plate. We both had some selections from the cheese cart, all Italian cheeses, all excellent. We shared a chocolate souffle, although I intended to order my own dessert. A combination of the waiter’s grasp of English and the fact that I was female led to him never asking what I wanted for dessert. It worked out in the end, because they bring out this silver-plated tower affair with a dozen little drawers each hold a pair of micro petite fours. At the end of the meal, I can’t honestly say that the food is any better than the one stars in France we dined at this summer. I think that the fact that they changed the dinner napkins and the table candles before dessert, and the little silver petite four container must be impressive to the powers at Michelin. This meal in my top five lifetime favorites, and for sure raised the bar in some ways. They need to do something about the slapping noise from the revolving kitchen door, it was mildly irritating from where we were sitting, but would be very annoying closer. This is NOT a restaurant for inexperienced diners or picky eaters, and for god's sake don't even think about bringing a child here!"

La Pergola,40,The food and the service were both very Italian,"The food and drink were absolutely outstanding. I'm probably not an expert enough to discern the difference between one and three Michelin stars, but I can see why the cuisine here is right at the top of the world lists. You're going to pay for it, but for a truly elevated culinary experience, it's a decent splurge.    The service was very . . . Italian. Another reviewer called it ""aloof, condescending, and arrogant,"" which might be a bit harsh if directionally correct for the servers but described the sommelier perfectly well. Maybe counter-intuitively, there were some young, junior servers who were gracious and skilled, and that restored a little of my faith in humanity.    We were there in late October, so we couldn't sit outside. But the junior servers took us out onto the deck after dinner and I can see why the view is so talked about -- breathtaking."

La Pergola,50,Splendid,"Wonderful dinner from start to finish, and nothing less than I expected from a 3-star restaurant. The 11-page water menu might have been a bit over the top, but honestly, I'd rather politely decline these types of things than not see them at all -- it's all part of the experience. Truly worth splurging for a special occasion."

La Pergola,50,50th anniversary,Best restaurant in Rome. Amazing food and beautifull portions. Good service. we ate 12 course tasting menu. It was pricy but worth it to taste once in a life time. Views up there reataurant over Rome in when sun is going down is beautifull.

La Pergola,50,Still perfect,"We dined at La Pergola for the third time and found it again as wonderful as we remembered it. The ten-course tasting menu with wine pairing was delicious. The service was warm, friendly and professional. We hope that Chef Heinz Beck will stay on for many years to come and keep up his high standard.  We would like to thank the entire La Pergola team for yet another perfect evening."

La Pergola,20,Not worth it- wish we went elsewhere,"Was very excited to get a call after being on the wait list that there was a cancellation and reservation was available.    We had dined at La Terrazza (one michelin star) two days before and thus a lot of comparisons were in our mind.    Arrived 7:45 for a 7:30 reservation, restaurant mostly empty, felt like we were too early. Not a big deal but we felt out of place with the other clientele, myself and wife are late 30’s. Everyone else at the restaurant was much much older, we were hoping to see a more attractive / affluent crowd. Very different from la terraza    Decor was “nice” but felt dated, felt like we were in a time capsule from 20 years ago. A lot of reviews talked about the view, but we had no view from our table so there was no value for us here.    Water menu- a cool touch, havent seen this before.    Bread course was very good. Waiter couldnt tell us much about the salts except one was smoked but the salt selection was a nice touch. La terraza’s bread / homemade butter selection was our preference however.    Foie gras appetizer was phenomenal. Signature fagotelli pasta was very good. Linguini with clams equivalent was ok. Turbot was terrible, the disb looked beautiful but was dry and flavorless, we ate half of the $70 fish. The lamb was just okay, nothing special, finished only so we did not leave hungry. The gratis deserts were very good, we enjoyed the chocolate tower.    The service felt aloof, condescending and arrogant. My drink was empty far too often and at one point in frustration had to ask one of the servers who we needed to ask for a drink because the glass had been empty for far too long to be acceptable.    Overall- some hits and some misses. I do not expect any misses at a 3 star. Service was below average for restaurant of this caliber. Overall we had a much much better experience at la terraza, it really was superior on all points. Sadly we left feeling that we wasted one of our few nights in rome on a dinner that was sub par."

La Pergola,50,Unbelievable views and delicious food,"This is one of the best restaurants in Rome. There were 14 in our party and we were in Italy to celebrate a 50th birthday. Our group reserved a private room and arranged for appetizers and champagne upon arrival. From start to finish, this was one of the top dining experiences of my life. The service was impeccable and the food was both unique and delicious."

La Pergola,50,Worth Every Michelin Star,"The view is gorgeous with fabulous outdoor seating and sunset views. I’m not enough of a foodie to know the difference between a one- and three-Michelin Star restaurant, but the food and service were certainly superb."

La Pergola,50,Stunning as ever!!!,It was touch and go as to whether we could get into this restaurant as we booked 8 weeks ahead and all our nights at the hotel were fully booked for the restaurant- we had to wait for a cancellation and thankfully our last night we got the reservation!!  This was our second time here and the food did not disappoint!!! Everything is wonderful from the derby to the individual courses beautifully presented with care and attention and explanations!!!  My favourite was the signature pasta from the chef and I could have had another 3 plates it was so delicious!!!the breads were amazing snd the focaccia as crispy as ever with oils and special salts!! We did not get to see the chef this time but we truly enjoyed the evening !!

La Pergola,50,Best Meal of My Life,"This is the place to have dinner in Rome. You cannot get a better view of the city anywhere. Watching the city change as the sun goes down is an amazing experience. I can also see why La Pergola has three Michelin Stars, everything we ate was incredible. The staff was also very friendly and attentive the entire night. Coming here is worth every penny."

La Pergola,50,Lovely time in Roma,"Best restaurant in Rome! deserving of three-star Michelin star. The food was beyond delicious, fun and creative. It was a great balance between the taste of fresh ingredients as well as the richness of the food."

La Pergola,50,Stunning view. Impeccable culinary experience!,"We live visiting 3 star Michelin restaurants every chance we get and La Pergola was an incredible experience to end our stay in Rome! We were joined by our teenage daughters, who have food allergies. The chef and staff were incredibly accommodating and kind. The food was unbelievable and the wine pairings blew our mind. Our only regret was not getting a family picture on the terrace. We wish we'd arrived earlier and enjoy a cocktail outside. Next time!"

La Pergola,50,Living a dream,Probably the best restaurant i've been in my life. Service was perfect and the meal unbelievable. stunning wiew from the terrace

La Pergola,50,Best wedding day of our life thanks especially for the staff,"We had our 10. wedding anniversary and we had decided that we celebrate it in Rome where I proposed my wife 11 years ago.  We took the risk and our 7 and 9 years old sons were with us. We were worrying a little bit about their behavior and about how the staff of the three-star Michelin restaurant would accept them.  Our worries were absolutely unnecessary. Those people dealing with us were absolutely friendly and flexible with them.  We took some minutes before our dinner on the veranda of La Pergola above the Eternal City. It was breathtaking. We felt that we could catch the Top of the Basilica di San Pietro.  Afterwards we moved to our table and the inside was also amazingly beautiful.  We took the 7 dishes menu. No words to describe how delicious were all. Our sons has chosen with the assistance of our waiter a starter, prosciutto and a main course, sea bass which could not be found in the menu. My older son who is already a gourmet said the this prosciutto was the best in the entire world. They also liked their branzino very much.  We followed the suggestion of the sommelier with the pairing wines. His suggestion was also amazingly good.  At the end of our dinner we could enjoy gorgeous deserts.  The restaurant presented finally a bunch of 10 roses to my wife with an anniversary cake.  Moreover we could meet with the genius chef, Mr Heinz Beck at the very end of our dinner.  I should express our great tanks to the entire staff of La Pergola who has made our weddings anniversary è really memorable day."

La Pergola,50,Amazing,"Great service, Amazing food and service. I will be back for sure at La Pergola, one of the nicest place in Rome."

La Pergola,50,A great traditional experience,At the top of a hill with a sweeping view of Rome. Get to place early enjoy champagne on terrace. Style is old world and slightly frumpy. But where else will you find huge water menu with descriptions of different terroir and taste. Not cheap by any means but if you want to see the top of the old school italy by all means try to get a reservation.

La Pergola,50,Best dinner in Rome,Best restaurant in Rome … We had a fantastic dinner @ la pergola when we are visiting Rome. The patio was beautiful. The testing menu was delicious and the staff did everything right . It was best dinner experience

La Pergola,50,"inexplicable visit, it was one of the best restaurants I visited in Italy is it worth spending so much money","If you don't like to eat meat, this place is the one, the food is delicious, especially spaghetti carbonara and some attractive ravioli, the waiters are attentive, they give you a taste of their unbeatable champagne, you just have to Bring money because it is one of the most expensive restaurants in Italy, but for sure you won't regret it.  Prepare your clothes because the people who visit it are very elegant."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Great Awesome Spectacular Fantastic Fabulous,yes i love this place and i would love to go here again its awesome and all the food and the way its set up i just love it

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Superb!,Our meal was outstanding. Every course was beautifully presented. Every bite was delicious. The service was terrific. And what a building! Worth every penny.

Ristorante Villa Crespi,20,"Hoped for much, but under delivered","We were very excited to get one of our wait list requests for dinner confirmed for Sunday 18th June.    On arrival, the building architecture itself is a sight to behold in the lovely evening sunshine, but once you step inside, the “specialness” evaporates and you’re into an anodyne environment bereft of personality, atmosphere or joy. As we were shown to our table, passing isolated tables of estranged diners, I felt I was being taken to a waiting room for medical procedure.    Once seated at our table in what might be called a ‘garden room’, but was actually a corridor with windows to the garden. A garden that actually goes all the way to the shores of the beautiful lake Orta, just a few metres away, but you’d never know it being here as you can’t see it. At all.    Whilst all staff are professional, courteous and knowledgeable, they are unfortunately missing any warmth or engagement that puts one at ease so keen are they to follow protocol.    So, the food..  Whilst my wife and I could not be described as connoisseurs, we have been fortunate enough to eat in, and experience some of the loveliest, starry, places across europe and the USA in our 29 years of marriage. Unfortunately, this wasn’t one of them.    The eating experience as a whole, from the amuse bouche, table settings, crockery and menu is confused, complex, over engineered. The menu is discordant and full of ingredients that suggest someone is trying too hard to show how well they can cook what ever you might give them to prepare. I have never seen snails, frogs, sweetbreads, eel, pigeon giblets and kidney all in one menu and all in different dishes. Whilst one of greatest pleasures of such skilled craftsmanship is to experience what can be done, we actually found ourselves choosing the least worst from the menu, and we would consider ourselves adventurous.    In hindsight, we should have left after our aperitivo and menu review, but trusted that Michelin awards are hard earned and warranted staying the course. Unfortunately not, and I’m unable to recommend the restaurant to anyone, regardless of the astronomic prices charged."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Heaven on Earth!,One of the most memorable restaurant experiences of my life! This was a delicious feast for the senses. It was as much of an art show as a delicious meal extravaganza. We started with a drink at the bar with Lorenzo and followed it with 9 courses of foot and wine heaven. Save room for the three courses of dessert if you do the Tour of Italy tasting menu. It is all worth it! The chef met us after dinner and was wonderful. He has created a little Garden of Eden in Italy! A must visit from Milan and even from the USA!

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Best Italian restaurant,Best restaurant with amazing ambience and vibes were so soothing. Staff was also professional and kind and cuisine was finger licking.

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,"A Truly Inspired, Deluxe, Delicious Foodie Experience-Not To Be Missed!!","Chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo and his staff at Villa Crespi can be very proud of their WELL earned Michelin 3*. Everything about our dining experience was superb and well worth a special journey to enjoy. What better way to celebrate or start a journey through the Italian Lake District than with Italy’s newest 3* restaurant. The food is elegant, visually stunning, complex, fresh, well-crafted, an explosion of complimentary flavors, and above all super tasty. The servers are consistently attentive, personable and above all highly professional. The setting at the Moorish inspired hotel is stunning. What I also appreciated at the restaurant was you had options including two distinct tasting menus and a la carte. We went for “The Italian Journey from South to North” menu which included quite a few of Chec Antonino’s inspired classics—simply delicious from beginning to end. Definitely a deluxe foodie experience that is not to be missed!!"

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Truly Exceptional!,"The restaurant boasts a Michelin-starred cuisine and serves delicious local dishes. The staff is friendly, attentive, and always ready to help. Villa Crespi is truly exceptional, making it a perfect retreat for a romantic getaway or a peaceful vacation in Italy."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,20,Hair in the BDay cake,The experience in general was nice. The villa itself is really beautiful. Kind staff. Good wine    But at the end of the whole lunch we saw a hit in the cake. Of coarse it was disgusting for the place that presents itself as a high standard restaurant.    In these situations it’s the choice of the restaurant to decide how to act and how to treat the guests. What we’ve got is “we are so sorry” and the “complementary hair cake” 🤣 and a lovely photo with the Chef who probably didn’t even know the situation.    There was also one more point. Our table was at the terrace and next to the window there was a thick really visible layer of dust. So bad that I didn’t even risk to out my bag there. In comparison to the “hair cake” it was absolutely predictable and could be easily cleaned before the guests come.    All in all there are human changes to be done in such a beautiful place. The main advantage of the restaurant is the place itself nor the restaurant quality.

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Beautiful place and exquisite food.,"Lovely food, amazing food presentations, extra bites and elegant atmosphere. The photo opportunity with the Chef himself and in the garden grounds is something you should not miss. We paid 370 euro for a lunch for two - no wine."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,40,totally worth the two stars,"We had had a wonderful lunch at Villa Crespi in late 2020 and recently returned. Again, we were not disappointed. Service was not quite as attentive as in 2020 and there seems to be a large turnover of waiting staff. Once a young lady took over our service, everything went fine - she was very good. We all had the frog legs with whipped butter as starter - that was terrific. I had the sweetbread as a second starter, and that was very good too. My pasta dish was linguini with sea urchin and saffron sauce - the dish my wife raved about two years ago, and which she also had again... excellent indeed. The bottle of Coppo Chardonnay 2018 was fine. It will not be a mistake if you check the bill upon presentation - we noted, after leaving the place, that the glasses of wine as apéritif and the chardonnay had been slightly overcharged - not much but still.  Antonino Cannavacciulo has clearly carved out a little niche for himself in this lovely place. The restaurant is fully booked even in the off season, and there are frequent and numerous diners from nearby Milan..."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Fabulous restaurant,"A beautiful building set in a lovely park. The restaurant is divided into several rooms, intimate and relaxing. The food is beyond words, culinary masterpieces beautifully presented. Wines from all over the world.Very efficient and corteous staff.  We can definitely recommend it, the price is justified by the excellent quality."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,30,I had higher expectations,"We were 3 in total and we all chose an aperitivo and then the “dal sud al nord” menu. They were kind enough to exchange the meat course for one of us (the pork of the carpe firm menu instead of the pigeon).  In general, the food was of excellent quality and taste. Absolutely divine!  However, there were some negative aspects which led me to rate this a 3/5.  Service.  1. In the beginning there were two waitresses who seemed to not agree on how to place the dishes and were correcting each other. The younger one was kind enough to ask how we enjoyed the first course. However, after this course the other one took over by herself and rushed us through, taking away plates when one of us was finished while the others were still eating and not even asking once if we liked our dishes.  2. It felt a little like being at a sales show after the main course when they came around with their cheese tray and a big port wine bottle asking if you wanted something. Plus, 20€ for two small slices of cheese seems too much even for a 2 starred restaurant.  3. I found some bones in my fish dish and while this can happen, it shouldn’t. Especially not in a starred restaurant. The least that could have been done is to apologize once you see the bones. Alas, nothing.  Cannavacciulo himself  When arriving we had been told that the chef would come out when you pay for a chat and also a photo opportunity. Well, either he wasn’t in the mood, had a bad day or is always like that… but, rushing through a picture, not smiling at all and making you feel like this is a huge annoyance to him is not the way to go. Then stay in the kitchen if you don’t feel like it."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,20,Not recommended,"Truffle & wine as I like …  but My friend was poisoned 🤮  My meat set with truffle was ok , service also was good. Hotel room I like , smell in hotel was nice. Reception desk called to the doctor & no possible to reach it. No doctor & no emergency service 😐 shocked about attitude restaurant charged full price for dinner with poisoned scampi 🍤 no excuse & no sorry ☹️ can’t recommend that famous Michelin restaurant 🛑 ✋"

Ristorante Villa Crespi,40,Outstanding food and location,"The restaurant is locate in the most beautiful villa, in the cute little town of Orta San Giulio, which is great to visit. The location doesnt get any better than this.  The food is outstanding. Every dish is an explosion of flavor but so well balanced. Its a great food experience, one of the best in the world. Italian cousine at its peak.  Overall you have a fantastic experience in this place and its very recommended.    However, since the expense is very very significant, one expects absolute perfection from a place like this. But there were a couple of things that I think should be improved:  1) when you book they ask you of you are going there for a special occasion, like a birthday. It was my partner's birthday and I was expecting some little cake or similar. But nothing.... I would reccomend not to ask for this things if you do not do anything about it. You set expectations that were not met.  2) relax a bit the table service. It did feel a bit rushed and you feel very observed. As soon as you put your fork on the table somebody rushes to take your plate away and one minute after you receive the next one. Once my parner hadn't even finished eating... Rethink a bit the timing."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,"A Two Stars, Italian classic food: superb!!","It's not my first Michelin stars restaurant I visited, but it's the first which combines real traditional plates with an high quality standars, 2 Michelin stars are more than deserved. Furthermore location a luxury Villa in moorish style it's unique and service aligned with standard of a multi Michelin stars. I chose the Italian Journey menu: it's a not easy journey a lot of plates.....My favorites were ""Gragnano's Linguine"" and ""Sucking pig roasted"": these probably are the best Italian plates, I've ever eaten, and I visited a 3 stars Michelin restaurant. Dulcis in fundo, we met Mr. Cannavacciulo: he was very gentle and emphatic, not all chefs are so. Prices you can check on their site.....aligned with a Michelin stars restaurant.....I can't wait to visit again!!!"

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Beautiful palace,"During the pandemic of COVID-19 the restaurant and the hotel are closed I can only admire the beautiful palace.  ( The restaurant is direct by a famous Italian chef Cannavacciuolo )  This Villa with arabesque characters was built in 1879 by Cristoforo Benigno Crespi who was an important textile entrepreneur, initially it was named Villa Pia in honor of his wife .  The architect Angelo Colla designed it with a Middle East style .  Beautiful.  The tower can be seen several kilometers away from here."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Top class,"We visited Lake Orta for two days and could not miss a meal at Villa Crespi. Our lunch there was excellent, from the nibbles to the petits fours. We went à la carte and each chose a starter, a pasta dish and a main. All were excellent - my wife thought the sea urchin linguine was the best pasta dish she ever had, and my risotto with cubes of veal kidney was excellent too. The main of eel that my wife had was special; my red mullet was very good; our daughter was very happy with her pigeon main. We had a bottle of Coppo Chardonnay riserva della Familia 2010, recommended by the sommelier - lovely, and better with every glass. We had lengthy exchanges with the sommeilier about what it takes to have Italian gastronomy survive the Corona pendemic, and about his experiences in Hong Kong (he was sommelier for two years at Arbor, an excellent 2 star place - reminiscing about the HK restaurant and food scene with him was a treat). In short, we have eaten worse in a number of three star restaurants all over the world, but only once or twice at the same level or better in a two star restaurant. This is most certainly a place we will return to."

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,The lunch of a lifetime,"Peerless from start to finish what could have been an intimidating and unpleasant experience was rendered warm, engaging and friendly by the terrific team. In our case a wonderful lady by the name of Erica worked hard to make our lunch of a lifetime as perfect as possible. Generous, helpful, knowledgeable and thoroughly professional, Erica is exactly the kind of employee that we would all love to have on our team.  The combination of her approach, the sublime presentation, the incredible surroundings and out of this world food made for a splendid experience.  Go, if you can go twice. It’s sublime!"

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,wonderful,"Ristorante Villa Crespi has a perfect location and view. It surrounds the Orta San Guilio lake and a series of wonderful gardens. Even getting to the restaurant is dreamy as you go through the Milan highway and get the opportunity to admire the luxurious architecture of each building. Everything about the food was fantastic, you could literally taste every ingredient on the plate.    The head chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo even let us take a look throught his kitchen and we were able to see the making of those perfect dishes, I would definetly go back and I totally recommend it !"

Ristorante Villa Crespi,50,Exquisite creations,"This restaurant certainly deserves its stars and accolades! The food was delicious and distinctive, with service to match. There were a lot of small courses, painstakingly and artistically presented, while the menu followed a good plan and achieved a well-balanced result. The minimalist decor provided an interesting counterpoint to the ornate old ceilings. I went to bed satisfied and happy, hoping to dine here again!"

Dal Pescatore,50,Amazing experience,"Fine for anything especially the service quality From the side such as dishes the caviar is quite good and it’ ideal is from Pâté en croûte, but the ingredient which the restaurant use is much better than the original recipe."

Dal Pescatore,20,A huge disappointment,"I explain the reason for my vote: I am a fan of good cooking, I like to cook as a hobby, I love to try starred or otherwise good restaurants, especially to try unusual dishes, preparation methods that I would not be able to reproduce at home, inventiveness applied to cooking... in short, to amaze myself. I expect this especially if I am talking about a restaurant with three Michelin stars.  The first impression on arriving at Il Pescatore is excellent, an evocative location, a very friendly welcome from all the staff in the dining room (which will prove to be the only voice that lives up to the restaurant's name throughout the meal), and great attention to detail.  As I usually do in this type of venue, I chose the tasting menu to be taken on a journey chosen by the kitchen, on their signature dishes. The menu is boring, banal, with dishes that in most cases I have already seen and re-seen. There is never a flicker, a thrill, an emotion in either the presentation or the flavours. It is a restaurant that lives on the glories of the past and on self-aggrandisement (dishes conspicuously signed with the restaurant's name), offering cuisine that is not traditional, but old.  I conclude by saying that one of the courses was wrong, fish with completely the wrong cooking. I point this out and the reaction is certainly very composed and polite, I am offered a new course. The question is, can such an incident happen in a restaurant of this level? For me not. I also think that the episode should be taken into account when presenting the bill, which given the price (the one that is STELLAR), cannot have flaws in the meal."

Dal Pescatore,50,Extraordinary Excellence of Taste and Elegance,"Lunch in mid July. An Extraordinary experience of taste in this exclusive unique estate. This is a joyful return after a long time, a great chance for an exquisite journey into the history and into the avanguarde at the same time. This is something everyone should live at least once in a lifetime because it really worth it. There is no comparison. Every dish is an experience of taste and sensemaking in kitchen and products are at the highest level as well as the service. Awsome for a special event. Thank you Santini's, you're really on top!"

Dal Pescatore,50,A great pleasure,"I can only second the glowing comments of many other reviewers here. In addition to the exquisite food and wine and the lovely, well-kept dining room, one can really feel the warmth of family tradition with which every aspect of the experience is imbued. The only downside is that there is nowhere to stay within walking distance, and taxis aren't plentiful in rural Italy. The excellent hotel Palazzo Quaranta in Isola Dovarese kindly provided me with private shuttle service."

Dal Pescatore,50,tortelli di zucca,"Been abusing this resto for decades. Why not? It is the best in Italy. Certainly the best traditional restaurant in that land. Actually it battles the world for the best with the likes of Berasategui in Pais Vasco, Michel Bras in Laguiole and Can Roca in Girona. Check out the balsamic vinegar operation in the back upstairs. The owning Santinis are a stellar family in themselves."

Dal Pescatore,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"This truly special family-run restaurant accommodated our family with grace and warmth, even inviting our youngest two into their kitchen to make pasta. The food is exquisite, the service second to none and the wine truly outstanding. Moreover, the knowledge and savior faire of the family stands out, demonstrating their passion for food but also for welcoming every guest personally. Their restaurant and garden are beautifully cared for and classically stylish and we would like to thank them for our visit. Benissimo!"

Dal Pescatore,50,This must be what heaven tastes like,"Pricey, yes but worth every cent. You feel welcome as soon as you park. The staff is amazing so are the members of the Santini family who owns the place. Courtesy meets professional service at the highest standards. The food puts to shame every other restaurant I have been to (aside from Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons from chef Remond Blanc) and the menù is varied and full of surprising flavours."

Dal Pescatore,50,Should be 5 michelin stars if that existed,This place is absolutely amazing. The owners and staff are complete class.    Very elegant setting while not overwhelming. You feel comfortable.    The chairs are also SUPER comfortable. Tables are spaced out perfectly.    And of course the food... is divine. Some of the best I've ever had anywhere.    Absolutely worth the trek out into the middle of nowhere for it.

Dal Pescatore,50,"Absolutely amazing, spectacular food and exceptional service!","My husband treated me to a wonderful birthday surprise! The food was delicious, the sommelier was incredible with his knowledge of wine and the service was impeccable! I love the story behind this restaurant .... I love the family feel and attention to details. Thank you for a truly wonderful evening .... cherished memories!"

Dal Pescatore,50,Amazing deserts,"We came just for the cakes, hands down some of the best cakes I have ever had. Coconut Tiramisu, Chocolate Marshmallow cake and strawberry tiramisu, all home made and taste absolutely amazing. Highly recommend."

Dal Pescatore,50,One of Favorites,"We went there as a family of 5, including our daughters ages 6 and 7 and we loved it. They were so caring and accommodating to our family and made us feel right at home. Towards the end of the meal when the girls got a little restless, they even played cards with them while we finished our meal. Every dish was well thought out and presented. Would highly recommend!"

Dal Pescatore,50,Another unforgettable experience!,"This is just an amazing place where everything is perfect: the elegant location, the attentive and yet friendly service and above all the spectacular food and wine.  The Santini family makes you feel home and will take you through a fantastic sensorial journey. And for a 3* restaurant, it’s more affordable than you think.  It’s a must if you happen to be in Lombardy."

Dal Pescatore,50,Extraordinary hospitality complementing fine cuisine,"We were delayed en route and arrived at the restaurant over an hour after our appointed time, just before the last order deadline of 2pm. We had previously been refused entry at another Michelin-rated restaurant in Italy at 1.55pm, and so felt anxious about timing when we arrived. Sommelier Alberto Santini instantly soothed us by explaining there was no rush at all. We then had a wonderful meal with every dish executed perfectly. Antonio Sanitini stopped by at our table to chat several times. We ended our meal at 4.30pm (feeling guilty about the late timing) but were escorted out very graciously by Antonio, who waited patiently while we sorted out our GPS before pointing us in the right direction. Dal Pescatore more than deserves its three Michelin star rating: quite apart from creating fine dishes, the Santini family truly understands, and lives, the concept of hospitality."

Dal Pescatore,50,Food at its finest,"This 1925 three star Michelin is a stunner in every respect. I tried the degustation menu and I am at a loss of words to describe what I ate. Service was at its finest. Never seen such a collection of wine before. They even have a helipad for those who fly into this tiny village in the countryside. It’s expensive of course and if you can afford it, the memories would last a lifetime. My salute to the Santini family that runs this restaurant."

Dal Pescatore,50,A gem in every way,"It is difficult to decide which of Dal Pescatore's virtues to spotlight first: the conception of the dishes, the execution, the welcome from the family, the service, the wine list, the warmth of the rooms. Suffice to say there is perfection in every detail. I think it starts with the fact that this is a family restaurant: Nadia and her son, Giovanni, in the kitchen; Antonio and the younger son, Alberto, in the dining rooms. There is a gentleness to Nadia that emerges immediately as you talk with her, and that is expressed in her food. There is no artifice in what she and Giovanni prepare. Each dish is pure, elegant, and refined. Hard to name a favorite, but a few that spring to mind: the pumpkin tortelli (a signature dish that is both subtle and complex in its perfect balance of flavors), the long cooked beef shoulder with Nebbilo sauce, the lobster terrine with caviar, grilled eel. Antonio and Alberto run the dining room with warmth and professionalism. In some ways, each one of the dining rooms have a Japanese flavor to them, as each has an intimate view on at least one wall of the garden. Wine list is fabulous. The only downside is that the restaurant is close to nowhere. But that does not deter in the slightest pilgrimages by foodies who fill up the tables every night."

Dal Pescatore,50,This is just miracle!,"No wonder why Nadia is first Italian female chef to get Michelin star.What she is doing i that kitchen of hers no one can describe differently than ""miracle!""Pigs feet, duckling and permesan tortellini - heaven!"

Dal Pescatore,50,Is this real?,"If you want to go to eat in this restaurant you need to forget all your past culinary experience, because this experience will be the only one in your life! You have to follow all your 5 senses, and let your soul traveling throw the...More"

Dal Pescatore,50,The finest restaurant in Italy,"Without doubt, the most consistently finest restaurant in Italy. Each time it seems to get even better which amazes me. Nadia Santini produces the most magical dishes. Do try the Dal Pescatore Tasting Menu which included the most amazing Lobster Terrine Her son Alberto, the...More"

Dal Pescatore,50,The Finest Restaurant in Italy,"Owned and run by the Santini family, Nadia Santini works miracles in the kitchen preparing the most magical innovative dishes. The tasting menus are exceptional, accompanied by superbly chosen wines. What a treat!"

Dal Pescatore,50,The finest Restaurant in Italy,"Each time we go there the food gets better and better. Nadia Santini is a genius creating the most amazing dishes. The tasting menus' are gourmet delight. The family who run this restaurant are magnificent, friendly and knowledgeable"

Dal Pescatore,50,Imperial and Wonderful,"Little to say: total excellence. Service, food, wine, atmosphere, friendliness of the Santini family. Experience to do at least once in life to a great opportunity. The history of restoration in Italy."

Dal Pescatore,50,Going back to the roots,Dal Pescatore offers an amazing gastronomic experience in a beautiful set up and is geared to bring the taster through a palate journey. They've created a great environment with an unparalleled attention to detail. Thanks to everyone at Dal Pescatore!

Dal Pescatore,50,The finest restaurant in Italy,Located in the heart of the country ~Nadia Santini and her family run the most amazing restaurant where she prepares the most outstanding food i have ever eaten - sheer genius. A must for anyone visiting Italy

Dal Pescatore,50,Elegant perfection.,"We made a detour here for lunch on our way from Lake Garda to Parma. It is a mission to get here, but once at the restaurant it is an on oasis of quiet elegance.  We had the degustation. My only negative comments are that it was less innovative than the other Michelin star restaurants we have eaten at and there was a heavy influence on pasta type dishes, 3 of 7 dishes.  That said the food was excellent and the presentation amazing. Every course was a feast for the eyes and the taste buds. My favourites were a lobster terrine and the most lovely piece of sea bass I have ever had, served with tiny pieces of summer fruits.  We had two half bottles of wine and a glass with dessert. At 450E it was an expensive afternoon but a very memorable one which we recommend if you are into fine food and wine."

Dal Pescatore,50,"Homey yet Stylish, and Impeccable","We were fortunate to visit a total of three Michelin-three-star restaurants in a short trip to Northern Italy (the other two being Osteria Francescana in Modena and Da Vittorio near Bergamo). Each has its own distinct characters and we enjoyed every meal tremendously, but Dal Pescatore lingers in memory as a combination of being down-to-earth and perfectly professional.    It is truly a family affair here, now in their third- and fourth-generations (and the first member of the fifth just born a year ago, as proudly announced on their website). Alberto, the younger son, who is also the sommelier, greets and looks after you the entire meal. Both Nadia and Antonio came out to say hello. Even from a very brief encounter, we could feel such warmth radiating from Nadia, who was voted the best female chef of the world by Restaurant Magazine in 2013.    As hinted on their website, the cuisine is firmly based on traditional Italian and yet they strive to keep up with modern techniques. We opted for the tasting menu (Primavera, which I think implies it rotates at least seasonally). The list of dishes is provided below, which I could not find on their website. I do not wish to violate the owners' wish to keep the dishes not widely advertised if it is indeed their preference, but I think the readers here would benefit from getting some specifics.    Lobster terrine with ossetra caviar and pickled ginger,  Potato gnocchi, tuna roe, pea cream, and crunchy fennel,  Saffron risotto vialone nano, fried artichokes and balsamic vinegar tradizionale,  Pumpkin Tortelli,  Seabass with parsley, anchovies, salty capers, and Tuscan extra virgin olive oil,  Saddle of venison with cabernet sauce and blueberries  dessert    There is a slight emphasis on fish and seafood, in keeping with their name and tradition. We were glad to see the Italian dishes in a top restaurant - the sparkling yellow of the saffron risotto presented at the perfect temperature lingers in my memory, and Torelli di Zucca is their signature dish.    I translated the above items directly from the copy of the menu we received at the end of the meal. I had complemented on how beautiful the menu looked at the beginning, and Alberto made sure I left with a ""life size"" copy of the menu the cover of which is newly designed by artists every few years. Back home, I noticed a brief family history written on the back of the menu in three languages. If you would like a copy, be sure to ask.    For the tasting menu, we paid 175 Euros each, which includes tax, so it is a bargain compared to the comparable meal in the U.S., especially now when the dollar is strong against Euro. The wine list is extensive but also a bit expensive compared to other European establishments - thankfully we are not big wine drinkers. I had a flute of spumante aperitif (Annamaria Clementi, 20 Euros) and a glass of French white (45 Euros).    The location could be an issue for some. It is sort of in the middle of nowhere. We took the train from Milan to Piadena, where we had a little trouble finding a taxi for a 10 Euro ride to the restaurant. An alternative is to arrive at the even smaller town of Canneto Sull'Oglio. If you are driving, you can probably find it easily. The directions are on their website.    In summary, if you want a three-Michelin star experience at an establishment that feels like someone's home where you are served an impeccable meal deeply rooted in Italian cuisine, this is the place for you. The Santini family has done a marvelous job. For nearly a century."

Ristorante Uliassi,50,White Beach Dream,"A hydillic place to enjoy the three Michelin stars in Senigallia. You feel like you're on the beach but with style. Sunset, the breeze from the sea and the beautiful, bright, comfortable interior. The white, more elegantly decorated ""beach hat"" is suddenly on the table like a palate fairy tale book. A delicious journey through the flavors and ingredients of ""mare e Monti"" (sea and mountains) Fantastico! Must visit and enjoy. Very nice competent staff, professional Sommerlier accompaniment and very friendly with children."

Ristorante Uliassi,50,An innovative great simplicity- Italian Journey,"Contrasts of temperatures and flavours always balanced and tasty. Attentive and discreet all the staff, they pampered us without unnecessary servility, elegant and simple environment, the real star is the dish that come through as an innovative simplicity. surprising and unforgettable, not all the time, but certainly the best Michelin comfort food, I have ever had. Great!"

Ristorante Uliassi,50,Excellent experience,"The restaurant is located next to a beach. We can see the sunset before the dinner. The food is excellent in both taste and plating. Good atmosphere and friendly staffs, really a wonderful experience."

Ristorante Uliassi,50,amazing and luxury,"amazing presented dinner ! fully recommended, but expensive ! It is very nice restaurant with specila eye on details!"

Ristorante Uliassi,50,Above and beyond,"One day I’ll die. But that day I’ll be less sad since in this short period of time, which we call life, I had the opportunity to eat at Uliassi!! (Classic 23)"

Ristorante Uliassi,50,Well deserved place in the top 59 restaurants in the world,An upmarket and exciting 3 Michelin star restaurant where the staff are so welcoming and service is faultless. The food is very complex and stretches your palate and is a must visit . Full of flavour and locally sourced .

Ristorante Uliassi,50,Superb seafront location. Delicious food that was like a sensory explosion in your mouth. Exceptional service.,"Dined here for lunch and were lucky enough to be seated on the terrace overlooking the beach and the water. Choice of three degustation menus or the A La Carte. The degustation menus were the almost entirely seafood based Classic, which was 10 courses plus amuse bouche, bread and petit fours for Euro230 per person. The Easy Classic which was six courses chosen by Chef and Owner Mauro Uliassi for Euro 200 per person or the Game and Lab 2022, which was by reservation only, and was also Euro230 per person.    We chose the Classic which had a choice for the main of Sea or Game. In our case Sea Bass or pigeon. We chose the Sea Bass.    The amuse bouche consisted of a small refreshing drink plus foie gras and something else, maybe parsley?, spread on the plate. Then followed six starters raw red shrimp, mandarin and pineapple sage flowers, then sole with bergamot and lettuce, a squid skewer with icy citronette on the side, raw amberjack with tomatoes, basil, anchovies, capers and rocket, Marina marrowbone with codfish tripe and celery seeds plus an additional dish not on the menu, almond and sea urchin. There was a smorgasbord of flavours amongst these dishes with some needing an acquired taste eg the sea urchin and the marrowbone, which I am obviously still acquiring, but was very happy to taste.    There followed two pasta dishes one with tomato and an infusion of fig leaves the other being smoked spaghetti, clams and grilled cherry tomatoes. Both very enjoyable.    The main was Sea bass that was beautifully cooked and presented.    There followed a pre-dessert with coconut, fruit, gelato and meringue and dessert, for me the Senigallia Brest which was two pastries filled with gelato and other goodies, and for my wife a passionfruit soup, yoghurt gelato, pink pepper and candied banana.    The house baked bread selection, both normal and gluten free, was excellent and replaced on numerous occasions during the course of the meal.    Wine list was extensive with local, Italian and many foreign wines at different price points. We had a bottle of Jermaan Chardonnay for Euro100 and two glasses of Vermentino Euro15 each.    Frizzante was Euro6 per person with unlimited refills.    We finished with coffee (Euro6 per person) and a range of petit fours that came in a beautiful ceramic box.    Staff were exceptional. Professional, attentive and welcoming. Chef and owner Mauro Uliassi came out on four occasions to speak to us as well as the other guests. Mauro explained that he had been open for 33 years and had 22 chefs, 15 staff and 3 bottle washers.    Excellent dining experience."

Ristorante Uliassi,50,Perfection,"Some initial confusion given we had overlooked the instructions on their website (do not use Waze!) but we were promptly directed.  A few days prior I made a request, without much hope, for a Seaview table. Much to my surprise we were assigned one of the coveted tables on the terrace. At lunchtime, the mild breeze added to the experience.    We opted for the classic set menu, which was a superb 11-course affair (6 starters, 2 pastas, one main to choose from either fish or game) and 2 desserts, plus amuse bouche and petit fours. The fish quality was outstanding and each dish was packed with a variety of subtle flavours, with an emphasis on citrus fruit. Presentation was a work of art.    Courses were extremely very well paced and service was prompt and polished; top-ups were constant.    The Chef made a couple of appearances alongside his sister to greet and check on tables. Both were laid-back and charming.    This an exquisite overall experience and I really can't fault any aspect of it."

Ristorante Uliassi,50,"Must stop in the region: superb place, recommended","PROS Excellent food Excellent service Lab menu was pure genius Rightly priced CONS Pairing below expectations but overall very good Ranked 12nd in the World 2022, no much to add: highly recommended"

Ristorante Uliassi,50,Awe inspiring food and service,"Ok , so this is one expensive gig by anyone’s standard. €750 lunch for 3 with two bottles of wine at the more modest end of the spectrum .  Strangely enough it is fabulously good value . The food , clearly labour intensive in the preparation , is second to none . Beautiful combinations of flavours and equally beautifully presented . The service is seamlessly efficient whilst being completely unpretentious and unfussy . It’s my second visit there and I’ll be back as soon as my bank account is replenished."

Ristorante Uliassi,10,A disappointing experience,"A group of us visited for lunch. It was a beautiful sunny day. Unfortunately we were put in a side room with frosted windows. It was hot and stuffy with no view of the sea or the beach. By contrast the main area was light and cool with a view. The service was very intrusive. Waiters hovered all the time, brushing the tablecloth repeatedly, removing and replacing plates and cutlery, filling glasses and so on. Why not just leave the bottle on the table and leave me alone? I felt uncomfortable the moment I walked in and this feeling never left me. The idea seemed to be to create a sort of theatrical experience in which I was expected to take part. It was all about presentation rather than taste. The idea seemed to be to make the meal into a drama and the concept that it was about eating in good company was lost. I remember what it looked like but the taste has faded from my memory. When we finally left (the meal was far too long) it was a relief to take off my shoes and walk down the beach into the sea. A simple pleasure in contrast to all the artifice I had been subjected to."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Out of the ordinary.,Different vibe…which was refreshing. Conscientious service with a variety of flavors. We did it all and we’re out the door at midnight. So fun! What a wonderful memory we made while visiting Milan.

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,40,Not worth of 2 stars,"This is an old restaurant, 60 years old, and they are often difficult. They may have a fantastic history, but time passes faster and the heavy load doesn’t allow it to keep up.  This is not a bad restaurant, of course. Food was tasteful, it looked good and was served nicely. Sommelier was very good too. Wine list was extensive, as you could expect.  Everything was good but nothing was very good. Service was also a little joyless."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Wonderful food experience!,Wonderful experience in Italy. We have been a table of 6 persons and everything was sesational they have good wine's and a great food experience congratulations.

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,30,Disappointing,"Having booked this restaurant several months in advance, we were looking forward to our visit whilst here in Milan.  We had dined at Seta two nights ago & had a fabulous time so expectations were high for this.    Sadly the atmosphere was poor; everything just felt a little forced.  Advertised as ""bright restaurant with abstract art works""; the reality was, a plain white room with little ambience or any points of interest.    The food was good, but lacking in that extra but of magic I expect from a 2 star.    Service lacked in personality, whilst everything was done ""correctly,"" it did mean we were often with empty glasses whilst we waited for the ""correct"" person to come & pour it.    Would we return...... no."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,A truly lovely time,The venue is very beautiful and refined/minimal but natural as well. The value was excellent and there are a lot of finds on the wine list which we had excellent help from the sommelier. Everything we had was absolutely superb and the service was courteous and attentive and friendly.  They offer 3 different tasting menus to choose from. They also have a wine menu/pairing option as well.

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,40,Well executed tasting menu taking you around the regions of Italy,This tasting menu truly reflected so many various regions and cuisines in each dish. I was pregnant and they were very accommodating to my dietary preferences. My husbands dishes looked incredible and the wine pairings were very interesting from what he told me. My favorite dishes was the land and sea risotto. Each preparation was creative yet delicious and although very modern in execution the flavors were interesting yet familiar enough that I would want to eat many of the dishes again. We were here during COVID and in between Christmas and New Years and the service was still very friendly and attentive.

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,10,Avoid,"Insufficient in most aspects: food, interior, service. Most food is dull and rather tasteless (only classic italian dishes like spaghetti and ravioli were good). service is ok, but somehow strange. the interior is depressing and unspectacular. No windows. the only really good thing to mention is the wine pairing and the sommelier, which we were very happy with. all this at a price of 800 EUR for 2 is just unacceptable."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,40,Always a pleasure,"Still going strong since the retirement of esteemed Aimo and Nadia although understand daughter Stefania is still involved. Chef of some 20 years and part owner, Negrini, is indeed talented, outstanding were the Liver Pate flavored with white truffle and cocoa also the Fassona breed Young Beef, less so was Tortelli filled with Piedmontese ossobuco marrow and Parmigiano a tad too heavy for this stage of the proceedings when one would have preferred a lighter more delicate filling, perhaps something that could be worked on together with the room now a bit sparse the wonderful abstract artworks having been removed, hopefully temporarily !"

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,30,Average food and service,"I dislike writing mediocre reviews, but we left very disappointed after spending over $1000. Perhaps this was an off night, but for a 2 star Michelin Restraunt, we expected a high level of service and exceptional food.    When we arrived, we had difficulty choosing between the 2 set menus (Classic vs Autumn) When we asked the waiter for guidance, he replied the Autumn with no explanation. We thought it was a bit strange, but said fine since he was so quick in his decision making.    As we sat at our table, we noticed the energy of the servers to be a bit chaotic. Our server was literally running across the restaurant. Then, we saw a server drop an oyster appetizer on the floor. You simply don’t see this in a Michelin star restraunt.    The food was good, but not outstanding. When we got to the risotto dish, the server showed us the truffles, but then took it away. We thought it a bit odd. We realized after we ate it that he forgot to put it on our dish! Everyone around us had truffles shaved onto the risotto. Even if it cost extra, he did not ask if we wanted it.    At dessert, the waiter dropped the cream puff onto the table and her finger went into to dish. She brought us another. If this was just an average restaurant, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But, we were simply expecting a higher level of service and food quality.    We only had 2 days to eat at Michelin starred restaurants on this trip as high end restaurants are closed on Sundays and Mondays. I wish we had picked another. With so many delicious restaurants to chose from in Milan, I hope this review can help other travelers. It may just have been an off night. But if you are going to spend $1000, you should chose wisely."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,fantastico,"comfort delicious italian food, perfect for family Still miss aimo e nadia ... when we saw them there"

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Fully deserves its two stars,"Fully deserves its two Michelin stars. I had suckling pig served six ways preceded by perfect pasta with lobster. My wife enjoyed snails with lentils and crispy red mullet. Service was amazing. A wonderful culinary evening, worth the money. Not a restaurant for every day, of course."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Exceptional !,"One of my favourite places in Italy! It is rewarded by 2 Michelin Stars. You will find here perfect service, excellent food, and modern elegant interior. Tasting menu is a must to try. Each dish looks like piece of art. There is also vast selection of the best wines. I will definitely be back there as often as I can. Magnificent!"

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Loved every bite,"I had dinner at ""Il luogo di Aimo e Nadia"" with my wife. The place is very family like and quite welcoming. Not at all fancy like other 2 star Michelin rated restaurants might be. As far as I am concerned, it's a positive thing.  We were advised the ""Il Luogo Delights"" tasting menu and it didn't disappoint. Every plate was an expression of true passion and love for food. We enjoyed every single moment of our dining experience which did last over 4 hours.    Thank you"

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,30,Disappointing food and luke warm service,"Reputed to be one of the best and 'in"" fine dining modern italian restaurants in Milan. We found it disappointing. Food was 'ok', the ingredients were certainly high quality but the cooking style wasn't particularly interesting or tasty. More show than go. The time between some dishes was unacceptably long. We had the multi course degustation and had to wait 25-30min for some courses. Service (to us anyway) was standard but not warm or genuine, as compared to the very pleasant service given to the adjoining table who were locals. Thats fine, but its not fine if they ordered a taxi for us but no one bothered to inform us the taxi had already been waiting outside for a long time (and racking up waiting charges)."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,The restaurant isn’t sign,"The restaurant isn’t sign posted, but the Michelin Star plaque on the wall was a good indication that it was likely we were at the right place. Once we were finally allowed out of the cold and into the restaurant for our 7pm dinner booking, we were warmly greeted and politely asked to wait a little longer while the vaccum cleaner hummed away in another room. It felt strangely like we’d arrived at a dinner party too early and the hosts weren’t quite ready for us. It wasn’t long before we were lead to an intimate room of four tables set for 4 couples and one by one each couple arrived as we absorbed our minimalist “Bewitched meets the Brady Bunch”- like surroundings. Waiters came and went in a clockwork-like dance around the tables, gracefully placing fresh cutlery and delivering delicate dishes and matching wines from polished silver trays. All dishes meticulously presented and tasting superb with perfectly matched wines. Amazing.  A wonderful experience overall, and would definitely recommend, but a strangely uncomfortable robot-like vibe from the staff. All very friendly and helpful, but something just didn’t seem quite right."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Worth to try while in Milan,Nice dining experience from starters to deserts Good dishes Great Service Nice setting A little bit pricey

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,10,2 Michelin stars?? 😀😀😀😀very,2 Michelin stars?? 😀😀😀😀very funny! Try this place and you will understand what i am talking about. Me and my girl we just had a bih laugh. Bravo !

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,40,"Superb experience, but no Italy",We were told it is the best dining experience in Milan. We confirm: the food was amazing and deserves Two Michelin stars. The place is very well designed.  However the cuisine bears no connection to Italy. Such restaurant could have been anywhere in the world.  There is an atmosphere of business there. Our sommelier was always looking at the next table when was finishing to pour wine to us. Why rush?

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,A truly amazing gastronomic experience,A truly amazing gastronomic experience. Impeccable service and high quality and creative food as you would expect from a 2 ** Michelin.

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Incredible!,Absolutely amazing experience. Dinner was spectacular and the Sommelier was exceptional; pairing our meal with amazing wines throughout the meal. eeexcincredible wine wit

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,An unforgettable culinary experience,"This is a special restaurant with a palpable passion for food and attention to detail. Clearly, enormous work goes into every aspect of every dish, from sourcing the very best ingredients, to testing combinations of flavours, and providing service that is immersive and anticipates every need in advance. Whether you are an aficionado of fine dining or new to the concept, this restaurant is an unmissable experience."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Beautiful experience,"Whenever in Milan, you should pay them a visit. An excellent service and exceptional dishes. Staff were attentive to had an eye to the tiniest detail."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,"World class cuisine, understated ambience","My wife and I have visited several Michelin restaurants over the years, but this ranks with the best.    We had the Autumn tasting menu. Everything was excellent especially the Mussel entree, & veal ravioli with truffle.    Although the place was full, it was not overly noisy. Service was efficient, in a nice and understated way.    Prices for the Menu Degustatione at 140 Euros per person was reasonable.    Only thing is Restaurant is a good 1/2 hour ride away from the city center, in a nondescript suburb.    Highly Recommended"

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Premier Choice for an Outstanding Experience,"This restaurant is worth visiting. The attention to customers is top notch, the food of the highest quality and presentation, and the table service orchestrated seamlessly for an elegant and refined evening.  The wine list is complete but fairly expensive with very few less expensive offerings.  The only knock i would give it is the lighting is too bright. Dimmer room lighting would be appreciated. The “book” lighting for each table is fun, practical and a touch of glamor, but the room lighting took away from the overall ambiance for us. We ate in the first larger room, in the centre, and the table was perfect otherwise, despite the presence of many other patrons.  The restaurant is entered from the small and locked Relais Chateau door and there does not seem to be signage for the Restaurant which confused us and other patrons arriving."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Masterful Cooking,"Absolutely one of the best meals we’ve ever had, this restaurant is totally worthy of it’s Michelin stars. All the dishes were perfectly executed and impeccably presented, with a few pleasant flavour surprises along the way.    When we first walked into the stuffy dining room we definitely felt underdressed and a little uncomfortable but the friendly staff, particularly the sommelier soon made us feel relaxed and very welcome despite clearly not being big spenders - which a lot of Michelin star establishments fail to do.    The only small error by the service was to remove a lovely bit of homemade bread from the table which I had been saving to mop up sauces with whilst I wasn’t looking (very sneaky!)    My only criticism of the restaurant is the dining room itself. In my opinion too brightly lit, plain and lacking background music which results in a complete lack of atmosphere and feeling like one has to whisper and be cautious of how loud you chew your food."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,World class food and service,If your travels bring you to Milan this is a must visit restaurant. Plan ahead to make a reservation. The tasting menu is as good as any you will find in the world. Clients include locals and tourist alike - which speaks volumes to the dining experience you will have. Excellent wine list and Sommelier to match. The wait staff is attentive and pleasant.

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,First Class Gourmet Restaurant,"This restaurant has been at the top of the lists in Milan for more than half a century and it fully deserves to be there. Here you will experience impeccable Italian service. The atmosphere is elegant, modern Italian design. There are three rooms. We ate in the first. It is the largest with at most ten tables, all well spaced out so you can enjoy your privacy. The second room seemed rather small and the third had its own private kitchen. It seemed like a great room for a special event. We ordered the classic tasting menu, Le Delizie del Luogo. There were more than ten dishes, all fairly small, all excellent. The risotto with mussels was particularly good. The tasting menu is a great way to discover the full range of the chef’s talent. Highly recommended for those in search of the ultimate, upscale Italian dining experience."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,One of our finest dining experiences!,"I chose this restaurant from one of my favorite food bloggers and noticed Giada also recommends. This restaurant is nothing short of a masterpiece. Everything down to the water glasses, art of the menu, etc is so carefully thought out. Every bite had so much flavor. The staff was very attentive, from the servers, to the somm even the maitre-d. We decided to go with one of the prix fixes menus but there is also al a carte. This is most definitely not casual and would definitely only visit on special occasions. Very expensive but worth it for the food and overall experience."

Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia,50,Absolutely amazing,My partner took me here for our anniversary. It was amazing from start to finish. We order a few items but were pleasantly surprised with a few “presents” and “surprises” before our meal came out. They made sure everything was perfect. We witnessed another table not being able to eat something due to allergies and they brought another dish without hesitations.    Loved it :)

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,10,Don't fall for it,"This was the worst meal I had on a 9 day trip to Italy and the worst fine dining experience I’ve had in my life. I have never before left a review on this site, but the experience was so bad, I had to write my first.    On many negative fine dining reviews, I often wonder “does the reviewer just not like fine dining?”. That is not the case here. I don’t eat at 3 star places every week, but tend to go to one a year and generally love the taste and creativity shown at these restaurants.    First, let’s talk about setting. If you imagine “globally homogeneous generic fine dining” you have the picture. The interior was elegant but bland. The neighborhood has the grunge of an artsy area with the boredom of a family-centric area. The museum has a tacky video ad for the restaurant in the lobby.    A sterile distance exists between the guests while somehow providing none of the privacy benefits this should afford. If you are in one of the middle tables, you can overhear almost every other table as guests try to justify their meal’s expense and reassure each other that the food is in fact good (despite what their taste buds tell them).    The staff buzz about with an awkward self-consciousness that puts one in mind of millennial art school dropouts. You feel watched, but not in a comforting way. Even placing plates down in a coordinated manner is an awkward stuttered dance. I found myself rooting for my server several times as they struggled to explain a dish.    But what about the food? To summarize, it was bad, but sometimes bad in creative ways. Not “bad for the money” or “not as good as I hoped”, but legitimately not enjoyable. Creativity is important, and the chef is certainly creative at times. Unfortunately, this is done at the cost of taste. Each course ended with us saying “that’s interesting”, which is faint praise. At a restaurant like this, you should be inadvertently smiling after your first bite, you should be sad that each portion is so small, you should be holding back moans of pleasure - and then you should appreciate the creativity. Here, the occasional creativity is all the food has to stand on. Let’s go through some highlights:  - The most tasteless foie gras in Europe  - Almost crunchy risotto with Gorgonzola fit for a microwave dinner  - Umami flavored gels and jellies (which I would have found more interesting if I had never had a tasting menu before)  - Boring cheese sticks  - Chef Boyardee-inspired tomato soup (with admittedly tasty dumplings)  - Grain bread with butter that is somehow bitter  - Forgettable beef with tough and bland cow's heart    After many courses of pretending to enjoy the food for my benefit, my wife looked at the clock slowly ticking, leaned in and whispered “am I being tortured?” We laughed as both of us finally admitted to the other that we were having a miserable time. Like fraternity brothers during pledge week, we found solace in each other and our bond was strengthened as we braced ourselves for the final dishes. Perhaps this moment was the chef’s real goal all along.    Wine was good. Dessert was fine.    In summary, absolutely avoid this restaurant."

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,30,"Fine for the beef, Tortellini and the service quality.","On the one hand, the service quality is perfect and it is impossible to fine any problems from this part. They always try to take care me and recommend wine depending on how a guest thinks such as going to airport tomorrow maybes.  On the other,the main course such as beef and the sauce of Tortellini is excellent"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Arrive hungry and budget lots of time,"Like most three-star Michelins, this restaurant was definitely over-the-top. Service was excellent and there were designated people for everything – bread, utensils, water, etc.    There were multiple options for dining - two tasting menus or picking 3 or 4 courses from anywhere on the menu. We did four courses, which was perhaps a mistake since the portion sizes were larger than with a tasting menu. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed and slightly miserable from all the food.    Expect a long dinner – budget 3-4 hours minimum because in addition to your selection (tasting menu or otherwise), you will receive the following:  a) a “chef’s welcome” - a selection of around five little tidbits from raw fish to a lovely little mini taco and finished with this ridiculous canape that was beef pate rolled into a ball and then covered in edible gold leaf to make it look like a Ferrero Rocher ball,  b) an amuse-bouche. Ours was a zucchini theme (3 different tastes – my favorite was the zucchini ice cream),  c) various selections of bread, and  d) an overly large selection of petit fours after the dessert course placed on glass figurines (bees, butterflies, etc).    Finally, as you leave, you receive a lovely keepsake menu of your main (chosen) courses – with our favorites as the homemade “bee” pasta, striped to look like bees and in a honey-based sauce and the smoked Sila potato (basically gnocchi) filled with sausage and cheese with a side of shrimp."

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Amazing food and a really cool atmosphere.,"Amazing tasting menu. Food was what I would expect of a top-tier place in Italy and the service was impeccable. We did a wine pairing which was also very well paired. We particularly enjoyed the ""black glass"" wine guessing game and the dinner ware (including the glass animals) was a very nice touch. Not something I usually notice, but the art at this place was also really interesting. Felt like it really added to the overall vibe of the place and I actually spent some time seriously looking at it."

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,SUPERNATURAL EXPIRIENCE,"I traveled 9,515 km to go to this restaurant, and it doesn't deserve any of its Michelin stars. This restaurant was definitely the worst gastronomic experience I've ever had. I suffered from food poisoning caused by the most appalling dishes I've had the displeasure of eating, and I truly had a supernatural experience; I felt sick and thought I was going to die. The bread smells like cigarettes, as does the ravioli. The dishes may look great, but they taste horrible. Don't eat anything at all. I spent the price of a rent on a meal that not even Guantánamo prisoners would dare to savor. The restaurant takes too long between courses. It's not worth the fortune they charge. The food is truly terrible. I had to soften my opinion because the platform removed my comment, even though I was just warning that this restaurant is a scam. Don't trust the other reviews. You've been warned. The only good thing about this restaurant is the service, but it's not worth the food poisoning. I hope someone from the restaurant reads this comment and notifies the chef that he is a fraud."

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Simply without equal. Superb!,"Incredible food. But just go for a couple of plates rather than the degustation menu since even though the portions are small, you won’t manage it. A true gem and a food lover paradise. The flavours, ingredients, combinations are just supreme"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,30,Disappointed,"Last September, I visited Milan and decided to dine at the much-celebrated Ristorante Enrico Bartoli and ended up regretting it. To begin with, the ambiance was not pleasant. The dining room looked more like a warehouse than a 3-Micheline star restaurant. The meal in general lacked focus. Some of the dishes looked different but tasted the quite similar. The highlight of the evening was the staff. They were all efficient and polite.    Whenever I return to Milan, again. I will go back to Seta, where basically for the same money, the food is delicious and very imaginative."

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Simply without equal. Superb!,"This was our first 3 Michelin star dining experience in my wife's home city. In a word ""wow"". This was, by some margin, one of the standout meals I have ever had. It was without equal. The cooking skill on display is really quite special, backed up by a level of service and attention to detail that just underlines why Chef Bartolini is the cooking rock star he is. Superb and highly recommended!"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,The Pinnacle of Northern Italian Fine Dining - Truly Exceptional,"A truly excellent meal, wine pairing, and service from 3* Michelin Chef Enrico Bartolini and the staff at his Ristorante on the top floor of Milan’s Museo delle Culture. The chef’s elevated, unique, flavorful and visually stunning creations takes classical Italian cuisine to a whole new level. The welcome bites and after dessert treats were both plentiful and tasty. There were too many favorites from the meal to pick a favorite. It was much appreciated added personal touch when Chef Bartolini visited each table and chatted with the guest. The sommelier’s wine pairings were inspired and a perfect match. What a treat!!!"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Enrico is a star!!!,"First time visit for us and husband and will return and hopefully very soon! great place and amazing employees, very nice restaurant and we were treated very well. conversation with waiters employees was very nice restaurant was not too busy. meals were excellent and we were helped to select an extrardinary wine. GREAT! could not be better"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,A triple threat in a good way,"Ambiance. Service. Food (and wine). Three attributes that are hard to fulfill simultaneously at a high level but this restaurant did so impeccably. Our dinner here was the highlight of our food oriented visit to Italy. There was a cool, simple, and modern vibe to the restaurant. The service was on point and delightful. Our lead waitstaff was lovely and the sommelier was informative and personable. Aiyiyi. And the food. Staggeringly beautiful, fresh, creative, accessible, truly delicious, and fun. While we still opted for the full tasting menu, the restaurant does offer 3 and 4 course choices from the menus. We loved this place. It was an incredible evening. Complimenti and bravissimi to the chef and staff!"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Absolute perfection,"Wow! What an experience.  It’s a wonderful location on the top floor of the Mudec museum with only few tables, maybe 10-12 in total.  The two of us chose the Mudec experience and we were not disappointed. The food was absolutely delicious, starting with the bread up until the very end. The pasticcini we got to go because we were to full to enjoy them there.  The combination of flavors is just out of this world. The staff was very attentive, polite and kind. And Mr Bertolini came out twice and took the time to chat with each table and take pictures.  It could not have been better!"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Our first experience,Our first time and the only words I can say is AMAZING. Plenty food and the most important thing is quality and service. Highly recommended

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,One of our best meals on our trip!,"A step above the rest! This meal was exceptional from the first bite the the last. Creative, yet delicious. My pet peeve is going to high end restaurants and having interesting food, but not delicious food. It is located on the 3rd floor in a museum. Nice ambiance, impeccable service. One of the best meals we had on our trip!"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,An experience,I have been 3 times in this restaurant and yes the stars are well earned From the check in towards the food route all was just great Had a beautiful moment of joy and surely will come back Thank you

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,The very very best of Italy,"We came here to celebrate my anniversary . Needless to say a friend pulled some strings to get us a table and it was all made as a surprise and boy was it one. Let’s start with the service who we fell in love with. Everyone made the experience memorable. The food is divine. Not more to say. The chef is multi Michelin star decorated and rightly so. The various dishes were so inventive and yet comporting , one dish revealed a wiff of smoke to compliment an elegant beetroot , and the sommelier was generous with offers though we are not big in drinking .. yet kindly offered a 1967 red treasure to try . I felt so special and welcomed from the moment you come in.  If you have a chance and no connections to get a tacle(lol) reserve way in advance. The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of the museum . This was with vespetine in LA a Michelin experience that is worth every penny . Highly recommended"

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,amazing,"as we arrived some minutes before 12.30h and no restaurant staff was around yet to give us way to the elevator to the restaurant, we had to wait and the museum staff was very kind to let us see they're collection with our girls for free. finaly we were greeted by the the very friendly staff and welcomed to the beautiful restaurant. we had a great table with plenty of daylight which made the nice design with the artworks even more fascinating. our girls (4 and 8 years) were treated very kindly and they enjoyed their special menu. we decided to go with the most possible options for our menu and were amazed with everything. perfect from start to finish. fantastic staff and nice wine (winelist on the pricier side). hope to return as soon as possible."

Ristorante Enrico Bartolini,50,Perfection,"Enrico Bartolini made our one night in Milan very memorable. This was my first time dining at a 3 Michelin Star, and the experience was perfect and I hope to return one day!    Atmosphere:  1) Love the decor, it feels chic and modern.  2) Very intimate, with only 8 tables  3) I can't speak for everyone but I would have appreciated some music, it was extremely quiet, and made me hesitant to speak  4) Enrico himself came out to thank all the tables, and we got to chat with him briefly. He was super kind and this definitely was a nice touch!    Food:  1) Absolutely phenomenal; the plating, taste, and presentation  2) We had the 10 course tasting menu and it was more than enough. It ended up being 14-15 courses in the end.  3) Everything was so delicious, I don't know what more to say! It was just perfect.    Service:  1) You can tell their staff has had extensive training as they are all in sync with one another. (Setting cutlery, plates at the same time)  2) Very attentive  3) They were all very knowledgeable on all the dishes"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Excellent Lunch,"My wife and I had lunch here. We were glad we came for lunch instead of dinner as the meal lasted approximately 4 hours.    Given that the building is pretty old I was surprised how modern and sharp looking the interior was. It’s very stylish with various framed posters and artwork throughout the building. We had an interesting poster of Tyrone Power as Zorro overlooking our table.    The restaurant has several different meal options. We had the choice of a la carte, classic tasting menu, surprise menu and a game menu. We chose the surprise menu which provided some flexibility in terms of choosing the main dish. I ordered hare from the game menu while my wife chose beef.    We had 8 dishes plus a bonus dish of sweets at the end. The vast majority of the dishes were outstanding with an emphasis on high-end ingredients like white truffles, foie gras and lobster. There were a lot of highlights but my personal favorite was the cheese cart. It consists of approximately 40 cheeses and you can choose as many as you want. I was also blown away by their breads - a huge variety and uniformly excellent. It was probably the best bread I’ve ever had.    The only dish we didn’t care for was a scallop dish. The sauce was too thick for our liking. Also, the desserts were a mixed bag. A few were excellent but several were bland.    Service was tremendous. They have a large staff and all were friendly and helpful. We also talked to the chef and his wife (separately) towards the end of the meal which was a nice touch.    Overall we had a great lunch - one that Tyrone Power would surely approve of. I’d love to return and try their game menu some day."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Foodies Rejoice!,"This restaurant is good for a romantic evening or celebration. The restaurant has several rooms, each to denote a different tone.    We liked the fact that, whilst no music, you couldn't overhear patrons.    The chef came out at the end of the meal, and we had a great conversation with him. We spoke to him about his appreciation of textures and combining ingredients we wouldn't have expected. And then there's the cheese board with at least 15-20 cheeses."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Great food but service was surprisingly lacking,"We have dined here on a number of previous occasions and on the whole the food has always delivered with beautifully plated dishes comprising lots of different elements that showcase a vast array of techniques and are all brought together by deep, complex sauces.    This restaurant has always delivered cooking at the highest level, and that was no different on this visit, although given it was winter rather than spring or summer, the seasonal menu was never going to be quite as strong without all of the fresh seasonal produce that one can enjoy later in the year. That said, the food didn't disappoint, other than perhaps the pre-dessert which felt a bit too one dimensional, tasting primarily of passion fruit.    The biggest disappointment was the service. In a 3 star restaurant one would expect to be served by someone who can explain each of the key elements in the dishes. Whilst our waiter may have been able to do this, he could not do it in English. Language barriers have never been an issue when dining here before. He apologised for his lack of English, however, his manager should have either asked someone else to serve us or arranged some sort of workaround.    When you are paying upwards of four figures for dinner for two in a three star restaurant, this is not acceptable. The diner needs to know that they have more than meat and sauce on the plate. This waiter was also somewhat inexperienced and when deboning fish tableside (a nice touch of theatre) he dropped a piece rather inelegantly on the board. At this level, precision matters. Equally, a number of dishes sat around waiting to be served for longer than they should have done. Again, at this level, this is not acceptable.    In recent years, there have been a lot of new faces on the front of house team, which is great, but the management need to ensure that standards are still being maintained, and indeed should always be looking to improve things further. We are looking forward to returning at the start of the summer, and hope that the service issues will have been ironed out by then."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Great Cooking School@3 star restaurant,I joined this famous restaurant’s one day cooking school. It was fabulous. The world class chef Franck Giovannini greeted us ( super welcoming btw!) in the restaurant kitchen where we could see everything that is behind the scenes in 3 star dining.  We spent the next 7 hours learning many dishes upstairs in the schools intimate kitchen ( 5 people maximum) with one of his very accomplished and detailed chefs. We ate each dish just after we prepared it and then continued with the next one. A break to go back down to be in the main kitchen during the height of lunch so we could see more action. They sent us home w recipes and a parting gift not to mention a new awareness of all that goes into this pinnacle level of food and experience!  Loved it!!!

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,20,Bad surprise,"Having chosen the Gastronomic menu as it lokked very interesting and in order to taste a bit of everything, we were disappointed. There was no equilibrium in any of the dishes, Always one thing that overtook the taste of the other things. Very unpleasant foie gras, taste as well as consistancy. This was unfortunately a great dissappointment for all of us ( 4 persons). The staff was not very kind or professional either. We had to ask to get the bread, ask to get the water several times. A shame, won't be going back."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Exellent exellent exellent,"For my husbands 80th birthday we took our whole family for dinner to Crissier ! We had a menu it was exellent very balanced and not too much, the light deserts refreshing ! Chef Giovannini very modest hard working congratulation !"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Absolutely Spectacular,"We are fortunate to have dined at numerous 3* Michelin establishments, so have many other restaurants notionally at the same level from which to form the basis of a robust benchmark. L'Hotel de Ville is always a treat as the cuisine is classical - classical is without question our preference over completely contemporary nordic style - and the dishes are exquisitely presented.    Even with our high expectations based on previous visits, the restaurant really managed to excel themselves. We had their longest tasting menu which comprised dish after dish packed full of flavour, clever textures, perfect seasoning, and beautifully arranged components. It is relatively unusual to have a long tasting menu where every dish is of the same level as there are often misses here and there; this was hit after hit after hit.    Every little detail had been thought about and unlike in so many of the contemporary style restaurants, hot food here is just that, served hot. The service is friendly, informative and above all, delivered with a real passion and pride for the product. This is what, as a diner, I want to see. The cheese trolley must have had over 40 different types of cheese from which generous portions were served; exemplarary. In fact, the whole experience here is one that feels very generous and is more than worth the price point.    The quality of the technique and skill shown in every single dish has to be experienced to be believed. If I had to recommend just one 3* Michelin restaurant, without question, L'Hotel de Ville would be my suggestion; quite simply, food does not really get better than this."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Excellente Service,The Setting is Great the Food fabulons and the Food just delicious. It is always à pleasure to go back there

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Charmed in Crissier,"What else is there to say about a gastronomic experience at this Michelin 3 star gem in the unassuming town of Crissier?    One could wax lyrical about the quaint ambience of the hotel (the house of a previous mayor if I caught that right). We we so blessed to chance upon an available slot where the 9 of us were accorded a private room (otherwise booked full each day, as we were told). The room was simply decorated, the tableware minimalistically elegant. And we had a round table (which allowed for maximum engagement as a group).    And do we need to mention the menu which was eight courses of delectable delights, surprise after surprise, unfolding like the plot of an intriguing adventure novel. If I had to pick a top three, it would be the scallops with caviar, the truffles on a foam of leek and the langoustines and artichoke. Tough choices.    A strong ending is a given, with a wide array of cheese to select from, and two incredible desserts - a blood orange cocktail and a special apple tart.    We needn’t highlight the warm service professional, down to the coordination of the plates landing in front of us. Our server also recommended a Swiss Bordeaux and a Swiss Merlot to complete the experience.    All in all, an amazing experience that will long remain.    Top tip: get a few friends and book the private room with a round table!"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,40,"Good, but not as good as Anne Sophie Pic in Lausanne","We were lucky to dine at Hotel de Ville Crissier and in Anne Sophie Pic in Lausanne in the span of 2 weeks. We liked the Hotel de Ville but ASP left a more lasting, ""wow"" impression on us. At HDV the flavours were simpler and less surprising, the decor of the room and the tableware was simpler, and HDV was more expensive. Cardoons with truffle was our favourite dish, the most subtle and exciting combination of flavours. At HDV the chef came in and spoke to every table, but the conversation was very brief and not really engaging (he spoke longer with French-speaking guests). Overall, nice and good, but not great and memorable like ASP."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,What else...it's an experience,Writing in English because not enough comments!  My my my.... the place is gorgeous but the food.....it's just impressive.  Without a doubt it deserves its 3 stars and all the titles it has.  It's a journey through gastronomy.... yes you can have some ingredients that you might not like but even this doesn't matter. 4h wonderful with a team perfect.

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Exceptional game menu for a once in a lifetime experience,"Absolutely stunning.  I was lucky enough to get a table during the game season, and their game menu is impressive.  Seven different birds, some of which you will have trouble finding in other restaurants, including the exceptionally exclusive black grouse carved at your table (only on pre-order and upon availability), which I was incredibly lucky to taste. A once in a lifetime opportunity, at least in this part of the world, which if ordered will be the piece de resistance of your meal there.  To bring us to this amazing bird, we kindly asked the Maitre d' to advise us on starting dishes, so that it would build up nicely without anything overpowering it. He was most pleased to check in with Chef Franck Giovanni for a surprise menu that would achieve exactly that  The sommelier also did an amazing job, with a selection of both local and foreign wines, that paired nicely with each dishes.  Thanks a lot for Franck Giovanni and his team for this amazing experience, and to life which made me lucky enough to have the opportunity to eat there once.    https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g947015-d1015180-r813256862-Restaurant_de_l_Hotel_de_Ville_Crissier-Crissier_Lausanne_Canton_of_Vaud.html#"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,"As always, perfect food with perfect service",This is the only place where I can eat anything and I will never be disappointed. The surprise menu was perfect. The service is perfect. The place is wonderful too.

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Yup,"Only eaten at a 1 star before - to be honest, this was probably wasted on me. My poor palette cant distinguish between 1 Mstar and 3 Mstars    Anyways, had a fantastic time with the tasting menu, best dishes were the fish and the lobster    Drinks - also excellent - im not a wine person but the experience with the wine was fantastic    Dessert was good, but that was the only dish I wasnt blown away by!    Service was exceptional - really outstanding, very impressive    Its expensive, 2 people drinks and tasting menu 1200 CHF...    I wont come back, but if you can afford it, its delicious, really a once in a lifetime experience!"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,A dream that lived up to expectations,"We made a trip out to Switzerland just for l'Hotel de Ville Crissier and we were not disappointed. Service was amazing, the dishes were exquisite and overall we loved it.    Tip: don't stay in Crissier. Make the trip to Lausanne because Crissier is really a small town with absolutely nothing and Lausanne is pretty close, especially considering that you'll have to take a taxi to a hotel no matter how close the hotel since there is only freeway there"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,30,A RATHER DISAPPOINTING WEDDING ANNIVERSARY DINNER,"As the restaurant was fully booked for the actual date, we ended up settling for Friday, 11th June. The interior was welcoming, well lit and the tables well placed to give privacy as well as exuding warmth. We both opted for the Menu Découverte that had 8 dishes, priced at 315 CHF each. The serving of the aperitif started on a comical note; after introducing it’s provenance, the waitress attempted to pour it without realizing that the bottle was still corked!    We were asked what wine we would like with our menu. As it was a Menu Découverte, we asked the Sommelier to recommend a good red wine that in her opinion, would go well with the menu. We also mentioned that it should be fruity, with not too much tanin and a nice body. The wine was acidic, with no body at all and we ended up drinking this 180 CHF bottle (even at home I have better wines!). This time they remembered to uncork it but it didn’t stop them from spilling some of it on the table!    From the first to the 4th dish everything was perfect. Every dish had it’s character and color, one could taste every ingredient in it and it was a delight to the buds. The 5th dish was a disappointment: it was a kind of small Coquille Saint-Jacques, swimming in the same sauce we had for the 4th dish, which was fish. The sauce was too salty and didn’t go well with the seafood. The 6th dish was beef, cooked to perfection. The only problem: the sauce again….too salty and almost sticky in consistency. We ate the beef plain without the sauce, which was just perfect (what is this obsession with sauces!!!).    After the magnificent chariot of cheese, we had a pre-desert that could have wonderfully finished the meal in trio with a saffron ice-cream and raspberries. The main desert was interesting but we felt it was not as refined as the pre-desert.    My wife ordered a vervain tea to finish the meal. For a restaurant of this reputation, the infusion was a pathetic disgrace. The water was not hot enough for the leaves to properly give their aroma to it and the tea had almost no taste (She grows her own vervain at home so she knows what she’s talking about).    When the chef came to do his customary rounds of all the tables, we told him about the sauces that were too salty. He said: ah no, the sauces are not salty, they are ‘corsées’. Sorry but if by corsées he meant that they have a strong taste, this is the role of spices not salt. I was drinking so much water because of the sauces; a blunt proof that it was too salty. He then defensively said: ‘if it wasn’t to your taste, you should have just told me and I would have done it again’. So it was basically our fault, we didn’t open our mouths to tell the chef that he spoilt his sauce!!! For me, it should be perfect the first time round since this is a Michelin 3 Star restaurant……unless everyone eats with too much salt and don’t realize it anymore.    Sadly, it was not the meal nor the experience we were looking forward to….a major disappointment for the close to 900 CHF we paid."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,"Perfect experience, definitely","Perfect experience, definitely worth its 3 stars. The service was flawless, they asked us if we were in a hurry and we were. I did not feel rushed but also did not feel I had to wait. The wines they served (we wanted by the glass) were very good and matched the food. We took the tasting menu. Loved it, but wanted to underline the fish. I am very picky with the fish, often I don’t like it regardless of restaurant stars, but this one was perfect. As a last remark, a 3 stars restaurant in Switzerland will be expensive, but the quality/price ratio is very good."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Culinary excellence,"Well, this restaurant has 3 michelin stars, 19 points Gault&Millau, was elected a couple of years ago as the best restaurant in the world...what one can add to this.  It is really the excellence on so many aspects.  We had the chance to have the summer menu gastronomique by chef Giovannini and we enjoyed every single bite of every single dish. It was a very fresh menu, with lots of vegetables and seafood. The attention to details was spectacular, basically a piece of art.  Worth mentioning is also the fantastic cheese buffet with probably more than 100 different cheese types that you can choose. Another special mention goes to the wine cellar of the restaurant: simply spectacular.  Overall: it might not be the cheapest meal, but it is definitely worth every single penny! Amazing"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,PERFECT IN EVERYTHING,"Extremely sophisticated dishes, but not overdone; beautiful location, very friendly and helpful staff. If only I could go back more often"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Experience haute cuisine in perfection,"We expected nothing less than perfection when we ordered the most expensive menu in Switzerland, notably one of the most expensive countries in the world. And the equipe at Hotel de Ville in Crissier delivered perfection. The lunch started with delicios scallops in a white wine sauce. They were followed by the two best vegetable dishes I have ever tasted: First, peas with olive oil and caviar, then, green beans with eggs and bottarga. Although not vegetarian dishes per se, the vegetables definitely played the main role in these compositions. The fresh and intense taste of the ingredients was just undescribably good! The following mushroom, fish, lobster, and lamb dishes were not able to top these two highlights, but were also absolutely mouth-watering. After an eclectic choice of cheeses, and tasteful, crisp bread, the two desserts were not on the same level as the rest of the menu, being rather blunt combinations of fruit, ice cream and chocolate. All in all, however, the food we were able to taste that day was well worth the trip to Crissier!"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Amazing experience,"It has been a wonderful experience, all the attention to detail, the delicious food, a great wine list, and excellent service. We found it a bit expensive, but we are in Switzerland.Highly recommended."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Perfection.,"Very rarely to you ever have an 8 course tasting menu where every single dish is excellent. I’Hotel de Ville achieved this on my visit. The food was simply stunning.  This restaurant is epitome of Michelin 3* dining. We also met and spoke with chef Franck Giovannini who was a charming, friendly guy and incredibly passionate about his ingredients. Only the best will do.  Quite simply one of the best restaurants in the world."

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,High level of detail,Curated to the finest detail Good mix of local ingredients and sperimentation Dramatic service All tucked in an unassuming Swiss village location

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Culinary Experience,"The restaurant deserves three stars as it is not just a meal what you get, but also a culinary experience. The tasting menu included eight courses that were all extremely tasty and well-balanced. I also loved that the service and food were customised as they ask you for your food preferences at the beginning and then create a menu that suits you. A big thank you!"

Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville Crissier,50,Outstanding,"I absolutely wanted to eat, at least once in my life, at the Hôtel de Ville in Crissier.  And I was not disappointed!  It was the most delicious, delicate meal I have ever had.  Everything was perfect, so was the staff, who made us feel so welcome and relaxed.  I will never forget!  Thank you to the chef Franck Giovannini and his brigade."

Materia,10,DONT GO!,"Wow. Can I give negative starts? This was awful. We got the Kaleidoscope experience, the most expensive on the menu. All courses that were not on the “regular “ menu were awful. Most tasted like baby food or meant for someone who can’t chew. Some had extremely overpowering taste that killed any natural flavors. One waitress and one bus boy for the whole restaurant. Only bright spot was the sommelier. I can’t understand how this has a Michelin star, all good reviews must be from a la charge menu. Save yourself time and money don’t go."

Materia,40,Unique experiencew,"Very unique meal that we enjoyed overall. My husband and I did the vegetarian tasting menu.    This meal is definitely about the experience, trying new things/combination of flavors and appreciating different food forms. I would not come here if you are very hungry, want something hearty or a guaranteed filling meal.    We came for lunch, and there were only two other parties there so it was a quiet/peaceful meal. The service and staff were very friendly, and the meal started off with a delicious variety of amuse bouche. We then went through a 5-course meal, of which our favorite was the szechuan rasberry risotto. We were not big fans of the pepper and spinach dishes.    Overall, we enjoyed the experience and appreciated that they had a vegetarian menu."

Materia,50,Phenomenal restaurant,"An unassuming front on a side street hides a truly brilliant restaurant. Friendly efficient staff with a good command of the English language, super wine list and truly spectacular but simple fresh and flavorsome food.    We were staying at Villa D’este where the food is already excellent but this establishment shines brightly.    Do yourselves a favour and eat here."

Materia,50,Great vegetarian dinner,Wonderful set menu vegetarian option. Had ‘Green Power’ vegetarian tasting menu. Ordered bottle of 2016 ll Colle Brunello de Montalcino.

Materia,30,"If asked for a recommendation on this restaurant, I’d pass.","I find this review difficult to write since by and large I generally agree with the Michelin rating for a good, innovative, and quality dining experience. I’ve been to dozens of rated restaurants over the years, including several already on this trip to Italy, and I’d tell others to pass on this one. Although the setting was laid back and the service staff professional and attentive, the food was often a miss, not a hit. We chose the”Caleidoscopio” menu since it seemed to offer an opportunity to experience a variety of the chef’s culinary creations. And while the food was certainly creative and fresh, the tastes were often in conflict."

Materia,50,Most casual and warm Michelin level dining,"Our final dinner in Lake Como was at equally impressive 1* Materia in the town of Cernobbio, just a 20 minute drive from the Mandarin Oriental Lago di Como. Easily the most casual of all the Michelin restaurants at which we dined in Italy, but that didn’t in any way detract from the impressive flavors and incredible presentations — not to mention warm service. The whole pigeon was a first for us, and it was sublime. We loved it! Highly recommended."

Materia,50,Great highly recommend!,Wonderful unique food! Favorite was the bone marrow dessert. Also loved the seafood salad - as the server said every bite is unique with different seafood.

Materia,20,They take themselves WAY too seriously. Underwhelming at best,"Very nice staff, and stuffy. Portions are miniscule, as if unusual fixings made very small make them special. They are not. I know fresh and excellent seafood. The fish from the lake is tasteless, and the sauces they provide cannot make the fish taste any better. The monkfish was bland and dry. Poor selection of wine by the glass. Even when the restaurant was pretty full, you could almost hear a pin drop. Seemed like nobody was really enjoying themselves as compared to a robust Italian restaurant full of life and laughter."

Materia,40,Innovative and interesting,"The food is certainly interesting and challenging in some cases - however, everything was cooked well and beautifully presented and we enjoyed every bite. We did the 7 course tasting menu and of course we had our favourites - the lake trout in trout consommé was the best trout I’ve ever had, the linguini with mango peel and lake fish was fantastic, the amuse-Bouche at the beginning were superb (and particularly the panna cotta with wasabi and soy, mind blowing). Other courses were also good - the pigeon, the sea urchin with cow brain dust, the red cabbage with caviar.  We also ordered a really excellent bottle of wine for 45 euros from a very decent wine list.  The place is relatively small - has 8-10 tables only. Service started and ended well, but dropped off a cliff in the middle. All the dishes were explained in detail, but there was an hour in the middle of the meal where we only received 2 courses. They seemed busy and backed up. By the end of the meal, all our glasses were empty and nobody asked if we wanted a refill of any kind. Shame, otherwise would have been 5 stars as the food was excellent. Still would recommend though, the chef obviously cares about the food that he puts out and it was a lovely evening overall. Also, 95 euros for 7 courses plus amuse-bouches and an extra dessert round is very acceptable for a 1 star Michelin restaurant"

Materia,40,Stumbled upon this restaurant,"My husband and I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking the streets of Cernobbio at 20:00pm and hungry. We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. We had no idea what to expect - we didn’t know about the Michelin rating and we hadn’t read any reviews. My husband was underdressed (T-shirt and shorts) but thankfully I was wearing a dress because the other diners were smartly attired. Despite my husband’s casual appearance, we were treated very warmly by the staff. We ordered off the regular menu. We shared the trout appetizer and we both ordered the lake perch. The server also brought us a 4-piece sampler as a pre-meal starter. The four “minis” were artfully presented and quite different in texture and taste. All dishes were delicious, but the portions were very small for two hungry people who were out walking all day. One thing important to note is that we were charged for the 4 mini starters even though we didn’t order them (sometimes chefs present you with a small welcome tasting and we wrongly assumed this was the case). Overall our experience was positive so we gave Materia four stars."

Materia,20,Trying too hard and failing,"We chose this restaurant on our honeymoon due to the high ratings and the Michelin star. I am a very adventurous eater, while my wife is not so much. But we chose the seven course tasting menu because you only live once! The first course was a few things, not sure what they were, with very little taste and everything was basically mushy. No texture variations. Several things were fishy.    Then more fishy stuff.  Then more fishy stuff.  Then, the worst bite of food I’ve ever tasted. It was plain pasta with a lot of fish sauce poured over it. That’s it. Spaghetti with raw fish sauce. The smell was toxic and the taste was awful. Now I’m a person that cooks with fish sauce and understands it’s uses. This was not it. They took pasta out of water and put fish sauce on it. We had to send it back.    The deconstructed pigeon was interesting and fun, but not particularly tasty.    Only go here if you are EXTREMELY adventurous and aren’t looking for anything that actually tastes good. If you want crazy tastes, go ahead and give it a try."

Materia,40,Innovative cooking in a contemporary setting!,"Nice contemporary ambiance! Service was very friendly and professional. We started off with 4 amuse-bouches which were very flavorful. The bread was awesome. For the primi course we both had the game meat ravioli which was very intensely flavored, outstanding! For the secondi course we also both had the pike fish which was very good but not exceptional. We should have listened to the server who was steeering us towards the pigeon but we really wanted to try the lake pike. We probably made a mistake. We did not have dessert although they brought us.a few complementary small bites that were quite tasty. Wine list was interesting but lacked some of the Italian wines/wineries I am most familiar with and I consider myself quite knowledgeable on Italian wines. Some was very helpful after I narrowed it down to a couple. Creative food coming from this kitchen for sure. Made for a nice evening!"

Materia,50,Excellent experience,A lovely journey through the taste and elegance. We picked 7 choices of the chef and enjoyed each bite of it.

Materia,50,innovative,"we enjoyed a relaxed evening in the private and intimate space of the restaurant. service is very welcoming and the menu was excellent. the kids loved their menu, too. highly recommended."

Materia,50,Creative and unique,"Up and coming michelin starred restaurant fulfilled its promise. Food was creative and unique an staff was patient, entertaining and kind."

Materia,50,Worth the visit !,"High quality food and wines. We took the 7 course menu with wine pairing. Every course had a personal note. The service has been very attentive and proactive.    Only side note, we mentioned in advance that it is going to be a birthday dinner. On this level we would have expected a little birthday surprise or else."

Materia,20,A bit of a disappointment :(,"We came to the restaurant with very high expectations because of what we read on trip advisor. I must begin by saying that the first picture showed on trip advisor it’s a place nowhere to be seen in the restaurant, so a bit misleading...    My husband and I love to go to Michelin restaurants and always try the tasting menu to be surprised! And we definitely were this time.    We knew (and were told by our nice waiters) that the menu was very experimental and that we would have unusual things to eat (which we were totally open to) but our main problem was the taste of some of the food... the flavor competition was too strong.    The pasta with the Indian spices, the red cabbage with vinegar and almond oil, particularly in these two cases, we found the food taste to strong to eat...    Finally the squab I think is way too graphic in the presentation with the leg and the feet showing...    Anyway, the service was great, the wine pairing as well... but the food not so much."

Materia,50,Great Amazing Restaurant!!,"Great Amazing Restaurant!!    The food is amazing!! We went (several times!) to try different menus. The service is great, polite, friendly and makes you feel welcome. The place looks decent but not really special, enough to make it a nice place.    Would definitly come here again! They’re amazing!"

Materia,50,Amazing unique food,"We have eaten in a lot of very good restaurants, but this was an amazing unique experience!! We took the 6 course experimental menu. All dishes were incredibly good. With great wine as well. Super friendly and passionate staff."

Materia,50,lovely surprise,"First time at Materia. Incredible food, setting and service. Something very contemporary close to Lugano"

Materia,20,Disappointing... not for us,"We were very disappointed in our dinner at Materia. We ordered the Classico tasting menu and we didn’t enjoy anything we received.  The only upside (and the reason for 2 stars, not 0) was the staff was friendly and attentive. Ultimately, I wish we hadn’t eaten here."

Materia,50,Michelin Star,"We couldn't get in on the Saturday night but managed the Friday night. An unimposing entrance belies the amazing dining experience. Service was 1st class, unobtusive, but efficient. Their explanations of menu options and wines was most helpful. Small appertisers appeared throughout the night, all exquisitely presented and delicious.  Highlights were the pickled red cabbage, caviar, smoked marrow and bitter almonds, closely followed by the linguine. Bonissimo."

Materia,50,"Fantastic Meal, Best in Como for the Price","We had the classic menu with wine pairing for dinner, The price was very reasonable and the creativity for each course was outstanding. What made the pricing even more remarkable was an amuse bouche and petit fours (in addition to menu items) that more closely resembled food temples in Paris but at a ""menu"" price well under half that for a Michelin one star. Our impressions before the trip was that Como area would be overpriced and just basic Italian food, that may be true of Bellagio (which was a crowded mess) but not the rest of the area. Very highly recommend Materia if in the area, worth the trip."

Materia,50,Amazing,"We visited this lovely place for lunch back in March and were really impressed. We went for the 11 course chef's experience which turned out to be the best choice we could have made. Each course was really innovative and special. The staff was friendly and very welcoming. It is true that the ambiente and interior design is rather minimalistic, but since we go to restaurants for the food in the first place this was not an issue at all for us. I guess a 2nd michelin star could be come hard to get because of the location, but the food would absolutely deserve it. Overall we can only recommend this gem of a restaurant.    Since we were there by car we were not able to drink alcohol, so the total bill was about 250 euro for 2 persons, which was an absolute bargain for the food that was presented."

Materia,10,They cancelled our reservation,"One night we walked in, tables were free, one our before close. They didn't have room, which can happen. No biggie. But it was when he asked the chef if they had room when the chef looked us up and down and refused us. Weird...    We called and made reservations on the next day. Our reservation would be for 9pm. Couple of hours later the restaurant called and cancelled our reservation. Reason was because the waiter hadn't seen the updated chart whatever whatever. They were not trying to make the situation better.. It was just a ""yeah sucks for you"" type of approach. Pretty snobby.."

Materia,50,Amazing food and great service,This restaurant was recommended after another restaurant we planned to go to was closed for an event.  We arrived around 2pm and there was no issue for having a late lunch.  The waitress was lovely and very welcoming. Was willing to make something thst was not on the menu as my partner did not eat what was on the menu. The food was amazing with great flavours and interesting combinations but not too out there. Good portion sizes.  We were there until almost 4pm and were not told to leave :-)  Was a great experience and would definitely go back if we're in the area again.

Materia,30,Its a matter of taste,"Personally, We do not like too much experimentation with our food or our food prepared in a lab but tjis is often what you get at Michelin restaurants. It’s very rare that you find a gem that offers innovative food snd a great overall experience. This place was not it! Additionally, in a land of Italy which thrives on design, has anybody heard of ‘ interior design ‘? Six dinners so far all in top rated TripAdvisor restaurants and not an ounce of design! No, my dear Italian friends, its not just about food; it’s about the overall experience!!!"

Materia,50,Wow!,We selected the 11 course taster menu and it didn’t disappoint. The portions were of a sensible size and were so tasty. The staff took time to explain each dish and clearly enjoyed what they did. Italy is full of good restaurants but this beats them all.

Materia,50,Amazing!!!,We visited early June of 2018 and were so impressed. Wonderful food and excellent wine pairing! Service was great as well. Should have at least 2 Michelin stars.

Materia,50,Outstanding,"This fully deserves the michelin star. The food is brilliant and service is first rate. They were so good with our kids...like really great. What a top restaurant,,!"

Materia,40,"New tastes without excesses, but location could be better","New food and flavors combination, a dessert with bone marrow and Safran, but just about anything has a twist of uniqueness. The tomato appetizer in its apparent simplicity is fantastic. The service is good (place very small and lots of manpower) but a bit to enfatic in the plates presentation. The ambiance is simple, maybe to simple for the price you pay (over 70€ per person excluding wine if you take a 3 courses. Very good pre appetizer and excellent friandises. The wine list covers also a number of interesting wine producing nations."

Materia,50,Simply phenomenal,Well deserving of their Michelin Star. It won't be long before they get their second or third star. We had the 11-course tasting menu and each and every dish was both extremely inventive and wonderfully delicious. The wine pairing was flawless and amazing. The service was attentive and perfect. I wish we lived locally; we would eat here all the time.

Materia,50,Great food,Loved this place. Food was very inventive without being presumptuous. We enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. Portions were perfect. Also had a very helpful wine sommelier. Convenient location. Well deserving of a Michelin star.

Materia,50,Wonderfully inventive meal,"Had a wonderful dishes here. The dishes likely change all the time, so I won’t list them. Suffice to say that it was one of the most original dinners we’ve ever had. The chef uses very unusual ingredients and creative combinations, but it all works. The interior is simple and spare, which is good-it doesn’t distract from the beautiful presentation. If you’re looking for very different food, this is an excellent choice."

Materia,50,Wonderful & inventive with a touch of Asian fusion,"As the rule of thumb goes, if the restaurant has beautiful view or surroundings, the food will not match it. The unassuming restaurant has extraordinary food, and is a reason for getting a Michelin star this past winter of 2018-19.    We had the 6 course dinner, surprise at 70 Euros/person. Each dish was a surprise & excellent. No foreigners were here this evening, which is good news.    The duck is served 2 different ways. To try & describe the courses & tastes is too complicated, so you have to try it yourself.    The service was great & friendly. Well worth the trip. Try it out for yourselves.    Enjoy the experience 😁"

Materia,50,Not your typical Italian but well worth a visit,"As other have said, this is a fabulous eating experience in an unassuming locale.  It’s fine dining, inventive and provoking (you might not love everything but you will get the skill behind it)  We had the classic tasting menu which at €60 represents great value; definitely not every day dining but worth it for a special occasion"

Materia,50,Perfect!,"We just loved the warm welcoming of Davide & Ambra and the staff. The food was excellent, very special, an experience. Wines combined with the food fantastic. We come back for sure :-)"

Materia,40,"An experience, not for every day!","We both had various dishes, amongst other the pasta bottarga, the pigeon, the black desert and others....it was an intellectual and challenging lunch, with many new tastes and tactile experiences in our mouth.... highly recommended. I came out enligthened of what food can do to your pallet. Pricing was very fair!"

Materia,50,best meal in Lake Como,"In a region storied for its natural beauty and resplendent palazzos, how does a restaurant compete from an unassuming building on an unassuming street? By having an fantastic chef with his own greenhouse who gets it right on every single dish. We had the classic tasting with wine pairing and enjoyed every single flavor. My guess is that eventually Chef Caranchini and his talented crew will answer the siren call of a bigger dining room where it will be harder to be as consistently inventive and true to one’s passion, but for now catch them at their best."

Materia,50,Amazing,"Young restaurant and young staff, great project and food! I have been impressed by the quality of products, the taste and presentation of dishes and the passion the team put in the project. Great experience!"

Materia,50,Best food ever,"I highly recommend this restaurant! Excellent food, great service, young staff and super wine list. Not to miss!"

Materia,50,"Unique experience, very cozy place and amazing food","We tried the “ sperimentazione a mano libera menu”! Amazing experience, we loved the food! We were super satisfied with portions and the quality! The staff was friendly and the environment very cozy. It feels like at home! I recommend it for the value of money!"

Materia,50,Great tasting menu and wonderful service,"Been there as a Christmas gift for our husbands (from my friend & me)  We choose the surprise menu.  All the dishes were very good and presented magnificently.  They were very attentive to our requests, allergies and likings.  Top dish were the risotto with Sansho pepper and the baked Kale . The dessert too innovative (for our liking, we d’rather have something more traditional)  The service is really dynamic and attentive.  The prices , in my opinion are fair for what you get.  Only thing I would improve is decoration. As is too much austere. Some candles or flowers will help relax the feeling.  But will come back for sure, to have a normal lunch or dinner (not menu next time)  The menu is great to try most of their creations.... all very particular and creative."

Materia,50,Try the Materia experience!,"Really excellent restaurant in Cernobbio, we have been here quite a few times and wanted to try the New Year’s Eve menu, we were not disappointed!! Food is not only delicious, cooked perfectly, well balanced and well presented, every dish is an unexpected surprise, combining ingredients that you would never expect. Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, I would highly recommend this restaurant and would also highly recommend one of the complete tasting menus if you don’t want to have just a simple dinner but a really nice and different experience!"

Materia,50,Lovely christmas lunch,"Amazing food, relaxing atmosphere and very good service. We are above average interested in food and we were actually surprised, not about the food itself but the casual atmosphere. We loved luncheon here, and will definitely be back! Thank you Materia."

Addison Restaurant,50,dessert,"zWell, everything was wonderful about the service and tasty and super creamy sweets, nothing like the others, it's all worth it"

Addison Restaurant,40,wow,The food was delicious and creative. The ambiance is relaxing. The staff was friendly. Ian was amazing.

Addison Restaurant,40,Birthday dinner,My wonderful wife booked this very e pensive restaurant months in advance. The service was over the top. They treat you like a conquering king. Food was very unique. Great experience.

Addison Restaurant,10,Ignorant on any level!,"Several attempts over a few months to get a reservation there remain unsuccessful. Voice mail messages remain unanswered, waiting lists never are recognized or at least you are told that nothing has changed and there won't be availability for the evening. With this attitude, no...More"

Addison Restaurant,20,All hype lacking substance.,All hype lacking substance. This is not a Michelin star Restaurant even thought it tries to be.. Jeune Et Jole Carlsbad is a million times better!

Addison Restaurant,50,Perfection....,"I have been to three Michelin Star restaurants In France that don’t compare to this food and service. The wine list is extraordinary, the food is phenomenal and the service was perfection. Amazing."

Addison Restaurant,50,An Experience,An experience your palate and senses will delight in. If you have the stamina the ten course tasting menu with wine pairing it is quite the hedonists delight. Starting right with the amuse bouche and ending with the gift of chocolates when you leave.

Addison Restaurant,40,Fantastic food and service.,"All of the dining options at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar are top notch. They are also priced to match, but worth it in general."

Addison Restaurant,40,Superb Dining!,"We went here for a date night. We drove a coupe hours for something new, and this place was a good pick. I cant wait to make another drive up again."

Addison Restaurant,50,Don’t miss,"This was an amazing dinner with a crazy price tag but worth every bite! 5 star Michelin , only one in San Diego!! Every course was truly an experience . It was a special occasion and there is nothing we would change! Service was stellar! James paired our wine perfectly!"

Addison Restaurant,50,Choreographed excellence!,"My wife and I are very fortunate to have dined in many of the world’s great houses of gastronomy. Last evening we placed Addison into our top 10. Addison is not for everyone; it’s a high ticket , 3 hour visit to your sight and senses. IF you are a serious foodie you will truly enjoy this glimpse of serious food and service excellence.  First impressions are of a beautiful restaurant and salon, graced with high ceilings and plenty of marble. A grand fireplace dominates the dining room.  We chose the 5 course dinner; not due to price, but the fact as we have gotten older, we just can’t eat that much. If I were 20 years younger, I would have definitely let the chef do his thing.  Our meal experience started with glasses of Krug Champagne. Our first course was a Cucumber Granite with Yogurt and Yuzu essence. Next came the “Petite Saveurs”, consisting of an Oscetra Caviar and Egg Mousseline Tart, a cheese filled Gougere and Smoked Wild King Salmon mousse in pastry “cigarette” with Salmon Caviar garni.  Our next course was Alaskan King Crab and Peeky Toe Crab with Coconut, Thai Basil and Passion Fruit.  A course of whimsy was a play on “ Chips and Dip”; again excellent.  A course of Wild Sea Bream with Tapenade, Artichokes and Bottarga was delicious.  Sweetbreads with Black Truffles, Iberico Ham and Smoked Potato Purée was finished with freshly grated Parmesan. It was our favorite of the evening.  A loaf of freshly baked Parkerhouse Rolls was served with three different and delicious butters including a dill herb butter, Honey butter and Butter sprinkled with Fluer de Sel.  Barbecued Duck Breast was the next course. It was garnished with a marinated Cherry, Duck Liver mousse, pickled Mustard and Duck Jus with Red Cabbage. Outstanding!.  A Riesling Sorbet with Melon Pearls and 24 Karat Gold Leaf was served to cleanse the palate .  Dessert was a Chocolate creation with Cassis, Cocoa and Salted Caramel.  Our mignardise consisted of Chocolate Ganache Tart, Frangipan Petit Four and Fruit Gel. We did enjoy a half bottle of Kosta Browne 2014 Pinot Noir, along with Coffee and Tea.  There was a choice of Grade 5 Wagyu, along with a Cheese course, which we did not partake of  Finally, our service team presented us with a beautiful box of Chocolates, along with a printed copy of the evening’s menu. Our car was waiting for us after this presentation.  The beautiful choreography of service, along with the chef’s bold cuisine statement, makes this an event to remember.  We highly recommend Addison and look forward to a return visit."

Addison Restaurant,50,"Best, Most Extravagant Restaurant in San Diego","There are many outstanding, ritzy restaurants in the San Diego area. This one is the best, most extravagant dining experience in the county. It is fairly out of the way, but it is well worth it. The staff has been well trained and it is fun, just to watch them cater to other tables. It's like a choreographed dance. The cocktails are amazing and their wine list is extensive. The food is outstanding. They only have two things on the menu (not quite). They either offer a 5-course meal or a 10-course meal. Everyone at the table has to order the same number of courses. Even though the portions are small, they fill you up. I can eat a lot, but I was completely satisfied after my 5-courses (overall, they give you more than 5, do desserts count? We had at least 3, plus a couple of pallet cleansers). We kept thinking that the next course was going to be the last, but they kept coming. It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. Their menu changes with what's available during a particular season, but only with the highest ingredients. During our dining experience (I won't go into the multiple pallet cleansers or multiple desserts), we were served caviar tarts alongside puff pastries with bacon liquid inside accompanied with salmon wrapped in a crispy shell. Next was a lobster and crab in a vanilla broth, accompanied with a crab and shrimp cracker. Next was a sea bream that was perfectly cooked. It had a slight heat, which was a pleasant surprise. After that, was a rich sweetbread with potatoes and shaved black truffle. It went really well with my earthy red wine. It was followed by a grilled duck that was over a flame. You could really taste the smokiness. It stood alone, but it also came with 6 items to accompany it (pate, soaked cherry, mustard, grilled onion, a reduction and a berry paste). I'm not a dessert person, but the desserts that followed were amazing. I won't get too into them, but there were pickled pears, dessert wine sorbet, a chocolate dish that incorporated 6 different types of chocolate, coconut macaroon, sugared jelly, chocolate tart. They also have a supplemental cheese cart, but I was too full to indulge myself. A true 5 star event."

Per Se,30,Poor management,"I had a 5 o’clock table for four at the lounge. This is the second time this manager short abrupt Spanish person spoke to me, inappropriately abruptly and arrogantly, and I’ll tell you who it was it. It was not Stephen I don’t know the managers name, but this is the second time this gentleman is giving me a hard time, and I’ve been to a restaurant on many occasions, and he was well aware of that."

Per Se,20,"Amazingly average, echos what the NY Times Critique.","I paid over $2,000 for the “upgraded menu”. Yes you heard right, over $2k for my wife and I. I heard Per Se received a negative review, and Chef Keller took it seriously and personally coached all the staff. Yet my experience echos the recent criticism.    First, most courses are so salty, I'm surprised Per Se is not hosting its own oceanic ecosystem. It's like the chef accidentally sneezed while seasoning and mistook the salt for confetti.    Secondly, the flavor is average - I was eating and waiting for the “wow” moment that never came. I went to many Michelin starred restaurants. I vividly remember the amazing teas at Oriole, the Arctic Char and the Netflix show worthy dessert presentation from Alinea, and the astonishing Uni Egg with Caviar at Providence. Yet, it’s only been three months since I dined at Per Se and don’t recall any dishes, especially for a $2000 meal.    Third, the service isn’t Michelin star worthy. It's like the staff attended a seminar on 'How to Be Inoffensively Blah.' There was no smile from anyone, even as I smiled at them and tried to be as polite as I could. Maybe this is just a New Yorker thing, or maybe they don’t think I belong there by the way I dress. Either way, I think Warren Buffet would not have a good time there (because he certainly doesn’t drive a fancy car or wear Gucci).    Hey Michelin Guide, do us all a favor and please, please, please reevaluate the Stars this restaurant deserves."

Per Se,50,Astonishingly good,"The entire experience was absolutely divine. As someone that dines by themselves fairly often, and has had a handful of unpleasant dinners as a result, this was the exact opposite.    Everyone at the restaurant made me feel extremely welcome, because they know that someone dining alone really does appreciate food. And, in return, their attention to detail (both in terms of hospitality and the food itself) was appreciated.    Even the extra little dishes they provided that were not on the menu were exceptionally good. And the chocolates, despite being so simple, were the best chocolates I've ever had - they were almost worth the expense of the dinner by themselves!    The price means it's obviously not an everyday occasion, but I will definitely be going back when I get the chance."

Per Se,50,Wonderful,"We loved Per Se. We had the tasting menu and wanted the paired wines but knew we wouldn't be able to drink them all. The sommelier was nice enough to provide us a reduced set of wines for the price of just one normal pairing and we loved what we were served.    The food was a wonderland of tastes, beautifully prepared, creative but not weird, and absolutely delicious. If cost is an issue, that probably puts too much pressure on the meal and then people are super-critical. But we just loved it.    The staff were fun as well, with lots of personality. We really enjoyed them.    We also loved that the seating is such that no one has to look at a wall. Many an expensive dinner has been ruined elsewhere by looking at walls.    Next time we're in NYC we will do it again."

Per Se,30,Disappointing!!,"This restaurant is great for tourists. This restaurant is NOT good for someone who understands good food. I've eaten at 11 Madison, Piaza Duomo, BlueHill at Stone Barn, and Alinea. Per Se doesn't even come close !!!    SERVICE:  The servers are friendly but not trained well enough to serve in a fine establishment.  Even the plates didn't match for the same dish served to all the guests - did they not have enough marching plates?  Server's communication was not clear    FOOD:  No plate cleaners were offered between meals.  The fried dishes were very oily.  Nothing really memorable or very creative was served.    Overall- extremely disappointing- what a pitty.    Michelin - stop the madness!"

Per Se,10,Tragedy of American high-end restaurant gourmet food,"Had a birthday party there recently. The hors d’oeuvres were ok as far as hors d’oeuvres went, I would rate them to be average, or 3/5. They included Wagyu beef, etc., good materials but below average cooking method.    But the main dishes were absolutely horrible, not palatable at all. Here is a summary of the problems were:  1. All the main dishes, including Salmen, chicken & lam were cold. Those were all sous vide cooked many hours prior to serving. The staff did not even bother to heat them up. I was expecting some sauté dishes with Maillard reaction, but no, all served were cold and unpalatable dishes.    2. All food is absolutely bland. Except for some salt, there was no seasoning, spice, or aroma of any kind. The food simply gagged me.    3. I do not know the price our party host paid, but from reviews of similar prefix menu there, I know it would be in excess of $1,000 per person.    The wines served on the other hand were excellent, the best i had in a long while."

Per Se,50,Good,"Per Se is, without question, an incomparable culinary experience that lacks an equal. As you enter the sleek and classic dining room overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park, you feel like you're simultaneously transported to the classic supper clubs of the 40's, without losing the substance, complexity, and modernity of today's greatest bakers and chefs."

Per Se,40,Fine dining experience,"I booked Per Se, and then my flight and hotel. It was a fine dining experience. For a Michelin 3-Star restaurant, the food was very good but not exceptional. The only dish that impressed me the most was the green circle Amish chicken – very original, creative, and flavorful. The variety of desserts was unexpected – they were wonderful! In addition to the 9-course meal of $390 pp, they offered other dishes ranging from $40 to $130. The staff was attentive and friendly. We were lucky Chef Thomas Keller was on site. He came out to greet the guests, and we took a picture with him."

Per Se,50,Absolutely the best meal we've had all year! (Even for Celiac disease folks),"What can I say? Celiac heaven! The staff were so understanding for our 2 with Celiac (and very sensitive to contamination). We had the 9 course tasting menu and the 2 with Celiac had a slightly modified menu. We all LOVED it and no contamination! A beautiful night of absolutely delicious GF food. Absolutely worth the money!  Hint: If time allows, you can ask for a tour of the kitchen....a treat to see!"

Per Se,40,"Still worth the visit, in my opinion!","Per Se is an iconic New York restaurant by The French Laundry’s chef, Thomas Keller. It doesn’t disappoint: the appetizers, cheeses and desserts from the tasting menu are some of the best food we’ve ever had in New York. I’d highlight the impeccable oysters with caviar, the tomato and heart of palm salad, the cheese pastry with truffles, the chocolate chai pudding, and the cappuccino ice cream. The view from the tables is gorgeous. Service is also top notch and delightfully friendly (feels like you’re not on Manhattan - chuckles).    We just weren’t as impressed with the meat dishes - the crab pierogi was good, but not mouth-dropping; the chicken was the best of the three, but still not awe inspiring; and the lamb prime rib tasted blander and less tender than we hoped.    I’m giving 4/5 stars only because, when you pay this high a price for a meal, my expectations are that every step of it will be moving and memorable. This was the case with a good part of the menu, but far from all of it."

Per Se,30,Beauty & The Beast,"Without doubt, the best meal I have ever had (& I’ve been lucky to dine in some of the best restaurants in the world).    Brilliant ingredients, perfectly cooked, impeccably served by a wonderful front of house team.    It’s expensive but more than worth it if you can afford it.    But…as I was basking in the afterglow of the finest culinary experience I’ve ever had, I was brought back to earth with a bump when I turned my attention to the check.    So confused have I become by New York’s baffling array of new tipping protocols I called Per Se prior to attending to ensure I had correctly understood their concept of “Service included”. “Service is included” I was assured.    Yet, at the end of the meal - CLUNK!! There it was in black and white on the credit card slip, “Service included” it yelped, but then added a snarling, stage-whispered, “Optional Gratuity” prompt. It was all wrapped up in a leather wallet and handed to me by the delightful waitress who had charmed us throughout the meal.    What the heck is one supposed to do? I wasn’t alone in my dismay, the gentleman on the table beside us asked the waitress “what’s with this extra gratuity thing? I thought it was service included?”.    “We’re paid an hourly rate…” she started…but the deafening clunky clattering of an embarrassed, confused and bemused customer drowned out whatever she said next.    “It’s my new favourite restaurant” he said, “but…this is all a bit weird”.    I felt similarly. A place like this doesn’t need to humiliate its customers in this way.    Yes, most of their clientele will either be filthy rich enough to throw down a few hundred extra dollars without batting an eyelid or not give a fig about leaving nothing.    This gauche, grubby hand-held-out, last ditch effort to extract who knows how many hundreds of dollars more - should surely be below an establishment of this class. Yet it stoops that low, turning the cheapest of tricks.    The only people bothered by this revolting practise are those who can just about afford this brief foray into the world of luxury dining. They will either be shamefully bullied into leaving an extra one or two hundred dollars they can ill afford, or left feeling somewhat shabby and embarrassed by their decision not to.    I was aiming to make another visit next month when I’m back in New York, pushing the boat out again, but it’s clear that this restaurant would rather gorge itself on clientele with deeper pockets than mine.    It’s not gauche per se, yet it’s certainly on the cusp of being so when it comes to an unnecessarily (un)happy ending.    In spite of the fabulous food, I left with a bad taste in my mouth."

Per Se,50,"Fantastic dinner, perhaps my new favorite in NYC","Our dinner last Wed night at 3* Per Se was phenomenal. I’d always avoided dining here due to the ridiculous jacket requirement (that’s now only recommended) and after a good but otherwise unremarkable dinner at French Laundry many years ago.    To say this was a vast improvement is an understatement. Per Se hit it out of the park for me. Everything was stellar. The food was sublime. I even loved the signature oyster and pearls — even as I’m not fond of oysters. The foie gras add on was delish. The black truffle add on for the risotto must have been the most generous truffle servings I’ve ever seen anywhere; they returned for a second helping of truffles without being asked and dropped enough each time to make me literally salivate. Every course was incredible, and all of the wine pairings were inspired and outstanding.    Service was polished and formal — but definitely relaxed once I got them going. We joked around with the team and had a good time of it. That’s a big plus for me to avoid the stodgy atmosphere that too often can accompany more stars.    I’d return in a heartbeat."

Per Se,30,Most of the food was tasty,"though, a dish or two were too sweet. But, I have to say this, be prepared to be hungry when you get home. Their 'duck breast' entree on the menu was literally the width of a strip of bacon... I could have eaten it in one bite. Luckily, it was on a vendor's bill."

Per Se,50,Fantastic …,"Although I would still prefer the less New York style and vibe of the French Laundry in Napa, this place again creates an outstanding food experience very few in this world can create. Every dish of the pre-set menu is unique and another fantastic experience. A beautiful evening … supported by excellent staff … and of course great wines. Just SUPER."

Per Se,50,One of the best experiences,"Had a wonderful evening here with friends. It was simply amazing! The food, the atmosphere and the service were outstanding."

Per Se,50,Perfect,"Service and food were as great as we have ever experienced. So elegant. Staff did a fantastic job. We were given the couch in the lounge, which we thought was the best table in the house. Saw day turn into NYC evening. Will never forget it. My wife looked so beautiful."

Per Se,50,Top restaurant worldwide,"Per Se is my favourite restaurant in the world ex aequo with Carlo Cracco restaurant in Milan. Location is wonderful. Service excellent. Menu outstanding. Someone can think prices are too high for a dinner. This is a mistake. Prices are fair for such a menu of masterworks. At least once in the entire life, everyone should go for dinner at Per Se."

Per Se,20,"Great view, food not so great",Nothing was delicious. Nothing was bad. The taste of the food is not up to the standards of a gourmet restaurant. The wine paring serves predominantly well chosen sub $100 wines (some $30 bottles are served) with the exception of the champagne

Per Se,40,A Little Disappointed….,"Being a foodie, I have wanted to try Per Se for a long time. Had dinner there tonight and have to say I was a bit disappointed. The food was very good, but the service left a bit to be desired. For the number of staff running around, you should not have to ask for refills on water or for another cocktail. It happened more than once throughout the evening.    For being rated a Michelin 3, the expectation is high and Per Se missed the mark. It also felt a bit rushed. I’m glad I marked it off the list, but not sure I would go again."

Per Se,50,An evening never to forget,"Per Se has been on our bucket list for many years now.  Now was the time to try their Evolution Menu at 850 USD.  For that price it better be good.  Good was not the word ... fantastic is a better word.  Everything was just perfect.  Food, wine and service could not have been any better.  Looking forward to come back another time :-)"

Per Se,10,"Very disappointing experience, very average cuisine for a ridiculous price.","The food was fine but extremely overpriced, with zero special details, surprises or extra effort which is a must for a 3 michelin star restaurant. Very mediocre cuisine for 3000 usd for a table of 4persons. Extremely disappointing."

Per Se,50,Outstanding experience,"Food wise, Being Peruvian is hard to please and very hard ti impress.  We have been to French Laundry several times but I have to day that Mr Keller does a fantastic job here too. The restaurant us cozy and elegant with a beautifull view if Columbus circle. If you really want to treat yourself and enjoy do the dining room and not the salon (which feels more like a bar set up and not a real restaurant).  Everybody is very corteous and unlike past experiences at the French Laundry, very flexible with food. They make you feel really pampered. The food is really a culinary experience and even ingredients that are not your favorites turn up so pleasant and interesting.  All dishes were great but i will have to say that the bread (although fantastic) bus off being served in the middle if the meal. Also the pasing is a ""little slow"".  We were attended by the Maitre D"

Per Se,50,A dream culinary NYC experience,"A US/NYC culinary Michelin star establishment. Per Se is a superb 3 Michelin star restaurant. Jaw dropping views, brilliant thoughtful service, delicious food and first rate and surprisingly value for money wine list. Worth the splurge."

Per Se,50,Complete perfection,"My husband and I were celebrating his promotion and this was the perfect evening. The food was divine and service impeccable. We cannot fault it, from the moment we entered the restaurant to the moment we left. It is very clear why this place is rated so highly. If you ever get the chance to visit please take it."

Per Se,50,Great Food and Views,"There are few tables next to window, those are definitely the best tables with views of midtown. This is a fancy place so I would wear a jacket unless you want to stand out in a bad way. The service is quite formal and professional. The food is what you would expect in a 3-Michelin star tasting menu. It didn't really knock my socks off but I'm thinking because ingredients are harder to get after a pandemic. Supply chain issues, but that's my theory since most restaurants I used to like are just not as good now. The guy in charge is very down to earth which is a change of pace from the other formal servers. I'm not sure if I come back because it's too formal here and I like to dress down with hoody, cap, and Jordans."

Per Se,30,Not a 3-star experience,"Having done some 3* Michelin restaurants, this was the poorest experience: 30min before we got a drink, cold atmosphere no music, no amuses-bouche, no bread nor other.  8 courses, too small portions without taking any taste/flavor risk. The 3 first courses were very buttery/greasy. Could produce this at home. No explanation about wines nor food. Service was average but very far from a 3-star experience.  Not worth 1000$ for 2!"

Per Se,50,A delightfully orchestrated experience,"I could not wish for a better celebration of my birthday. The experience fully lived up to the expectation in smallest detail. From the food which was a divinely crafted composition, through wine pairing, that elevated the experience even further, to the service that was just perfect. I felt grateful to be alive and able to enjoy the moment I will truly never forget. Thank you"

Per Se,50,Superb experience,"What a setting to enjoy post-Covid lockdown! Classy decor, very professional and at the same time friendly service (funny sommelier!), unforgettable food services with researched ingredients, selection of wines to die for. Thanks to all the team for such wonderful evening!"

Per Se,50,Excellent Meal,"We dined here just before Thanksgiving 2021, and the meal was outstanding. We didn't mind the upselling at the beginning, and the white truffle was well worth it anyway. The staff was very attentive, and the food was excellent. There was even a brief kitchen tour at the end where we saw Chef Keller on CCTV from the French Laundry. We will definitely return and are considering turning it into an annual holiday tradition."

Per Se,50,Absolutely Wonderful,"Just an incredible experience. Décor is simply gorgeous, service is just the best. And the food is to die for. Beautifully presented, and a wonderful range of tastes. Great views of Central Park, and definitely worth the splurge."

Per Se,10,“Are we at Applebee’s or are we at Per Se?” Buyer Beware,"""Are we at Per Se or are we at Applebee's?"" This was the question on our minds as we ate dinner. Buyer beware - do not come to Per Se if you are expecting a refined and elegant dining experience. Per Se has no expected standards of attire and behavior being enforced confirmed by its own maitre d Alex Pimentel. This failure of the purported three Michelin star institution greatly reduced the quality and enjoyment of our experience and was far below what we have experienced in the past at Per Se or other three Michelin star restaurants.    One table in our direct view had two very old men with two teenaged-looking girls. One girl was wearing sweatpants, a crop top, and flip flops. The other girl was wearing a sweatshirt and sneakers. One of the old men had a little black puppy with him and Per Se allowed the puppy to run around the floor of the dining room throughout the dinner. Another table next to us was obnoxiously loud throughout the evening, taking over the space and taking away from everyone else's enjoyment.    It was clear from the circus around us that Per Se has no standards for guest attire or behavior and does not care about guest experience at all. When I wrote to the restaurant after our dinner to share our feedback, the maitre d Alex Pimentel asked me to call him to talk. After playing phone tag a couple times, we were finally able to connect. Alex began the phone conversation by flippantly stating ""I understand you had a problem with some guests who weren't dressed as nicely as you would have liked?"" Wow. This is the guy they put in charge of guest relations? What a great attitude for the job. Alex ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time by making up excuses for every single aspect of our underwhelming dining experience. According to Alex:    1) Per Se does not have a dress code for women, only for men. Women can apparently dine in a string bikini and flip flops. Alex says: ""Per Se gets people from all walks of life and unfortunately we really only enforce a dress code for men.""    2) Alex said the old men were hotel guests and that they were dining with their ""nieces or daughters."" I told him that we could not care less where the old men were lodging or the nature of their relationship with the teenaged girls, but that the young women should at the very least not be wearing sweatpants, crop tops, flip flops, sweatshirts, and sneakers. Alex once again reiterated that there is no dress code for women.    3) Alex could not come up with an excuse for the puppy running around.    4) Alex said that if we were disappointed at any point in the evening with our experience, the burden was on us to try to create the experience we want. Alex said we should have complained about the other guests (all seated within earshot) and we may have been reseated space permitting. So a three Michelin star restaurant is putting the onus on its guests to create a fine dining experience. Why would it be on guests to make sure Per Se enforces basic standards of attire and behavior of other guests? When Per Se allows a circus in its dining room, Per Se is not going after a three Michelin star experience. When the maitre d tells guests that it is actually their burden and responsibility to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience, there is something terribly wrong with the training and culture at Per Se.    5) Food: lobster was extremely chewy like bubblegum. The chicken was bland and a bit rubbery. Loved the crispy skin on the bass. Lamb was just lamb, but on the tougher side. The wagyu was unremarkable. Black truffle pasta was delicious with a generous shaving of truffles.    6) Service: star is for Maris who was fantastic and we appreciated her excellent service and professionalism. Maris seemed to be the only one we encountered at Per Se who was aware that the restaurant is supposed to provide a three Michelin star experience. The wine pairing was $350 and the sommelier was perfunctory and inattentive.    Alex concluded our phone conversation with an underwhelming, ""well in the future please reach out to me to coordinate your next visit to Per Se."" He didn't even offer a genuine apology without excuses or any gesture of good will from the restaurant.    Will we be coming back to Per Se after this experience and Alex's response to our feedback? As Randy Jackson once eloquently stated, ""Yeah that's gonna be a no from me, dawg."""

Le Bernardin,30,Don’t waste your money!,"Quite a bizarre experience at Le Bernadin and we were really looking forward to the evening.  I’ll start with the actual dining room. Underwhelming, large and the layout gives you the feeling that you’re in a dining hall rather than an intimate exclusive restaurant.  The food. We had the full tasting menu with wine pairing. The bread was awful. I always look forward to the bread because usually in good restaurants you get good bread. The so called baguettes could’ve been a frozen one from Lidl. In fact that would be insulting to Lidl. Extremely poor quality.  Most of the dishes excluding the mains of Fluke and Halibut were delicious pretty much a 10/10. The two main dishes however were a big fail. Seriously not good at all.  What was almost shocking about this restaurant was the service. Ok, it was like a well oiled machine. You didn’t want for anything and everyone went around their business perfectly in sync but with absolutely ZERO interaction with us. Rushed, clinical, robotic, cold and unsmiling. Totally bizarre. We had a 8-10 course dinner and we were in and out in less than two hours. We would NEVER come back here again. For 1200dollars there are a million and one other restaurants to go to for a quarter of the price and sensational service and food. Can’t believe you have 3 stars."

Le Bernardin,50,Worth the Trip.,"It had been twenty years since the last visit  Anticipation fueled my food lust and heightened  the trip to NYC leaving me eager to feel and taste.  It’s a pleasure and a satisfaction to be seated and  made ready to enjoy. The table top screams the  confidence of the house and the French cuisine does the  same. Whether it’s the stunning Caviar or perfect Fluke  the plate grabs the imagination. The table took the  menu which leaves freedom to converse and critique.  By the end of the eight plates almost every point of  light had been touched and savored. Impeccable.  There is a dryness though to service that slips into an  almost flat finale. It is hard to maintain. This however  is Le Bernardin so it’s expected. This is the restaurant  that the French hold dear and champion for all time.  My first such restaurant was La Table des Cordeliers  in Condom, Gers, France in 1976. Rarely do I get to be  reminded of that place and that time. I do by Le Bernardin."

Le Bernardin,40,Not three stars,"I was underwhelmed by the restaurant. Maybe it is the black bass I ordered, but it is just like any fish in any fine dining restaurant. I was expecting to be wowed in the three michelin star restaurant. My partner, she tasted sand in her scallop, which is unacceptable. I don't know, maybe my expectations are too high."

Le Bernardin,50,Fabulous!,"We had lunch and what a lunch! Tasting menu with wine pairings, everything flows and dances in your mouth.  From the halibut and the langoustine to the scallops and the Maine lobster, it is just divine!  Enough with the food, it is too good to describe, you need to experience it!  The service is spectacular. From the front door to the table, it is a sumptuous ballet of professional minds.  There is a reason Le Bernardin has 3 stars, it is perfect!"

Le Bernardin,50,Barbara turned a 3 star into a 4 star,We opted for Le Bernadin for my birthday. There is simply no place better with fish. Today was no exception. The food and service was outstanding.  I hesitated to write this since it seems only negative reviews are marked helpful. But I had to tell someone about our sommelier Barbara. Her contribution (and the wines) put the meal over the top. We had the 8 course tasting menu with wine. Barbara said we would each get the equivalent of a bottle of wine. She sensed this was more wine than we would want and said she could pare it back and still match it up. So we had our champagne followed by magical pairings and were still able to walk out. All 3 stars have great food. What sets them apart is the”of course you can” attitude as  exemplified by Barbara. She sensed what we wanted and made it happen.

Le Bernardin,40,A 'reluctant' Michelin 3* offering inconsistent dishes from spectecular to just so-so!,"Michelin 3 stars, New York Times 4 stars, La Liste joint #1 Restaurant in the World, San Pellegrino World’s Best 50 Restaurant List……….etc, etc.    Since its opening over 3 decades ago, continuous culinary accolades and awards had been pouring in for this New York gastronomic temple. As such, with such stellar credentials, to most of the gourmands in our party, a meal at this iconic institution has become the most anticipated foodie event of the year, if not in their young life?!    For lunch, two dining options were offered. First, a full blown USD300+, 8 course chef tasting menu that the whole table has to participate in. Alternatively, a protracted, reduced 3 course table d’hote made up the other option. Though it would be enticing to savor so many of Chef Ripert’s creations all at once, however, to Rosy, having an 8 course tasting menu so early in the day was too much of a daunting task. Consequently, the entire party settled for the reduced course alternative.    Our selected luncheon option followed a formidable and challenging format. For the first course, patrons were requested to pick a single dish from a list of nearly 20 imaginative, mouth watering and unique, ‘almost raw or barely touched‘, seafood creations. For the main course, 8 ‘lightly cooked’ seafood and fish masterpieces were offered. Man! So many selections to choose from!..talk about information overload and tough decisions making!..Maybe a nice task for ChatGPT?! Ha!    Our fun yet frustrating evaluation and selective process yielded the following first, main and dessert course options:    AMUSE BOUCHE:    Salmon Rillette; Sourdough Bread Crisp.  BREAD SERVICE:    4 Bread Samples ( Brioche, Baguette, Walnut & Raisins……plus  Normandy Butter )  FIRST COURSE:    Shellfish Medley  Uni, Razor Clams, Langoustine, Mirugai, Shrimp Custard, Smoked  Pork Dashi Broth.  Bacalao  Warm Bacalao Escabeche under a cloud of Saffron Brandade  MAIN COURSE    Dover Sole  Pan roasted Dover Sole, Green Olives, Toasted Almonds, Aged  Sherry Wine Emulsion.  Fluke  Pan seared Fluke, Twice Baked Mini Potatoes, Urchin-  Bouillabaisse Emulsion  Hiramasa  Grilled Hiramasa, Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, Bone Marrow -  Red Wine Bordelaise  DESSERT    Baba Au Whiskey - Purple Sweet Potato ‘Baba’, Caramelized  Pecan, Smoked Okinawa Sugar Ice Cream  Citrus ‘Madeleine’ - Vanilla Genoise Sponge, Lemon Mousseline,  Berry Medley  Peruvian Dark Chocolate - Warm Peruvian Chocolate Tart, Tahitian  Vanilla Ice Cream  Corn - Sweet Corn Mille-Feuille, Salted Caramel Sauce  Sorbet - Poire William  So! What is the overall verdict? Was the quality of the food superb and distinctive enough to exude the degree of greatness that commensurates with a Michelin 3* plus other preeminent ratings and accolades that were bestowed upon it?    For this, one has to evaluate and critique from the viewpoint of Chef Eric Ripert’s philosophy towards treating and preparing fish and seafood. In short, Chef Ripert loves to adopt a ‘simple’ approach to cooking fish, treating the natural ingredients with respect and letting the characteristic shine on its own. Based on this, ingredients used in each and every one of our dishes were prepared and executed flawlessly and with loving care by the talented kitchen. So, the answer is a resounding ‘Yes’!    Accompanying sauces or seasoning, where necessary, were well-balanced and care was taken not to overpower the main ingredients……. Though in some cases, may be a touch too conservative and overly cautious? These were reflected by the ‘too delicate‘ taste profile of the Seafood Medley and the underwhelming, ‘taste lacking’ Bordelaise sauce accompaniment for the Hiramasa dish. On the other hand, the Dover Sole and the Fluke were simply amazing, totally worthy as Michelin 3* offerings. I have lived and worked in Britain and France for over a decade and have had my fair share of well executed Dover Soles. However, this Le Bernardin’s rendition was heads and shoulders above the rest, both in taste, degree of doneness and texture……the best and tastiest ( western style preparation ) Dover Sole I have come across.  In this scenario, the pros canceled the cons resulting in a no-decision!    Dessert courses were one of the best and spectacular collections I have come across ( the other, Robuchon au Dome in Macau ).    Overall atmosphere in my opinion was a bit stuffy and pretentious. Front-of-house a touch dim and under-lite.    Service, though efficient, lacked smile and enthusiasm.    So, in conclusion, is Le Bernardin worthy of its Michelin 3* status? The answer is a reluctant Yes……more like 70% three stars and 30% two stars. As for the #1 rating on La Liste?! This I beg to differ, noting quite a few Michelin establishments I have frequented in Europe and the Orient ( especially Japan and Hong Kong ) offered better overall dining experiences."

Le Bernardin,50,Superb dining experience,"Yes, its elegant, yes its pricey and, yes, Le Bernadin lives up to its reputation. Excellent service and absolutely superb food. Presentation is perfection here, but quality is also key to seafood dishes that are deliciously delicate. There is a chef's tasting menu as well as an extensive a la carte--choose 4. A splendid experience."

Le Bernardin,50,Best Fine Dining Experience,"This is the only 3 star Michelin restaurant in NYC that caters to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.    Ambiance: I love the subtle decor of the restaurant. It is very elegant and refined and I love the different utensils and plate ware that the restaurant carries.    Food: My review of the food is based on the experience with the 8 course veggie tasting menu. All the dishes were delicious and unique. I don't think I've ever had vegetables cooked to such a perfect temperature and consistency. The food was plated beautifully as well. The desserts were so unique and each bite held a different taste and surprise. From the guests who joined me, they felt that all the non-vegetarian food was also delicious and exceeded expectations.    Service: The service is excellent and staff were very attentive. Everyone was very friendly from the individual who called us to offer us an earlier dinner time to the hostess and service staff.    Price: Considering the 3 star status, I would say the 8 course tasting menu was priced reasonably. I also love that they price the vegetarian tasting menu lower so that it feels fair. It's one of the few restaurants who actually does this.    Overall, one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had."

Le Bernardin,50,Sublime dining,"We had high expectations and all were met. The staff was extremely friendly and engaging throughout dinner. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings, but started with a Kir Royale and followed with caviar and chilled vodka before dinner service. We both enjoyed every dish and my husband usually dislikes fish; he raves this is the best seafood he’s ever had. I have to agree. The sauces were flawless and each fish course was perfectly prepared. We look forward to eating here again soon."

Le Bernardin,30,Worthy but not Overwhelming,"Dined with friends and family on September 18th. We had the 4-course experience. Started out with a Manhattan. It was quite disappointing as I do not believe that they keep the whisky in the freezer, thus, being able to create a perfect Manhattan made perfectly. A warm Manhattan is short of the mark. I came in with an open mind and great expectations as this is my first 3-star dining experience. The sauces that came with the fish servings were the highlight of each course. Serving size was adequate. The wines were descent but nothing special. I was hoping for the best fish meal I ever had but that did not happen. The best fish dining experiences I have ever had were in Howth Ireland (Crabby Joes) and Coeur d'Alene Idaho (Paddy's sports Bar). At least I can say I dined in a 3-Star Michelin Restuarant."

Masa,50,Exceellent food,"Simply awesome. The best 3 star Michelin restaurant we have had. And we eat a lot of Michelin. Only draeback, it's expensive. But believe me when I say the price justifoes the quality of food. But surpringly there wrere no dessert after the palatte cleanser?!"

Masa,50,An outstanding lunch in Midtown Manhattan,"The bar at Masa (""barmasa"") is a favorite for excellent Japanese meals with outstanding service at a reasonable price. If you start out with sake (you really should) the sommelier will guide you through the sake lists as though they are all bordeaux premier crus. Since I usually know what I want to eat (this was not my first -- or second--visit) I skipped the detailed menu descriptions, but I'm sure they would be helpful for a newbie like the single gentleman at the next table. The servers manage to treat you like an old friend who needs a few clues, and no matter what you order it will be delicious and elegantly served.as I expect in Tokyo, although rather rare in New York. Anyhow we had beautifully served tuna temaki followed by cold noodles and tempura shrimp, the traditional Japanese summer meal. My only ""criticism"" was the lack of light, readily solved with my iphone but I'm sure my server would have immediately produced a flashlight..."

Masa,50,The Best Sushi!,We had to think several times before making the reservations. The cost of dining in this restaurant is much more than other restaurants in the area. How is this place different? What sets this place apart from others? We could only satisfy our curiosity by taking the plunge. I am so glad we did! We were in awe and amazed by each dish. It's an elevated gustatory sushi experience. The sake served was also superb! I only have good things to say about this place. Definitely worth it! We will certainly return!

Masa,50,Long awaited,Truly a three star experience. Outstanding appetizers and impeccable sushi. Accompanied by an equally outstanding sake tasting. All dishes exceptional and with a service that was comparable. The ikebana piece behind the Hinoki counter was stunning. Some possible improvements: the china/earthenware was forgettable and biggest minus chef Masa stood in the middle behind the counter only talking to some “regular” customers and ignoring the other. At 3000 dollars for two one could at least expect an “hello” and maybe even a “thank you”.

Masa,40,High end sushi,High end authentic Japanese restaurant. It is a fixed price menu and it is not cheap probably one of the most expensive restaurants in New York. But the quality is high. Some of the best sushis that you may find in New York. Some of the dishes however were not to my like. It could be a personal taste. Decor and ambience is authentic and pleasant. Service was excellent. They have no photographic policy which I find to be unrealistic and meaningless.

Masa,10,Over rated to say the least,"Ridiculous, bad service, fast food type of sushi… I don’t know how Michelin gives the stars!!?? Portions and plate setting were amateur"

Masa,50,The best sushi of my life.,"We had an absolutely perfect experience. After being shown to our table and ordering cocktails, the host came to tell us that two seats at the Chef's counter had opened and we would be served by Chef Masa himself. I couldn't believe it!    Every. Single. Bite. Is. Heaven.    I cannot say enough good things about it. The quality of the fish is unlike anything I've ever had. It is a ton of food, so come very hungry. You won't want to leave a single piece of rice on your plate. It is that good.    The staff are incredible and anticipate your needs. I don't know how they are doing this but they are there the second you need anything.    Yes, it's expensive. It is worth it. I would do it all over again. If you are ever considering treating yourself to the best sushi of your life then you must go here. And if you are lucky enough to be seated before Chef Masa, get ready for an incredible experience."

Masa,50,"Best Sushi Place in NYC, perhaps the country","3 Michelin stars is spot on. Sushi is extremely diverse and fresh. For Sushi lovers who are foodies, you must go here and give it a try. If you do not like Sushi, this is not the place for you. Every piece was freshly made and brought to your plate with a special sauce or topping. Follow the chef's recommendations.    The decorations and ambiance were spectacular. I could hear the water and lovely background music. Lighting was just perfect.    The service was over-the-top. We had the chef's tasting menu with wine accompaniment. Every course meant that plates, utensils were changed. Table cleaned off. I do recommend the chef's table where you can watch everything they do. Go to restroom? They will be there to push your seat in. Run out of water? No way, ever. There is always someone behind you watching in case you need something.    Some of the sushi was seared. Still raw, but using a sword-like long knife into the hot coals and then searing your sushi. Each course and wine was explained including where sourced. For the wine tasting, we were given options of all wine, all sake, or a mix. I do not like sake, but my wife mentioned that it was because I had never had good sake before. She was right. We both chose the mixed.    We were offered a Kobe A5 add-on which we split. I do not like raw or rare beef. But this was great (completely raw like the sushi).    There were a couple of cooked dishes, but those were mostly the appetizers. My favorite dish was the shiitake mushrooms seared over those coals and then topped with truffle oil. Oh my! Speaking of favorites, make note of yours because they will offer you one extra of your favorites at the end. The mushroom was my favorite.    Cell phone usage is not allowed. Nice to be free of them and everyone around us too. And no pictures. At the end of dinner, we were allowed to take pictures.    There is no one specifically to call out. This is because when everyone is exceptional, you cannot pick one.    I must say, this was one of the most expensive two-person dinners I have ever had. The 16-course Joel Robuchon with premium-wine accompaniment was the only other one in this area. Specifically 1k+ per person."

Masa,50,Incredible!,This place is amazing The place is nice and comfortable The service is excellent The food is unbelievable This was incredible from beginning to end

Masa,10,AWFULL and great,the food was soggy and had been stale i had to wait 2 hours for a meal to come and all i wanted was to have food the good thing that is amazing is the drinks they are great

Masa,50,Best food ever,"The best food ever! Top service! I ve been to all the top restaurants in nyc, thought per se was my fav but masa topped it, you won’t believe how good it is, worth every penny spent."

Masa,20,Walk on By: Mediocre Nigiri At Best,"We went to Masa Bar (because Masa is an outrageous $500 Omakase compared to Morimoto's Philly's Omakase of just over a $100 and spectacular) and ate 6 pieces of nigiri (2 of us): it was dry and mediocre. The nigiri in Cleveland (eg, Table 45) is far superior. The 6 pieces of nigiri and one glass of rose wine (shared) with tip cost almost $90! Outrageous price for sorry food."

Masa,50,"Yes, it’s worth it.","Ok. I know the price seems ludicrous. I know it’s kinda nuts to spend so much money on one meal. But imho some meals are worth it. And Masa was definitely worth it. Masa also has very large portions, which ended up being a heavy meal. Too heavy for me anyway. The quality of the meal was out of this world. Tasty, unique, novel, daring, interesting, modern and downright delicious. I still think about a couple of the courses now months later. Memorable is an understatement. Yes, it’s all worth it in my opinion. My husband thinks so too. He took me out for my birthday dinner and all I can say is Wow and Thank You, My Love!"

Kashiwaya,50,Worth the detour! A lovely lunch in Osaka,We had a wonderful lunch at Kashiwaya. The service was exceptional from the moment we walked through the door. We were led to a private room where we were served dish after dish of beautiful and delicious plates in perfect tune with the terroir of the Osaka region.    The menu follows traditional Kaiseki format and our servers kindly explained the significance of the different components in each dish as it relates to the current season. We made our reservation on the MyConcierge website (my first time doing this) and everything went very smoothly. We have eaten at several 3 star Kaiseki restaurants and this ranks highly among them. Definitely worth the detour!!!

Kashiwaya,50,Fabulous,"I have developed the theory that very good restaurants are frequently divisive. There will be many diners that love a good restaurant and leave glowing reviews. Others will simply not like the concept and, having potentially paid a very great deal of money for an experience that did not hit the spot, will leave poor reviews. Looking at a couple of recent reviews for Kashiwaya, it seems that this is the case here.    For my part, this is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten in. As my son said, it would almost be worth the journey from London to Osaka simply to visit this restaurant. It is expensive but, equally, you get what you pay for.    As far as I could see, the restaurant comprises a collection of private dining rooms and we were shown to a delightful space upstairs. Decoration is traditional Japanese with cloth covered walls and a tatami mat floor. The table was close to the floor but was placed over a pit (for want of a better expression ) into which your legs went, so that you could sit very comfortably on the floor.    The service is superb with an amazing sense of ceremony. Each time we were visited, typically by two or three of the staff, the door was slid open and they bowed outside before making their way to the table to serve us. Two of the staff members spoke a fair to good level of English and were perfectly well able to explain the various different courses and sake.    The food is exceptional and fully deserving of three Michelin stars. Inevitably I enjoyed some course more than others but all were good. I especially like the 'moon' theme than ran through the dinner and inspired many of the courses."

Kashiwaya,30,1 star at most,"I went to this restaurant after another 3 stars restaurant Hajime, which I was very happy with. So I expected some surprising tastes and textures but it was a disappointment. The food didn't worth a detour nor flying to dine here. The food tasted just like it looked. I mean raw fish tastes like raw fish but I expected them to do something with the ingredients and turned out to be something unexpected in terms of flavors and textures. They tried to serve the best seasonal ingredients using Japanese cooking. No offense but you can imagine authentic Japanese cooking, which tend not to add much flavor to ingredients resulting in very mild flavor food, which I could have it elsewhere in Kyoto. I expected more than this from 3 stars Michelin and I know what kind restaurants to look for now. I love to be excited and surprised.    So if you want an above average authentic Japanese restaurant, this restaurant maybe for you but if you are looking for something surprising, it's not for you. The decorations were like small old Japanese room and 2 small tables, which could only fit 2 persons and it was a little bit uncomfortable for me but I like how it's a private room. Also it's about 4,200 yen taxi drive from Namba.    The dish I enjoyed the most was in the attachments. It's called Mizumono - Fruit balls with honey jelly. It was a very fun dish with different flavors of peeled fruit balls."

Kashiwaya,20,So sad...,"Of all the Michelin Star restaurants in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, this was the restaurant we were most excited about. I’m really bummed to have to write this review... On paper, 3 Michelin Stars, Relais Chateaux, $400 per person... It sounded like the meal of a lifetime, right? NOT. The restaurant has many rooms, most of which are tatami floor seating style. We were led to what looked like an interrogation room with a table large enough for 10 people, 2 Western chairs, no artwork on the walls and dated decor. Not even old charm Japanese, just old and frankly creepy. No music and the incessant sliding door opening and closing with a rusted metallic sound... We were totally creeped out. We had to start playing a little background music from our phones to get a some kind of atmosphere. Rude of us? Maybe, but I swear, the room had this awful fluorescent lighting, not at all the “cocoon feel” I had read about in the reviews.  THE FOOD: just plain boring. No flavors, nothing exciting at all. Is the Chef so well known that he keeps getting the ratings he received 20 years ago?  The sake/wine tasting at $90 per person consisted of $12 bottles anyone could find at the corner supermarket. Not good at all.  Service was lovely. Therefore my giving the place 2 stars.    We walked out of there, thanked everyone politely and burst into laughter once in the taxi. Never have I spent $900 on a meal for 2 that was so below average. Not to mention the restaurant is a 45 minute drive from the center of Osaka.    SO DISAPPOINTING."

Kashiwaya,50,Wonderful experience,"With the presentation and preparation techniques used it's easy to understand why they were awarded Michelin stars, staff are wonderful, restaurant is lovely, very enjoyable"

Kashiwaya,50,"""you will experience a harmonious culinary meditation appealing to almost all the senses""","in other words, this will be one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat. why? let me count the ways:    (1) the peaceful setting in a traditional tatami mat room (with a seat and room for legs below the just-above-floor-level table, for the less flexible or more long-legged among us) in a traditional house incongruously next to a freeway in an otherwise quiet mid-north osaka neighbourhood.    (2) the gracious and welcoming greeting on arrival - and, depending on how busy they are, possibly even from grand chef hideaki matsuo and/or his wife proprietress katsuko matsuo.    (3) the unobtrusive, professional yet empathetic service throughout the time at kashiwaya - in our case, for all four hours of our visit.    (4) and, of course, that ""harmonious culinary meditation"" befitting of a restaurant with those coveted three michelin stars...all 12 courses so beautifully designed for the eye, so carefully prepared for the fragrance and flavour and texture.    we were fortunate enough to have visits from the head chef and proprietress during our meal. they kindly explained the back stories involved in choosing the food items and combinations, the preparation and presentation - and the relationship with topics ranging from historical traditions to the season and even the day's weather.    in the TripAdvisor article i wrote following a visit a year ago i explained more about the back stories and a little bit about the head chef's relationship with food when he's not at the restaurant, so i won't repeat those details here (like his favourite food, and what he does if he's invited out for a meal which wasn't as good as it might have been).    in the attached photo montages of our lunch, i've included the menu we enjoyed - ""Aotsuyu - rain dropping among leaves"" and indeed it was lightly raining that day.    this was only my second three-michelin-star restaurant experience (the other was in paris). but it certainly was an experience to savour, in all senses of the word."

Kichisen,40,Great experience,"We visited Kichisen for lunch and had a great experience. The food was traditional Japanese presented beautifully and creatively. We had a set tasting menu and left feeling full and satisfied. The staff were fabulous, very friendly and professional."

Kichisen,50,Excellent Kaiseki,"Iron Chef Tanigawa’s lidded creations of gochiso left a deep imprint of how exquisite each of the courses presented to us. Coupled with undivided attention and service, this Kaiseki experience has been one of the best we had in Japan."

Kichisen,50,Kaiseki as it should be,"Kichisen was not our first choice in Kyoto but since we had not managed to get reservations at two other places we were glad to be able to book it for lunch. I specifically wanted a traditional Kaiseki meal –something more conventional than the excellent Ryugin in Tokyo – and that’s what we got. I am not able to compare it to other top Kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto, but we were certainly not disappointed. The lunch menu we had chosen was more limited in scope than the Chef’s omakase (twice as expensive), but it was still very good and beautifully presented. It is worth reading a bit about kaiseki before you go as you can understand and appreciate it more. Kichisen has 3 Michelin stars and I can imagine that for some people it may not be in the same league as the best 3-star international restaurants one is used to e.g. in Europe. But judged on its own terms and in the proper context it delivers exactly what it should. The whole experience (taking one’s shoes off, seating at the counter, the progression of dishes, sake, courses resembling still-life decorated with autumn leaves) was definitely worth it and offered a glimpse into an important part of Japan’s culinary culture."

Kichisen,50,Wonderful experience,Everything about this restaurant is about attention to detail - from the moment you arrive to the preparation and presentation of the food. It was an amazing experience but be prepared for the amount of food and the period of time you are there. This is all part of the experience as is hearing the chefs in the kitchen and appropriate waiting time as each course is freshly prepared. Given the cost - it needs to be a special dinner for you. The presentation of the food is amazing. It is a chefs menu.

Kichisen,40,Artsy and scrumptious treat,"Over ten dishes which cooked with seasonal ingredients, the presentations and flavors wowed us so much. Chefs introduced every dish and service was decent. The downside was no music and heard the cooking and washing sounds (We sat by the bar table)."

Kichisen,50,Excellent!!,"Wasn’t sure what to expect after reading the wide ranging reviews on this place. We really enjoyed the ~14 course menu (23k JPY/person) in a private room and found it excellent and totally worthy of 3 star experience. Obviously as ‘the most traditional kaiseki in all of Japan’ the food and overall experience is extremely ‘Japanese’ and very different than western restaurants. But the level of ‘art’ and complexity that went into each dish was amazing and the ‘flow’ of each course, presentations and flavors/ingredients used made for an extremely unique culinary experience. If you’re expecting/looking for a modern/fusion or ‘molecular’ experience that’s not what this place is about – if you’re interested in authentic Kaiseki, this is the place."

Kichisen,50,"Kichisen has it all – fabulous food, friendly staff and so much fun!","One of our reasons to travel to Japan was to sample Kaiseki cuisine in Kyoto. I did a lot of research on the restaurants with three Michelin stars and decided to make a reservation at Kichisen. What a splendid choice! My husband and me had a marvellous meal and a truly unforgettable experience.    Upon arrival we were greeted warmly by an armada of staff and had the whole room with the counter seats for us. We are both pretty tall and had no problem to accommodate ourselves. World-famous chef Yoshimi Tanigawa and his kitchen team (only 7 people altogether) were all extremely friendly, kind and eager to explain not only the food itself, but also its way of preparation and deeper meaning of the presentation – in English! Our biggest luck was a young chef from Macau who was at Kichisen for an internship and took extremely good care of us.    The interior is very subdued and will not distract one from the fabulous food. All is decked out in light wood, the countertop feels smooth and warm and the simplicity of both the glasses and the chopsticks (handmade by a local shop and definitely not form the “dollar store”) leaves all the attention for the tableware. All courses were beautifully arranged and we were amazed by the diversity of little bowls, plates and boxes. Some of these were more than 100 years old and can cost a couple of 100.000 Yen.    We chose the Kaiseki course for 28.000 Yen, expressed our love for seafood and asked for tap water as the adjoining park has some of the finest spring water which is used in Kichisen - this was a much better option than the bottled water shipped from the other end of the world. We had a bottle of the “Chefs Recommendation” sake, which was 2.000 Yen a bottle and extremely tasty. By the way: you will have to refill your glasses yourself as this is a gesture of courtesy amongst family members and/or business partners and usually not done by waiters as this would be inconsiderate.    But now for the food! Sure enough this is a different style of Haute Cuisine and one has to open her or his mind to immerse into the whole cultural experience. What we happily did! The joy began with two tiny scoops of yuzu and peach sorbet followed by mineral water with a drop of olive oil to prepare the stomach. Kaiseki cuisine follows the seasons and so we were presented with “Rabbit jumps over the moon” consisting of octopus, beef, ginkgo nuts and apple jelly. Inside of the little bunny box was some kind of boiled apple. The freshness of each component and the careful combination made us sigh with amazement. The jelly theme was also present in the next course of milk and wine jelly with rosemary.    Next came the famous dashi broth served with a piece of saury which was cut 20 times in 1 inch to ensure the profusion of taste. We also found some of the lovely maitake mushrooms inside. Our new friend from Macau explained in detail to us how to enjoy the soup: First, we opened the bowl and just smelled at it. Then, we took the first sip. Chef Tanigawa himself came out of the kitchen to transfer the thin slices of citrus to the side of the bowl where we just drank from and we took the second sip – totally different taste! Then, we ate all of the solid ingredients and drank the rest of the broth. Oiishi!    Sashimi was also tremendously tasty – the squid (also cut many, many times) nearly melted on the tongue, the shrimp and some white fish were also of the best quality. The hot sushi was a surprise for us and the thin egg threads on top of it added a nice creamy flavour to the dish.    Salmon. Everyone has eaten salmon in her or his life. But the salmon we were served at Kichisen was a complete game-changer. Fresh in taste and of great consistency, combined with salmon caviar and apple, all arranged beautifully on a bed of leaves and real snow. By the way: The leaves are picked freshly every day in the mountains by chef Tanigawa himself! No high-class sushi without tuna: we were lucky enough to taste the extremely rare “atama”, Bluefin tuna head. The taste was also fresh and clear and so very different from any other kind of tuna we had eaten during our stay in Japan or ever before.    The next course was “catch the fish” – Spanish mackerel, seaweed and chrysanthemum petals in a light broth served on a tiny stove filled with the famous binchotan coal. This may sound like a very simple thing, but again, the combination of different flavours made this another memorable dish.    So much for the fish – now for the beef! A5 grade Wagyu beef to be precise. Chef Tanigawa prepared it right in front of us on a hot stone covered with a super thin pineapple slice. This pineapple slice did not only add a dash of fruitiness to the beef but also prevented it from burning on the hot stone. We were told by the patient young chef from Macau that chef Tanigawa was the first one to have had this idea. We ate the first piece of beef with a dash of rock salt, the second one with citrus – amazing, how different the beef tasted according to the condiments! We wrapped the last bit of beef with local herbs inside of salad, again: different taste.    The rice dish brought us some more of the great maitake mushrooms and farm-ranged chicken, the accompanying pickles were also extremely delicious. Knowing that fruit is something truly special in Japan and also very precious, we were very happy about the melon with milk jelly and flowers and utterly amazed by the taste of the single one grape which ended our dinner. Matcha and Oolong tea were served as the final part.    A special bonus was the opportunity to take a photo with three authentic geiko and meiko. We were so surprised when chef Tanigawa came out of the kitchen, opened the door to the hallway, waved at us to get outside, demanded to take our camera and took a photo of us and the three ladies. We would never ever have dared to even look at them longer than a couple of seconds and suddenly we had this photo of the five of us taken by a three-starred Michelin chef.    But the evening became even better – we had a lovely chat with chef for about 45 minutes about food, karate, Europe & Japan, Michelin stars, movies and friendship (watch out for “Michelin Stars – Tales from the Kitchen” featuring chef Tanigawa) – the young chef from Macau helped to translate. Apart from the outstanding food this was an extremely fun experience! With the final bill of 68.428 Yen we consider this evening an extremely good value for money and we will surely return on our next trip to Kyoto.    Kichisen has it all – fabulous food, welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable staff and the very special personality of chef Tanigawa to make this a night to remember."

Kichisen,50,"This is Kaiseki, excellent Kaiseki, not western 3 michelin star dining","I was hesitant to come here because of all the bad reviews, but actually I found that those were pretty unfounded. I agree that if you're looking for a western dining experience this is not what you will get. The foods feels far too bland for a 3 star restaurant and the service too harsh and decor also far too muted. But if you're looking for real kaiseki in a real Japanese establishment then it doesn't get much better than this. The food is exquisite to the eyes and palate, but if you're like me and accustomed to western food, it will take some getting used to and a lot of focus.  The big gamble was actually on your fellow other customers, who in our case were a couple who proceeded to watch videos and play games on their phone in the otherwise pin-drop quiet restaurant.  But overall, I enjoyed my experience, and really thought that this was actually good value given that other 1 michelin starred kaiseki that we tried in Kyoto were actually no where as exquisite and almost as expensive. (we opted for the 26,000 omakase menu, a good choice we thought, since the lesser menus were not as nice and the more expensive ones were not so different.)"

Kichisen,40,A different dining experience,"My wife had managed to score a reservation here having tried unsuccessfully at other Michelin rated Kaiseki establishments in Kyoto. I've read the multiple polarizing reviews about this place. Some gave rave reviews while a few others absolutely destroyed it. Nonetheless we went for dinner with an open mind albeit with a little trepidation.  We were greeted courteously outside the restaurant and led to a separate room with counter seats. The inside of the restaurant was clean, minimalist, and traditional in design. The counter staff were very friendly and courteous, despite the general air of strict adherence to protocol and behavior. But what do you expect? It is a kaiseki dinner, thus protocol is a must, and is the whole purpose of the experience anyway, so we weren't complaining.  In terms of the food, in summary, amazing presentation and showcase of culinary skill. Most of the courses were delicious, especially the beef and sashimi courses although one or two of the courses were perhaps just a lil bland in taste. Desert was amazing too. Sake prices were surprisingly cheap for a 3 star establishment.  Would I call it a mind-blowing experience? Probably not, but nonetheless it was overall a very good Kaiseki dinner despite the hefty dent in your wallet. Hopefully will be back to try the other establishments in Kyoto the next time round."

Kichisen,10,"Unforgettable bad , ruined experience","Booked this restaurant for special occasion . We've been in number of 1 and 2 Michelin stars restaurants around the world but it was first time for 3 stars so obviously expectations were high like for any Michelin star .    As for any restaurant the rating would be the combination of things such as:    Ambience  Food  Service  Presentation    Presentation and food were not bad ( I would rate 3 out of 5). Even thought we've been given regular wooden dollar store chopsticks - I would definitely expect something at least a little bit more sophisticated from ""3 Michelin star"".    Restaurant decor is very plain and simple . I see Japanese culture a bit more colour full and historical way then it was presented by restaurant decoration but it's my personal view.    Service - really bad.  It started Ok with 2 young men and 2 older ladies ( we had private room for the party of 4) servicing us So 4 people brought us menus and hot towels .    We had pre- set menu for $260 US per person so we just ordered drinks and 2 bottles of Fiji water.    First drinks for my husband and his friend were brought to the room then we have to wait for mine and my friend drinks . Question - why not to bring all drinks together since they've been ordered together . But probably I am picky and asking for too much from 3 Michelin star restaurant .    Drinks were accompanied by regular tap water .    We reminded our waiter(s) that we also ordered bottled water - that's ok some minutes after it was delivered to us and poured to the glasses . And it was first and last time water was poured to our glasses . For the remaining duration of our # of courses dinners we've been taken care of ourself for the water .    Any time we would run out of the drink we had to ask our waiter for the new drink sometimes reminding him ( why him - because number of people servicing us dropped from 4 to 1 person) when he would forget to bring our drink order.    Again maybe I am too picky but I think the above mentioned comments are basic requirements for ""3 Michelin star"".    But for the sake of the argument let's say I am very picky client and above mentioned things should not count for the ""3 Michelin star"" review.    Now let's continue - our friends do not eat shell fish . It has been communicated with the restaurant ahead of time via e-mail and confirmation that this dietary requirement was marked for our menu was received.    Guess what - very first dish has a shellfish. Yes we did get an apology about it but do you think this dish was taken away and replaced with dish with no shellfish?????    NO- dish was left on a table in front of each of our friend with apologize and confirmation that future dishes will not have shellfish ( and this item was not taken away from the bill) . Reminder - we are talking about ""3 star Michelin restaurant"".    We are lucky that our friends just don't eat shellfish. Imagine if it would be someone with allergic reaction on shellfish ???    Culmination of our unforgettable ""3 Michelin stAr"" experience was the presentation on the desert .    We've been told that it's a special surprise and 4 closed black boxes were presented to us.    As waiter started to open them - he realized that he is given us boxes of the people from the other room who just finished this desert .    Yes - we've been given left over of desert of other people. Waiter realized this during opening the second box and with the word - just a second took it away .    With no apologize and/or acknowledgement of what just happened we've been given another desert but by this point we had enough and asked to talk to the owner.    We've been told that main chef is very busy and can't come at this time but my husband insisted to talk to chef once chef knowing that this situation happened in his restaurant will become available for us. But to be honest we didn't had to wait for a long time and chef with waiter come to us within few minutes.    We explained what happen and this is not appropriate for the restaurant of this level . Actually it's not appropriate for any restaurant but especially for ""3 Michelin star"".    Chef apologized AND HIT WAITER TO THE FACE right in front of us and left our private room.  We've been shocked and horrified at the same time. To be honest at this time I started to be concerned for our safety. We've been given our bill of about $1,500 US ( in ""3 Michelin star"" you have to pay for bad experience ) and we immediately left the place.    I was shaking when we left this place. Luckily we had private driver and he was waiting for us outside so we could leave immediately."

Kichisen,50,Great experiece!,"I usually let the michelin guide lead me to  good dining and it was right on the spot again! This is a three starred restaurant so yes, it is a bit expensive (around 200-300 dollars per person) but the culinary and cultural experience are priceless! It is a kaiseki place, we had the full tasting menu, beautiful prepared and presented, with a taste of Kyoto's cuisine. Oh! And do get the counter seats! Definitely recommend it!"

Kichisen,40,Weight of 3 stars,"I don't rate everywhere I go and Kichisen was one of them as I was probably tied up then. Going through Kyoto restaurants on TA today, I came upon Kichisen that I visited for lunch before. Was surprised to see the many extreme opposing views about this place so I decided to give my 2 cents of it.    I chose this Michelin in Kyoto among others because firstly, they were flexible about allowing children. Not only that, they even suggested a specially catered child's menu that eased my wallet and pleased the kid. Secondly, even though it was months ahead, the two other 3 stars restaurants that I was eyeing on were already booked up.    We were greeted and led in by one of their male staff. The restaurant had expected our arrival and greeted us by name. We walked past a counter seat section and was led into a private room. It was a very big and nice room for our small group of three. We were able to look out to a quiet scenery outside.    Since there is a lapse of time since my visit, I won't go into detail of all the courses. But there is one dish that stood out for me and remained in the memory - the dobinmushi (teapot soup). This was an outstanding item. The strong, warm and earthy yet somehow mellow fragrance of the matsutake lingered in the mouth, whereupon squeezing a little of the sudachi fruit (a lime-like fruit) into it immediately rendered a different taste - bright, clean, delightful. Brilliant.    The rest of the items were good, not memorable or groundbreaking. However, I did feel that the transition of courses blended in taste smoothly. Which is important.    Presentation of the courses was above average. I ordered a sake which was good and came nicely presented on a nice, big bowl piled with ice.    The service was not terrible as some reported. At least not the ones I received. The only problem I can point out was two instances. The young waiter was very surprised that he had to address me on the dishes rather than my husband which was the norm in Japan. He had to do that because of the language issue - my other half doesn't speak Japanese. Small matter but it shows his inexperience, I guess. The second instance of a lapse was when towards the very end his introduction of the dishes became just a little shoddy.    We were sent off with deep bowings from three staff.    If you come here expecting a grand affair, where dishes are fanciful and taste is strong, I think you'll be disappointed. I see the food as something like having a quiet time sitting by a park, with a soothing wind gently blowing. Nothing great, just delicate. Oh yeah, the word 'delicate' came to my mind when I was eating. And I thought it's something I might not like as much ten years ago than now, and that I know mom will be the one who really knows how to appreciate the cooking.    Now back to the stars. Does it warrant 3 stars? Personally I think 3 is a little overrated but it is not that bad. But it's pricey so I'll save the yen for another restaurant next time. But the taste of the dobinmushi remains at the tip of my tongue. If it does not have the weight of the 3 stars, some reviews might not be as harsh."

Kichisen,10,Extremely disappointed,Went here for our first night in Kyoto. The service and food was not even on par with what you would expect from an average restaurant. Having dined at other Michelin three star restaurants we expected this to be a memorable meal but this restaurant is undeserving of even one star.

Kichisen,40,Probably just slightly above average.,"Considering it has a 3 Michelin star, a little surprised that it is only just slightly above average compared to the other kaiseki we tried so far.. nonetheless still good but wouldn't go all out to recommend to my friends.."

Kichisen,20,Extraordinary collapse of standard,"Our kaiseki experience in Japan over the years had always been great, until this one. We were met at the restaurant door. The private room we were in was fine. The food was alright, not brilliant, but not bad. However neither the beef nor the seafood served were the top quality, which you expect at a purportedly top class Kaiseki restaurant and for the price charged. The way the dishes were presented were more showmanship than traditional. We had a waiter and a waitress to serve us, both of whom were fairly amateurish in the way they served. Worse still, they were intrusive, and attempt to snatch plates away before we were finished each time. Soon as the last dish arrived the bill came, without being asked for. Considering this was about an hour before their closing time, this was quite extraordinary rush to get us out. We really were left puzzled as how it got any michelin star, or whether the owner had sold their business."

Kichisen,10,An ultimate hypocritical experience,"We have chosen to dine at Kichisen on the last night of our 10 days Tokyo Kyoto trip celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary. It is our 3rd time in Kyoto and the first time we are here without our now grown sons. We have loved the city and our experiences here.  Our dining experience in Kichisen was our worst experience ever in Japan and a close tie to be the worst ever dinning experience we have ever had. The restaurant manage to treat their diners just as bad is Tseng Yang 正陽 a one Michelin star Chinese restaurant in Paris. That is however, a separate story.  My husband and I are very respectful diners, we always show up well dressed with gratitude that we can experience the culture and the cuisine. However, at Kischien, supposingly the epitomy of a Japanese cultural experience, we are treated very poorly.  We were asked to crawl in to a tiny space across the kitchen an annex to a much bigger room which is a normal size private room at such an establishment. It was stuffy and hot and very noisy fron both the kitchen and a young child from the adjacent large room.  The food is decent and they truly have a wonderful dashi broth and an excellent dobinmushi. However, If I know how they would treat us, I would be willing to pay to avoid this experience. We respectfully expressed our disappointment and neither the head waitress/ manager or the management responded. Finally, while waiting for our credit card to be processed for a almost $650 bill for 2, I stepped out of the much larger room we were finally moved into for the rice course, and asked to speak to the boss. He came after a lengthy wait and just say sorry and placed a cardboard box on the table with a plastic bag. It was a white cup with imprint of how the restaurant thank us with gratitude from the 3 Michelin Star chef. How inappropriate a apology gift. I told him that his food is very good but please do not treat another customer the way he treated us. I am not sure he understood his insult to others is not overlooked. Respect has to be mutual, if he does not want to serve tourists or non Japanese, he should do so but not charge us and insult us at the same time. We really are not that desperate for good food to forego our self respect. Look for a much better experience elsewhere in Kyoto. Kikunoi would be a much superior choice.  Chef desperately needs to learn to respect others to deserve any respect as both a person and a business owner. It is most unfortunate for us to waste our precious resources, most importantly our time together on vacation at an establishment that is truly hypocritical in action."

Kichisen,50,3-stars Michelin experience,"traditional Japanese kaiseki-ryori is not only a nice meal, it is an experience, a total experience for your eyes, taste buds and associated with Japanese culture. there are many very top kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto, Kichisen is one of them. everything is meticulous, from restaurant environment to food presentation, from food quality/taste to service, nothing to compliant about. but such high quality meal won't be cheap, bring a loaded wallet! :)"

Kichisen,50,Amazing decoration with good test,"This restaurant is one of three stars restaurant which requires booking with cancellation fee if not before one day. The restaurant is nice and have strange way of getting into the private room through small hole which should be old Japanese style. I choose the 30,000 yen set. The food is very good and very special presentation. The quality and taste is amazing. Not all of them but mostly of them especially the grill steak and melon is very good including all the soup being served. The service is very good with warmth greet and goodbye. I might recommend this restaurant if you have the chance to visit Kyoto."

Kichisen,50,Excellent Michelin dining experience,I went to Kichisen with a group of friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this dining experience. Service was firm but friendly. I would love to go back again.

Kichisen,50,One of The Best,Kichisenn is one of the best high-class Japanese-style restaurant in Kyoto. This is a real Ryotei that has acquired three-star of Michelin Guide. We can experience both polite Japanese reception and traditional cuisine.

Kichisen,10,The worst Japanese restaurant,After visiting third star Michelin restaurants in Tokyo our exceptions were extremely high and so was our disappointment. The food was ordinary and we couldn't eat a few of the dishes that eventually we had to return them. The service was unfriendly and uncommunicative. And the worst part was that we said we are allergic to a certain ingredient but continue to get it any way. The worst Japanese restaurant we ever ate in and worst value for money ever!!

Kichisen,10,The emperor has no clothes,"We just got back to our hotel from a $390 per person omakase dinner. I have been stewing with anger and disappointment. The only redeeming part of this whole experience has been the anticipation of slamming this place on Tripadvisor.    Went with my wife. Thing is, we are adventurous eaters and open-minded, and were looking for a very special, very expensive Michelin star dining experience in Japan.    There is a lot of decorum and a lot of fuss. You walk in and are greeted elegantly by two young gentlemen in traditional garb, asked to remove your shoes and your jacket, and escorted into a tiny room where you are seated at a wooden bar. The Michelin stars and awards are prominently displayed. It is deafeningly quiet and the anticipation builds. You are excited for a sparse setting, a stern yet generous master chef, and the best food you have ever tasted in your life - like a Jiro Dreams of Sushi experience.    Ultimately, what is a great restaurant? It is great food and great hospitality. (Think Danny Meyer) Well, here is the problem. It has neither.    We have been in Japan almost for 2 weeks. The food in this country is stellar! We have had ramen, sushi, okonomiyaki, Chinese food, Italian food, French food, kaiseki, American fast food, American breakfast, and even the train stations and convenience stores have the most amazing little snacks. Our favorite meal was this really authentic little okonomiyaki place in Tokyo where you do the whole thing with taking off your shoes and sitting on the floor. We love Japanese culture and decorum. This Kichisen fiasco was far and away the most expensive and most disappointing experience in the whole country, spanning 6 cities.    We felt like we were constantly being instructed and judged. Look, we pride ourselves on not being 'those heathen Americans' who are disrespectful of the culture. We love this culture and the people here; we have wanted very much to immerse ourselves in the experience. *WE LOVE JAPAN.* But please don't tell me how to eat my soup or how to place the lid on afterwards. And please do not tell me which fishes to dip in soy sauce and which not to, or reach over to my plate with your hands and move things around on my plate once it is served. And please do not grab my wife's hand and show her how to hold a bowl. Somehow, in the midst of all this absurdity, we got hustled into buying a $9 bottle of flat water. How about, I am paying you vast sums for this luxe omakase dinner, so just let me enjoy it how I want, and if I ask for some water, just bring me a glass of ice water and don't charge me for it!    When my wife went to the bathroom, she was scolded about taking off the dining slippers and changing into the bathroom slippers, and was scolded for accidentally walking the wrong direction (there is no signage indicating where the bathroom is). The woman there was like Cruella Deville and gave her a dressing down. I mean, we are paying almost $400 per person, how about some basic hospitality and trying to make us feel comfortable? She was just trying to go pee for crying out loud.    But all of this can be overlooked if the food is actually 3 Michelin star food. Think Seinfeld ""soup Nazi"" episode. We diners will actually accept an abusive relationship if the food is worth it. I can see why some critics have raved. Everything is carefully prepared. Presentation on the plates is artful. There are very interesting aromatics and visuals and delicate ingredients are used in unusual combinations. I get all that. I am a foodie. I am an adventurous eater and eager to embrace cultures and their authentic foods. But frankly, not one thing was actually *delicious*. Just think about that for a second. All that money and fanfare, and there's not a single morsel of food actually tasted good enough on its own merits that I would want to order again ala carte.    The head chef, a kind of self-appointed celebrity (he autographs a memento for you at the end) comes out with this pot of fresh steaming dashi. You are excited and hungry. This soup is going to be amazing, flavored with thousands of years of masterful Japanese culinary tradition. He then takes a brush and very precisely sprinkles some kind of liquid seasoning (perhaps a vinegar) over the soup and serves it to you with masterful elegance. The problem? The broth is bland and in the soup itself there is a plum that is so tart and vinegary that I am almost retching every time I bite into it. I am too afraid to stop eating it because the room is dead silent and I feel that the wait staff is supervising my every bite and judging me by what I leave behind. Speak up and ask for something else? After all, the master took such great care in this. Is there something wrong with me? Is my palate just not sophisticated enough? Meanwhile, there is no music, no conversation, no laughter, no din. We are talking to each other in whispers. We can hear the group next to us slurping their broth. It is so unpleasant!    There is a steak course, in a tiny nod to Western palates. The steak comes out sizzling on a slice of pineapple that is acting almost as a grill pan on top of a hot plate. The steak is tender and perfectly cooked and I am relieved to have something that actually tastes like food, but why does it taste vaguely like pineapple? This is why they award Michelin stars now? Because they took a perfectly delicious piece of beef and made it taste like a pina colada?    Another emblematic moment is when they come out with a super-powerful espresso shot of green tea. They rotate the glass twice and then present it and bow. Very elegant, very traditional Japanese. The problem? The tea itself is basically pure matcha powder and tastes so strong you can't even take more than a tiny sip. Earlier today, I had a hot green tea from a vending machine for 130 Yen and it was like the most perfectly brewed, delicious green tea you could ask for. The irony and the disappointment of this restaurant continue.    All in all, this was a really icky experience. The emperor has no clothes. All these rave reviews and accolades, Michelin what nots, an air of Japanese culinary superiority and fussy people bossing you around, but I would have been much happier eating an $8 bowl of ramen with some friendly locals."

Kichisen,40,First experience in kaiseki lunch,This restaurant is very proper. We book through Voyagin website. This is the first time for Kaiseki meal. Everything was so beautiful.    We just don't get use to with the taste. But I can feel that in every single dish they try to bring the taste of the ingredients.    Good experience for us.

Kichisen,50,Excellence at its best,"We had booked the place well ahead and it was well worth it. The experience was mind blowing. The different courses kept coming. We just lost count. The delicacies were superb. At the end of it, the Master Chef came, met us in a very friendly manner, presented us with the restaurant DVD and a folder about it. Humility at its best."

Kichisen,50,Some of the best kyo-ryori kaiseki in the world,"Tanigawa Yoshimi is the chef at Kichisen. Yes, it's true, he won the Iron Chef hamo competition, but when push comes to shove, he'd have been mortified if he hadn't. And that's the least of his accomplishments.    At the same time, that Iron Chef win tells you something. Hamo is a beloved fish in Kyoto, the pike conger eel. It has more bones than any animal has a right to, and it's vicious and ugly to boot. A good Kyoto chef should be able to transform a live hamo into good food quickly and efficiently... but outside Kyoto, this is a weird, rare skill. Yet what Tanigawa demonstrated in that competition is just how wide a range you can create with this single fish.    Kyo-ryori (semi-formal kaiseki) is sometimes thought very conservative, but a master like Tanigawa creates novelty and tradition at once. On a cold winter's night, he started us with perfect dashi with gold flakes and toasted rice, to warm us up. We discussed the meal. Was there anything we hated? Any particular favorites? Okay, then, we handed it over to him.    As he chatted and joked at the bar, he periodically stepped back into the kitchen -- a school as much as a working kitchen, incidentally -- to make sure everything was to his exacting specifications. Then the dishes began to arrive.    I could tell you everything we ate, but I think the finale best captures the whole. For dessert, he served a gelled chunk of some large citrus we didn't recognize. Perfect, but somehow cold. Then a dish of near-boiling zensai -- perfect, but somehow too sweet, too hot. Then a cup of matcha -- too harsh, but perfect. Then a cup of simple green tea. And somehow we thought, ""now it's perfect, now it's done."" It was as though he was balancing our tastes perfectly, back and forth, winding us toward a perfect -- and perfectly simple -- conclusion.    Yes, it's expensive, especially now that he has those stars. But this is the best kyo-ryori I've ever had. Don't do it if (a) you don't have any Japanese, and (b) you have never had kyo-ryori or kaiseki and don't know what you're getting into. If you're okay on those points, this is a meal you'll never forget."

Kichisen,40,3 Michelin star Kaiseki experience,"I counted 13 courses, but it's hard to be precise because some might have been complimentary amuses bouches. Of course, as with all top-notch kaiseki, the presentation of every dish was flawless. The range of flavors was extraordinary, as it should be when prices are this sky high. I sat at the counter where each course was served with an explanation of the ingredients (+ I was given two printed pages of tasting notes and a DVD to take home). The whole experience is wildly extravagant and over the top, but it's also unforgettable."

Kichisen,50,3 star michelin restaurant and winner of the conger eel battle in Iron Chef,"Kyoto cuisine is said to arise from the infusion of various cooking traditions including imperial court cuisine, samurai cuisine, Buddhist temple cuisine, and tea ceremony cuisine. Kichisen specializes in tea ceremony cuisine and Chef Yoshimi Tanigawa is dedicated to following the 1000 year tradition of pure Kyoto cuisine, abstaining from the overly decorative style that has crept in during recent decades.    There is a certain story, rhythm, and subtle charm which pervades the progression of courses in Kyoto cuisine. It begins with a drink offering called ""sake-ikken"" meaning a sacred sake offered to the gods. After the ""sake-ikken"", an appetiser called ""sakizuke"" is served. Following ""sakizuke"" the meal proper begins. The first dish is a clear soup called ""o-wan"". Kichisen sprinkles drops of dew over the lid of the ""o-wan"" bowl, in order to add a cool and refreshing feeling. There is also a sense that this Kaiseki has been created just for you, never touched by anyone else. In partaking of the soup, please enjoy the smell of the season the moment you open the lid of the bowl. Pepper leaf buds in spring, green citron in summer, yellow citron in autumn and ginger in winter exude seasonal flavors. Take a sip, and enjoy the distinct flavor of the dashi soup stock only available at Kichisen. Dashi made from kelp and bonito flakes is the most essential, and indeed fundamental element of Kyoto cuisine, and is therefore the most important responsibility of the chef. Remove the aromatic ingredients untouched from the bowl, put down the chopsticks, and enjoy another sip. With the flavor of the soup, a delicate sensitivity toward the seasons will permeate throughout your body. Alternately partaking of the morsels in the soup and drinking the broth will enable you to enjoy the soup to the fullest. This completes the first part of the meal.    Next comes the “mukōzuke,” a sashimi (raw fish) dish. Originally from tea ceremony cuisine, the sashimi was placed on the far side (“mukō”) of the rice and soup bowls, which led to this name being used for this dish. The “mukōzuke” dish is accompanied by seasonal condiments, such as mountain pepper, radish, flowering cucumber, oba perilla leaves, “bofu” or Java water dropwort (Japanese parsley), “matsuna,” or Japanese mustard spinach, “iwatake,” or rock tripe (edible lichen), “hasuimo,” or stem of taro, “hojiso,” or ear perilla leaves, Japanese ginger, squash (pumpkin), Malva nut, river weed, Malabar spinach (Malabar nightshades), plum pulp, Japanese red kintoki carrot, Japanese spikenard, kurokawatake mushroom (edible mushroom in the Thelephoraceae family), noble orchid (Cymbidium goeringii), bracken, red manganji chili pepper and smartweed (water pepper). Many of these ingredients also serve as Chinese medicines. Eating them together with sashimi will not only help digestion and absorption, but also enhance the succulent flavor and sweetness of the sashimi. As seasonings, soy sauce and chirisu (a citrus-based vinegar soy sauce mixed with grated radish and smashed leek) are available. If using soy sauce, only a pinch is necessary for sashimi. If using the chirisu, dip the sashimi well into the sauce, and top it with plenty of grated radish.    Then comes the “nakazara” (middle dish) often including sushi or a steamed dish. After the “nakazara,” the flow of dishes quickly builds toward the climax of the menu. Entertaining guests as they enjoy their drinks, Kichisen then serve the “hassun,” a mixed platter of tastes from both the mountains and the sea.    The next dish is a “nimono” (boiled) dish, followed by a “yakimono” (grilled) dish, which are basically considered as the main dishes. The final part of the meal consists of rice and pickled vegetables. Lastly, the meal concludes with fruit, sweets, and powdered green tea."

Kichisen,40,Good Food,Michelin 3 star restaurant serving Kaiseki cuisine. The counter table can seat only 5 persons - they do have private dining room. Like a lot of places in Japan; shoes need to be removed before entering dining area. They have english speaking staff available who can help you understand the ingredients. The food was good - the plates in which the dishes were presented was quite good but felt the actual presentation of food/ ingredients could have been better. The executive chef & his wife meet you on your way out. Staff was very friendly & helpful. Recommend for experiencing Kyoto cuisine.

Kichisen,40,Worthy of its 3 star status,"I ate at Kichisen a couple of nights ago for dinner, the Y17,000 menu. I think there were around 7 courses in total (I lost count to be honest) and had a lovely tour of Japanese cooking in the process.    The quality of the ingredients is outstanding, and other than the tempura (see my other reviews) was the best of each type of cuisine I had whilst in Japan.    I can easily see why this has 3 Michelin Stars; probably doesn't have the sparkle of a Waterside Inn or Restaurant Gordon Ramsay (if you were trying to compare - which is very difficult as they are two totally different concepts) but as good as it gets in Japan.    I definitely recommend to any visitor to Kyoto after something a bit special."

Kichisen,50,Six stars restaurant,"Most impressive kaiseki diner in Kyoto – and clearly among the best meals I ever had, in spite of collecting Michelin star restaurants and other top notch places all year around.  A little bit surprising for a newcomer, with traditional Japanese organization: more staff than clients, you remove your shoes when entering, plenty of people bowing or sitting on the floor and sliding doors for you..,  Food wise, it is a true experience and the restaurant deserves four Michelin star and clearly more than five stars on tripadvisor.  only choice you made it's the one of the price of the menu – it doesn't really affect the number of dishes but only the quality of the ingredients. I went for the most expensive ¥30,000 (out of 15-30,000 range), on the back of observation that I don't plam to be in Kyoto again anytime soon. perfect choice.    The service starts with pickled vegetables including delicious crunchy chestnut, some fish and some local bottarga. This is followed by probably the best dish I ever had in spite of its simplicity: pumpkin mousse with grape jelly and few dots of blackcurrent syrup. plenty of all their dishes to follow with special mention to Kyoto beef cooked on a hot stone, delicious sushi or very good mushroom and fish soup.    Dishes are equally beautiful as they sr good and clearly design represents a big part of fun. A nice selection of Sake or very original and interesting cold teas matching perfectly the food."

Kichisen,50,Unbelievable dinner,"We booked our reservation months in advance. On arrival, we were a bit surprised to find that we had to crawl through a low door into an authentic Japanese tea room, which was quite pleasant. The food was exquisite, and the service impeccable. A memorable dinner"

Kichisen,10,Different charge with the same course,"When reserving my table, I choose 17,000 course. We found nearby customers' course are all the same with us but their bill is lower. We ask restaurant why and they are so panic and took long time to discuss how to explain. The answer is the part of beef are different. We are not satisfied of the answer but still pay the bill."

Hajime,30,Fine Restaurant But Not Good Enough,"Fine restaurant and fine ideas of combining food with earth and nature, reminding me of the Anthologia in Shanghai. Fancy-also-well cooked food are impressive, however a Japanese wine recommended was terrible 😂😂😂 Don’t try! Also the services could be improved."

Hajime,50,Wonderful and delightful evening.,"The entire staff was welcoming, friendly and gracious. The food was spectacular. Or dinner was visually beautiful, delicious and very satisfying. Thank you to the Chef and very fine team."

Hajime,50,Absolutely fantastic!,"We picked the standard menu and loved every dish! We also ordered a bottle of Japanese white wine (as recommended) and to our surprise, it was very very good! Hajime is expensive but well worth every $$$ in my opinion. Highly highly highly recommend!"

Hajime,50,Stunning meal in minamalist setting,"Hajime serves French-Japanese fusion in a stark, minimalist setting. There is seating for around twelve people, but the tables are widely spaced and the personalised service is very attentive. Hajime offers two omekase menus and we chose the ""smaller"" seven course menu which was more than enough for us in spite of the fact that each individual course was made up of multiple albeit minuscule portions of ingredients, all presented as if designed by an artist.The courses have themes, e.g., green(myriad leaves); life (small lives); river(school of fish), etc. which may sound a bit pretentious, but the ingredients are remarkable and included rare varieties such as cherry salmon; firefly squid; mantis shrimp; fois gras with Asian hazel, pumpkin and black pepper covered in a thin layer of candied sugar, etc. Each course was delectable, particularly the penultimate course which included a piece of grilled lamb that was probably the finest we have ever tasted. A wine/sake pairing is available (including Chateau d""Yquem 1999 for the foil gras course). My only quibble is that the wine servings are a bit on the small side given the price (16,700 JPY per person). Hajime is not for everyone, but is a delight for gourmets and well worth a (very expensive) visit for a unique dining experience."

Hajime,50,Perfection,Food was amazing. The wine pairing was one of the best value wine pairing I have ever had. The whole meal was a very cohesive experience thematically. Service was also good. Very expensive but well worth it.

Hajime,50,perfect,what a beautiful restaurant. only very few tables with a total of ten guests that evening. the food looks stunning and tastes incredibly good. very friendly and perfect service. why this restaurant lost its 3rd star is only known by michelin...

Hajime,20,Do 3* restaurants have Off-Nights?,"I guess you got the answer. What should have been an exhilarating gourmet evening ended with much disappointment. It was an evening of two halves - a very poor start with some appetisers which luckily was salvaged by the mains.  Unfortunately the one mis-step proved to be a 3* Michelin terminator as far as I'm concerned. For a restaurant like Hajime to serve Uni that's gone off is totally unacceptable and frankly, incomprehensible. And for restaurant staff to insist initially that it was the freshest Hokkaido Uni despite my comments clearly showed a restaurant that's forgotten who the customer is. It took an emergency meeting in the kitchen to finally elicit agreement that the Uni was indeed off.  And we were only into our first half hour of a three and a half hour marathon dinner.  And why do the service staff have to be so surly in demeanour? It's meant to be a joyous occasion, not a wake!  The much talked about signature Planet Earth was beautifully plated but screamed for some seasonings to bring it up a few notches. Thankfully, the lamb and pigeon mains were sublime. The restaurant rightfully compensated through a discount and the cost of three glasses of wine.  As we were leaving for the waiting taxi out front, we were told Chef wanted to come meet us, ostensibly we thought, to apologise and explain. We waited, and waited and waited...: no show, after at least 8 minutes of waiting. Sayonara."

Hajime,40,"Great food, but too expensive","My partner and I went to Hajime recently, mainly because of their michelin star rating and it was listed as the 14th best in asia. The food was great, very artistic and super impressive. We had 16 courses, all cooked brilliantly. Sadly you cannot take pictures which I think is a bit silly.    The downside for me is the price, dinner for two people costs almost $700usd. That's without anything to drink. If I could choose this experience again to put it simply I wouldn't go, while in Japan we went to two other michelin star restaurants which costed just over half of what Hajime did."

Hajime,40,Japanese and Frech flavours,"Loved the cuisine at this place, we really enjoyed the set menu, which had a Japanese and French influence to it. The service we got here was great, the staff were all really helpful and friendly. We had a great night here, wonderful experience."

Hajime,50,One of the best,"I was expecting a lot and I must say it was even more of what I expected. This restaurant comes for me at the top together with Can Roca. We took the long menu since we wanted to get the signature dish ( planet earth ). I must say we ended up loving all menu and the signature dish, though good, in my opinion is worse than other dishes. The artistry behind each dish and the tastes are sublime. The only one that got me is average was the foie. The rest, an experience on every single dish. Really a lovely experience"

Hajime,50,Well presented seasonal local food,We had the full tasting menu of around 11 courses. Each course we're well presented especially the Earth dish which had 85 different vegetables laid out in the shape of the earth. The lamb and pigeon were excellent - succulent inside and crispy outside. The owner Hajime personally met with us at the end. Highly recommended - I place it well above Tetsuya in Sydney and but below Narisawa of Tokyo in terms of ranking.

Hajime,50,Perfect in every way - food art,"Dining at Hajime is an experience for all senses rather than just the taste buds. Visually the food is simply beautiful as is the tableware it is served with and on - a gallery of food sculpture. There is theatre in the way it is presented and served. The intricacy of presentation is cryptic, challenging the brain to figure out how things were constructed. The combination of flavours and textures is perfect. There is even an aural experience in some of the dishes. The restaurant only seats around 16 and the tables are set well apart from each other to ensure privacy and intimacy for diners. Service is fine dining at its best. The wine and alcohol selection is vast and obviously top end but with a good range of reasonable choices (and the markups are not ridiculous). Despite all I have described above, the experience is still a really relaxed and comfortable one. The staff are friendly and engaging and provide very good natured tips on how each dish should be eaten. The 16 course menu is a lot of food - but just in the right size portion for each course and the right amount in total to walk out feeling full but not overly so. Nothing too crazy that would offend unadventurous palates either. It would be a waste not to walk in feeling hungry though, and as delicious as the bread is, go easy on it! I have no idea why Hijame lost his 3rd Michelin star but admire the integrity he has in serving what he believes is the right menu in the right way, despite this. A very special place. Guests are provided with a gift afterwards and the meals are timed to end so each party leaves separately and is personally farewelled by the gracious host and chef himself."

Hajime,50,execellent,"wow this restaurant is amazing. the taste, the service, the quality of alcohol selection is the best. i came here for valentine dinner, since i need to spend my valentine away from my other half, so i decided to treat myself good. so i went by myself. they are very nice, accepted 1 person reservation and they make some conversation with me so i dont feel so lonely. unfortunately, picture taking is forbidden during dinner. but believe me this restuarant is a must try. i spend $450 for the shirt tasting with half of the wine tasting. the chef make green tea jam for us to bring home."

Hajime,50,Best birthday dinner ever!,"My husband took me to Hajime for my birthday and it was absolutely spectacular!    When we walked in the hostess informed us that we are not allowed to use our phones to take photos of the food because it is at optimum temperature to eat when served and the extra minute or so to take pictures will affect the experience!    The decor of the place was minimal so we spent all our energy focusing on the dishes which I must say were delicious, beautifully prepared and made from super fresh ingredients.    As anyone who's been to Hajime will say, the Chikyu was stunning and scrumptious. I've never had a vegetable dish like it and would recommend anybody to try it.    My husband informed them that it's my birthday so they prepared a few extra desserts for us which were all awesome. They did allow one pic of my birthday ""cake"" which I've uploaded.    We even had the chance to meet Mr Hajime Yoneda! Recommend to anyone who is a true foodie!"

Hajime,50,Enjoyable and exceptional dining experience. Expensive but worth it!,"Phenomenal dinner - 16 dishes (a complementary secret dessert) with wine pairing, very creative and surprisingly delicious for every dish. The chef must be a perfectionist. Exceptional food presentation, perfectly matched tableware, minimal restaurant decoration to give all the focus onto the table... Everything so well done!"

Hajime,50,Absolutely the best night in Osaka,It's absolutely a memorable night for me and my family. The ideas of every course are amazing and I LOVE the main course chikyu. Hajime had prepared a birthday secret gift for my mom and she was really surprised.

Hajime,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"This is a true once in a lifetime experience. Not only awe inspiring, but the personal service made this a really special experience that I would love to live again. After our meal the Chef Hajime San himself came out of the kitchen and introduced himself as we were leaving and thanked us for coming to his restaurant with a small gift. Really a very special experience."

Hajime,50,"Excellent meal, but clearly very expensive","I was surprised to read about the no photo taking rule, but as I am aware some restaurants have similar rules, I abided by it. The dishes were all like pieces of art and we wished we could take pictures. So instead of taking pictures, we took time to admire the various dishes.    The service is good and attentive. If you book at least a month in advance, you may get your reservation confirmed. Be sure to tell them what you do not eat at the time of booking and they will revise your menu accordingly.    All these come at a price, and a pretty steep one at that. So be prepared to pay and enjoy the experience."

Hajime,30,Does it deserve a 3 star?,"from my humble experience on Michelin starred restaurants, I seriously don't think this restaurant deserve a three star (or in which it has dropped to a 2 star restaurant now). the food, service and atmosphere make me have such an opinion that it does not deserve a 3 star.    When we first arrived, they gave u a long list of rules which you have to comply with. No photo taking and etc. my first impression was like ""Jesus Christ!! Am I in my primary school now? I'm paying so much for a dinner and the restaurant has to be so strict? How can I enjoy the dinner if I would need to have so much constrain?"" With such rules, it has already made me feel uncomfortable in the beginning.    As I came with a group of friends, my friends were chit chatting and I was in need to send an urgent business email while the food (forgotten which dish) has just arrived. The waiter came to me and asked me to stop taking pictures. I was like ... seriously?? you can't be any more rude. I was not even paying attention with the dish yet (as the staff hasn't started to explain what's on the table) Then I told him I was just sending an urgent email. I was like even if I really took pictures, does it really a big deal?! (And I saw pictures are everywhere in tripadvisor, you just can't stop people's freedom from doing so.    Then I guess 5-10 mins before the next dish arrive, my friend was in need to goto the washroom. The act of the waiter shocked the whole table. Guess what? He stopped my friend and said the next dish is coming please stay at the table. HAHAHA we really laughed out loud ""ridiculously"". It's my very first time to hear such command from a waiter. With my humble experience, even the 3 stars restaurant in Paris won't do such things. They will just ask the kitchen to hold it for a short while and serve the food again when the guest is back from the washroom. Plus in the present case, it still has about 5-10mins time before the dish would be served on table.    Food: tbh, it's not stunning or a big wow to me. Totally not because of the service which we have encountered. I'm commenting it separately and without bias. The signature dish ""Earth"" looks really beautiful, served with such a big plate, but the heated veggie salad seriously tasted awkward to me. Yet it could not be denied that every dish is a piece of artwork and effort could be seen. The duck was cooked nicely. Overall, the food presentation is really beautiful but the taste of the food is not a wow. Therefore, it's a bit too expensive, as it does not worth that much.    Conclusion: I think without such harsh rules, the guests would be happier, as food should be eaten happily and freely. Too much boundaries would make the whole atmosphere very tense. My friends and I didn't enjoy the dinner much, as it seems like we would get a demerit point from the disciplinary teach if we got one wrong move. I hope improvement could be done regarding the service and the rules."

Hajime,50,Truly one of the best!,"Contender for one of THE most memorable meals I have ever had! As you would expect, it is a degustation menu and I highly recommend you go for the wine and sake pairings. Absolutely flawless in flavour, variety and presentation. Quite simply, the perfect meal! Worth every penny. I couldn't help but be in awe of the chef!"

Taian,50,Not What I Expected But Still Wonderful,"To start, if you're coming to Taian to have a typical ""Michelin rated restaurant"" experience, you should reset your expectations. It is a great restaurant and we enjoyed it thoroughly, but it isn't what we've typically had from that style of restaurant.    The food was universally excellent, and my sense of things is that the vision of Taian is to provide a very high level of traditional and seasonal Japanese cuisine. We had dishes that were absolutely phenomenal, and some things where I just didn't really like it. Not that it was poorly prepared, but it just wasn't something that was to my palate.    There are two quirks of the menu. The first is that while it's mostly a tasting menu, you do get to pick the main course from a list. I went with the short rib that was mentioned by others here as being good, and it was delicious.    The second difference is that you can choose the number of pairings. In our case we went with the full pairings which basically adds a glass of champagne to the beginning of the meal. The champagne was more of a bonus pre-dinner drink that came slightly before the first course and its pairing of a glass of sake.    Overall I was happy with the choice even if it wasn't exactly what I'd expected when I booked it. Arguably that's a good thing as I think it was something new to me, which is part of the point of traveling to someplace you don't know."

Taian,30,Mixed feeling…,"Dinner last night at this Michelin 3 stars was a mixed feeling. I walked into the restaurant thinking that it’s the wrong address. It seems a bit run down, only the chef with his assistant and the wife (server) for the 16 seaters restaurant. The food didnt comes with an impressive presentation, but thanks goodness some of the dishes hit the spot (the main course which grilled on charcoal) The chef didn’t talk or trying to speak but occasionally smile at you. I still wonder how they got the 3 but overall a pleasant dinner."

Taian,50,Amazing in all Aspects,"It is quite difficult to describe my dinner at Taian in Osaka, only to say it was an incredible meal in so many aspects. I've been to around twenty 3 stars, though mainly in Europe, and Taian certainly rates amongst the very best of these. Taian is quite small and intimate, seating 12 or 14, with the majority of the seats at the counter. Watching chef Takahata-san and his team prepare the dishes was a highlight in itself. Having lived in Tokyo for 7 years, Taian certainly is at the very pinnacle. ごちそうさまでした"

Taian,40,3 Michelin Star that has a unique dimension,"I don't think Taian is for everybody because their tasting menu can be quite acquired in taste. I came here around August and since its Anago season, Anago was one of the memorable dishes plus the ginger stuffed with uni dish. Great meal for someone looking for a different taste of Osaka other than street food"

Taian,20,Dinner,"Came here for dinner. Have been to quite a few Michelin Star restaurants in the past. The food was bland, service was average. Definitely wouldn’t be back. Would have been much happier eating at Ichiran down the street."

Taian,50,Simplicity,"True three star class, yet with the feeling that we ate at someone’s home. We took the course menu and the spare ribs. Beautiful simplicity: no unnecessary fanciness! Outlier was the otherwordly dessert."

Taian,30,Bit disappointed,I’m disappointed with the Michelin 2-star rating after my dinner experience here. Food ingredients were ok but flavors a bit average. Dish displays were quite average while the restaurant decoration was quite old. English level of serving staff here was above average though.

Taian,50,Incredible,"Omakase steak menu. Some of the small dishes were a bit bland to be honest but the bigger once were just amazing. The bonito and conger eel sashimi was fantastic. Opted for the spare ribs as mai!c they were out of this world, easily the best ribs I’ve ever had. Service was spotless."

Taian,30,Overhyped and underdelivered 3 Michelin star eatery,"After a painful process involving multiple emails on TableAll just to get a reservation, we were excited about eating in what was described as one of Osaka's Michelin 3 star restaurants. We were seated at the counter where we watched owner/chef Hitoshi Takahata prepare our kaiseki meal. The service was average, as was the food. After spending three weeks in Japan, I know what's good and what's not. The sushi here was not the best quality. The presentation was below par. The only thing that was high was the price. It was also a bit distressing that all the other guests at the counter spent most of their time looking at their cell phones. Not a good sign!  There was one course that stood out as good, the ribs. Other than that, it was not memorable."

Taian,40,"Great meal, but 3 Michelin star??? I'm not sure about that...","I'm prefacing this review by saying that I have only dined at one other Michelin star restaurant...Le Bernardin. So I am basing my review on that. I was holding this restaurant to a lot higher standard with more expectations. Also, I love to eat, but am not sure I have the most sophisticated palate. With that said, we really wanted to try a special restaurant while in Japan. For those of you who have visited Japan before, you will know that it is pretty hard to make a reservation. Restaurants there are not known to be friendly to foreign visitors. They aren't big and don't have lots of seats. And most don't speak english. So the main ways you can go about making dining reservations is via hotel concierge or third party concierge. My friend booked via TableAll. We just wanted to try a Michelin star restaurant and found Osaka to be easier. We were initially ecstatic to have gotten a reservation at Taian (a 3 star). HOwever, after doing some research, I wasn't sure what to expect. Meal price, including Tableall fee was around $200 per person. Most other 3 star restaurants were going for a lot more. This should have been the first sign. We got reservation for Thursday night at 8pm.  Ambiance/Location: We took a cab and he dropped us right in front of the restaurant. There is not English sign for it out front, so I went based off of pics I saw of it. The restaurant had only 1 table (set up for our party of 4) and bar seating (maybe 10-12 seats). Aesthetically it was very simple and decorated in typical Japanese fashion. Restroom was very clean.  Service: Excellent throughout. The main server spoke decent English. Everything was explained properly. For the most part, the service was great, just not sure if it is 3 michelin star worthy. For example, water was not served until requested (not sure if this is a Japanese thing or not). Meals were not brought out together (they would serve us 1-2 at a time and then go back to the kitchen for the other plates). The timing of the food was pretty good. NOt too slow, not too fast. Cool aspect was that sake glasses were all different and we got to pick our own glass. YOu are allowed to take pics of the food, just not of anything else. Server was very friendly. Chef and server walked us out (pretty neat). For anything other restaurant, I would have thought that service was fantastic, just not sure if it is 3 star standard.  Food: My expectation of it was to be blown away...and I was not. Food overall was great, but once again, I wasn't floored by it all. IT was a typical Kiseki menu. The previous reviews hit most of the dishes right on the head. All were unique with good flavor. There were a couple of weird items that my colleagues didn't like. I tried everything and really had no bad things to say about it. I appreciate trying the new items. They had these small fried fishes that you ate like fries...pretty good. There was a soup (egg drop with seafood) that was pretty good. Very clean flavors. I loved the sushi/sashimi. The fish was sea bream i believe. IT was a tad difficult to understand the explanation of the server. I loved the fact that you could choose your entree. I just did't like the fact that there was an upcharge for the beef (wagyu?) and fish dish. We tried the beef (cooked perfectly and was pretty damn good), short ribs (also cooked nicely), and sea bream. The fish was flaky and well seasoned. The biggest disappointment to me was the rice. I was expecting big and bold flavor (from either beef marrow or something), yet it was bland. Dessert was a fruit jelly of some sort and that was good as well. The sake selection was ok, and was priced fair. We didnt try anything else.    Overall it was a great dining experience, just not sure if the 3 stars are justified. I would not need to return, and would recommend trying another restaurant if you can get reservations."

Taian,10,Disappointing,"Minimal choices. Seafood dishes without flavor or proper preparation. Several items completely inedible. Service uncaring, rude and disoriented. Beverage menu extremely limited. Overall a very disappointing experience. We left hungry and frustrated"

Taian,30,Traditional Japanese,"No theatrics just Simple Japanese food. Perhaps with 3 stars I was expecting some frills. The ingredients were undoubtedly fresh, like how most Japanese restaurants would pride themselves. Very light tastes, nothing your tastebuds would shout about. Perhaps it's just me but this was rather underwhelming. The beef however was melt-in-your-mouth with just the right amount of fat sublime."

Taian,50,Someone whom I found to be a born chef,"The three 3-star Michelin restaurants in Osaka are : Kishikawa , Koryu and Taian .    We visited the first two the nights before . They made me tremble : the former with joy and the latter with disappointment.    So , we were in Taian and the impression was good as it has a friendly ambience .    The first plate with five varieties of small dishes made one wonder what the ingredients were ; pleasing of course .    The second dish is a fish soup , or was it a painting made of vegetables and gold grains ? The after- taste was strong and lingered in my mouth with a most pleasant aroma.    The main dish deserved special mentioning . We ordered beef , spare ribs and chicken . While the chicken was good , with crispy skin , the beef was superbly handled with three rings : A crispy outer one , a thin layer of fat and a large portion of medium - rare meat, to show how top grade beef should be cooked . The scrumptious spare ribs made one hate the name ""spare"" as it turned out to be a noble cuisine, guaranteeing that even the best cook would find it hard to match the skill needed .    The rice ( not fried rice ) which came almost at the end is a grand combination of plain rice , red pepper , spring onion and dried fish . The chef used a lot of energy mixing them . I would not let this chef make this rice in China as the humiliated Chinese chefs would certainly beat him up .    The conclusion was that if the current standard could be maintained , this restaurant should be upgraded as one of the first four - starred Michelins , if an extra star is added to the present system .    Just as you think you could grade the food , the last surprise appeared. I would not divulge the ingredients of it : the dessert ..."

Taian,40,"The mains are amazing, but some dishes are not as good.","The wagyu is amazingly good, so is the grilled white fish option. However, the rest of the dishes are either a hit or miss. (Please note that this could be affected by the fact that we're not hungry at that time.)    The oyster soup was really light, perfect to balance the previously savoury five mini appetisers. (Yuba w/ wasabi—this one is great to increase our appetite, scallop puree(?)—a tad to salty for me, yam chips, sea cucumber w/ daikon and one other dish that I can't recall.)    Next is a fugu sashimi. They came in varied textures, which is nice, but the only thing I tasted is the sauce that go with it. The fish itself is pretty much tasteless. That's my first fugu, so I guess I'm just not a big fan of it. Definitely a miss for me. We're also served a yellowtail sashimi, which has more flavour. The sauce went well with this one too.    Next came the wagyu, which as I said before, is fantastic. Each slice is very flavourful and is not tough at all. My dad also enjoyed his grilled fish.    After that, we have deep fried shirako with lemon and salt. I personally like this preparation of shirako. It's crunchy on the outside and really creamy on the inside. Definitely a hit.    Next is a crab dish with mushroom and spinach. I'm not a big fan of the sauce, and found them average. This one's a miss.    Next, we have a ochazuke kind-of dish, with fugu fin soup as the base instead of ocha. The soup is nice and savoury, with a hint of tartness. Very refreshing.    The dessert is some sort of jelly with numerous toppings inside it (some beans, peas, and fruits). It's light but doesn't please my tastebud as much.    Overall, it's a pretty pleasant experience. The chef and the server accompany us to the door. They are very amiable."

Taian,50,Best Wagyu and Spare ribs at a Michelin restaurant,"Had certainly one of the best spare ribs and Japanese Wagyu beef here in Taian, which is a Kaiseki style restaurant albeit with a more lively environment. Reasonable value for 14000 yen set meals."

Taian,50,Best grill fish I ever have,Booked a seat for dinner at Taian via Nikko Hotel Osaka during my April Kansai trip ! The grill fish is the best I ever have so far ! Sashimi is good as well. Just fried rice and dessert is so so only. The restaurants have 12 counter seats plus a table of 4-6. The set dinner is Yen13k plus Yen2k extra for grill white fish ! I do order a portion of sake & mineral water and all come with bill of Yen19k plus.

Taian,50,Worth all the effort to go there!,"My friend and I went to Osaka since we wanted to experience all the lovely food within this popular area in Japan. Our goal for this holiday was to eat and relax. We wanted to eat in a Michelin starred place since Osaka is famous for having the most Michelin star restaurants. Taian did not disappoint. All the earlier articles and reviews I read couldn't even do justice to the experience I've had with this place. We went there on a Sunday afternoon to eat if there was any space available and if they were unable to fit us in to book for another day. We could only get a booking on the Wednesday. We had a little bit of a hard time finding the place since Google took us on a long route but finally we found the place. It was located on the first floor of a very unassuming building with only a small sign on the front. You enter into a small foyer with the table surrounding the chefs station. You get to choose your main dishes, my friend chose the eel and I chose the fish. All the rest of the food was prepared already. The chief waitress spoke English and she was very helpful with describing the dishes served and how to eat them properly. As in Japan you're given a hot towel to wipe your hands before eating and after that there's another towel left at your table for you to wipe your hands all throughout the meal. All I can say with all the difference dishes prepared was that it was all worth the hype. Our main dishes eel and the fish were heavenly. I have never tasted eel prepared in circular manner like a cinnamon. The fish was so tasty and grilled nicely. The previous dishes were very well prepared. You get small servings for each course. We had the fall in love tea which was served in a clear glass with a round ice. Last dish was the rice and miso soup. It was really an experience! When we went out the chief waitress and the chef himself came to greet us goodbye and showed us the door. Next time we visit Osaka we will have to go back and eat at this place again."

Taian,30,Not worthy of 3 star michelin!!!!!,I have been to numerous Michelin stars restaurant in Japan and Taian is grossly overrated. It's left even more unimpressed when he was talking to one particular diners of three who ordered at least 4 bottles of wine - neglecting the rest!!! To make matters worst he politely send of his Japanese customers after they paid the bill - but completely forgotten about us!!! Do yourself a favour there are lots of better Michelin stars restaurant in Oaska!!!

Taian,20,Not Michelin worth,"We found ourselves with a free evening in Osaka and were excited to be able to secure a last minute reservation. The restaurant is the perfect size and nicely laid out. The food was interesting and on par with some of the better ryokan I have spent time at across japan. That is a pretty poor outcome for a Michelin rated restaurant. I had just eaten at Manresa, a two star michelin restaurant in central California the month before. That experience was like visiting a food artist at his finish. Taian might be a very authentic experience, but either it was lost in translation, or it was simply a fail.    The ramen we had at ippudo was far more unique and memorable."

Taian,30,Choice of the main dish (Kobe beef) was interesting but...,"I had high expectations given its 2 star Michelin ratings but their was no ambience to similar kaiseiki restaurants I have been to in Tokyo and Kyoto. The counter was high so the waitress had to reach over the customers to get the plates to be delivered to the diners instead of the chef presenting each dish directly. The food was unspectacular and the presentation was just average. Way over rated although the grilled Kobe (2 slices) steak which they charged extra 2,000 yen over the basic 14,000 was very good."

Taian,30,Outstanding service and decent food,"My friend and I booked a dinner at Taian through the concierge of the hotel we were staying prior to our arrival. The restaurant requires a credit card to secure the booking and there's a cancellation penalty for no-show. Being a 3 Michelin star restaurant, my expectation was high and unfortunately this place didn't exceed my expectation. The good was good and the presentation outstanding. The service was inconsistent and we were left with our glasses empty a few times."

Kikunoi,50,Must try at least once,"When in Kyoto, you must have a kaiseki dinner. Google and Tableall listed this as a top kaiseki place with 3 Michelin stars. We booked for their premium dinner. Total was about CAN$1000 prepaid. I have had kaiseki dinners in North America but never Japan. My ratings:  Service 10/10 (very attentive, large private room, waterfall garden in the backyard, personal server); Food 9/10 (the idea is to let the fresh ingredients speak for themselves, minimal salt, super fresh, abalone, uni, muscat grapes, are some highlights);  Ambiance 10/10 (dine like royalty); more in my photos"

Kikunoi,50,Must try,"I read the reviews, and I was worried about this booking. This place was absolutely wonderful. Fantastic cuisine. Really delicious, they wet so kind and the food was absolutely amazing. We will return. 👏 Arigato to the whole team. ❤️"

Kikunoi,50,Subarashi! (Fantastic!),A culinary tour de force. Three Michelin stars may not be enough. Sophistication and delicacy beyond belief. The Kaiseki dinner is a journey through a sensory and emotional universe. Subsrashi. Arigato.

Kikunoi,40,Wonderful cultural experience but too much eel,"Beautiful location in the hills above Gion. This was a cultural experience with tatami mats and a low table, individual dining rooms, spectacular service by kneeling women in kimonos, multiple small courses of artistically arranged food, peaceful view of trees and garden, quiet and private. You choose which level of ingredients to pay for and that sets your menu...I think ours was a middle price range, over 500 USD for 2 people. So while it was a once in a lifetime experience, I hate to say it, but for the price, I was a bit disappointed in the food. We were very excited for a different culinary experience, but we are not tremendously fond of eel. One dish had a bit of eel sashimi and that was fine, but another dish was completely eel sashimi, and the big rice dish near the end was eel with rice. I was, as I said, a little disappointed. Otherwise, the experience was wonderful."

Kikunoi,30,Kikunoi Honten disappointed me,Kikunoi honten is very disappointing. One could never imagine that they servic sharkfin soups in Kyoto. No style. Dishes are more than disappointing for the price.

Kikunoi,50,"Simple, no fireworks, absolute perfection.","This meal isn't about fireworks, razzle dazzle, or showing off. It's about simple perfection, elegance, and perfect execution. We'll always come here.    We had to walk over a mile in the snow back to our hotel because a cab could not pick us up. We didn't care. It was fabulous."

Kikunoi,20,Don’t go for the FOOD!!!,"Most beautiful restaurant a person can go to, the cerimonial service was immaculate, the garden that was right outside our private room was to die for. But the most important element in any restaurant, the FOOD, was tasteless, uninspired, wrapped in this gorgeous presentation and completely tasteless. The best part of dinner was the sashimi for me and the persimmon that came as a plate for one of the servings. I’ll will never forget of how bad the food was. At one point I thought they were pranking me and for 3 hours I was apologizing to my wife. If anyone thinks that it was just me being a foreigner and not getting the Japanese cuisine i ashore you that’s not the case because my ryokans breakfast and dinner was 10 times better.  If you want to waste your money go for the pictures and experience of being served like a emperor, not for the FOOD."

Kikunoi,50,"WOW, beyond what I (we) was (were) expecting","As I plan my next trip to Kyoto, and trying to get another booking, I have finally gotten around to reading my notes and photos and having time to reflect on this gastronomic experience.    If you are coming here for a meal or because it is 3 Michelin (which I found out after I booked - I booked because I had the Chef's Kaiseki book), probably not a good idea. You come here to experience Japanese culture, at its finest.  Do your home work about the positron of restaurant, the family's history, tea ceremonies, the Imperial Palace, who does dinners hosted by the Emperor.    This is not dining, this is not food, this is Japanese gastronomy and culture at its finest - embodied in the craftsmanship of the Chef and his team in food and drink.    I read the reviews on here, particular the bad ones - i eat at 3 Michelin all the time and so on - they have all missed the point. Reading his book and his trip to France as a young man, what he returned with from that experience, the history (that I am not putting here but invite you to do your home work), why do you drive through a Tori to get to the restaurant? what does that actually mean about the land the restaurant is on, the park land next to the restaurant...... it is all part of the story and the experience.    Yes this is not a cheap restaurant but think about this logic - when you put the first dish in your mouth the flavors remain, so the next dish builds on that - and so on for each course - very different yo you picking an entree, main and dessert based on your favorites not thinking about the flavours that are building in your mouth and do they compliment or compete with each other.    This is the only restaurant I have ever been to where I would consider it to be heaven on earth in the way the whole experience had everything in harmony. (The Buddhist wedding reception and the faint chanting we could hear certainly contributed to us thinking we were in a celestial heaven that evening)."

Kikunoi,50,The best of the best,An explosion of flavor.  A team with good care.  Colourful dishes.  A surprising menu.  Wine just excellent.  Tea and sake a great taste.  Quite expensive. Prepare your budget.  The first price around 14.000 yen is absolutely generous.  Will come back.  Will never forget such a delicious experience.

Kikunoi,30,underwhelming and expensive,"Beautiful stunning setting, actually the best! Service immaculate. We had a beautiful room at the front of the property. 6 o’clock table was perfect for dinner as the room had large windows overlooking garden where the light changed with the sunset.    High points of the meal would be a elegant aubergine soup which was not only amazing it was presented beautifully. Also beautiful was a fig with white miso dish as well as an incredible selection of appetisers.    Disappointed with eel/hamo appearing on the 11 course menu 3 times (was expecting a more luxurious fish considering the price of the meal, or at least a bit more diversity in what was served).  Dessert was shaved ice...which lacked any other flavour than super sweet green tea - actually inedible for me and my partner as it was so sweet! A disappointing note to leave the dinner on. Also very expensive for a dessert of ice..."

Kikunoi,50,"Lovely cuisine, beautiful presentation","11 course dinner served in our own dining room for 2 people. Each course presented in traditional plates/bowls and most were new to us. We loved everything except the sweetfish, which wasn't sweet but not very palatable. Good for a romantic evening out."

Kikunoi,20,Worst 3 Michelin star restaurant I know,"We love Japanese food and Kaseiki cuisine. We spent two weeks in Japan eating in several ryokans (traditional Japanese hotels) and high-end Michelin starred restaurants. We are privileged enough to have been in multiple Michelin starred restaurants across Europe and Asia.    We had booked what seemed to be the best menu available, composed of 11 Kaseiki dishes. We were instructed to arrive at 11:50 for lunch at 12:00. We arrived at 11:52, were led to a private room, typical of a traditional ryokan. It took nearly 30 minutes for the waitress to bring an English menu and to start serving our first dish.    The third dish was red sea bream sashimi which still contained many tendons (white strings). They were impossible to cut with our teeth and we couldn't swallow them given their size. When we enquired how we were supposed to eat the sashimi, we were given a series of excuses including what sounded like racist comments (e.g. we can't recognize a fresh fish properly cut as we're not Japanese.) The waitress finally looked at it and admitted that she would have removed the leftover tendon had she prepared the dish herself. We never received a simple apology nor offered an alternative to make up for it.    A few details like custom sauces were excellent. The bonito tataki was good too. The homemade wasabi ice cream was refreshing. Overall, compared to other traditional restaurants we experienced in various ryokans, the meal was average, and not even at the level of the 1-star restaurants we went to in the past.    We appreciated the advice we received about Japanese etiquette. However, we found the service pretty casual for a starred restaurant; the waitress was very chatty about her life abroad, how Japanese cuisine was so much better than any other and commented on pretty much anything and everything.    We were told that the chef was almost never at the restaurant as he was busy travelling the world, giving TV interviews and preparing menus for President Trump and Prime Minister Abe. We wondered how it was even possible for him to actually create a different menu every month given his schedule. The sous-chef finally agreed to have a quick chat with us when we asked if it was possible, which was much appreciated.    Lastly, we were both sick the entire afternoon; either the fish or the sea fruit was clearly not fresh at all. We don't understand how this restaurant was ever given any star at all."

Kikunoi,40,"Beautiful Kaiseki meal, but we were probably the wrong audience...","This meal was incredibly beautiful, and it was a very new and different experience for us. My husband and I wanted to try a traditional Kaiseki meal while we were in Kyoto, and after much research we arranged our reservations here through our hotel. The staff was incredibly attentive, although our server's English was quite limited (to be fair, our Japanese is incredibly limited), and I think that we missed out on a portion of the meal related to discussing the ingredients used in the various dishes, their preparation, and the significance of the presentation.    As for the food itself, we had the classic complaint of Westerners when it comes to Kaiseki -- the flavors are meant to be very subtle, and the fat, salt, and acid components traditionally emphasized in Western fine dining are really down-played. I knew we might feel that way, and indeed we did. Nonetheless, we loved the persimmon and the rice topped with salmon roe, and enjoyed trying yuzu and some other new flavors. I was NOT a fan of a shark fin and turtle broth soup that we were served, as I have some environmental concerns, and I wish we had known in advance that this course would be served so we could have asked to skip it.    All of the dining rooms at the restaurant are private, so it was just the two of us -- but we did have some fun people watching: a geisha was entertaining in one of the rooms and we loved watching the fleet of taxis bearing well-heeled patrons to the restaurant for this special occasion (we watched them arrive from our window).    In all, we really enjoyed our evening, but probably more for the occasion and experience than for the food. If you want to try a traditional and elegant Kaiseki meal, this is a great one, but do your research and know what to expect before you arrive."

Kikunoi,40,Reasonable price for Michelin star restaurant,Booked this restaurant through hotel staff when we have just arrived Kyoto. You can book it online but you have to prepaid it. We can’t book the bar table as we booked it last minute.    Location is easy to locate. Tasting menu price is reasonable. food is delicious with good presentation. We enjoyed our lunch here.

Kikunoi,50,Japanese haute cuisine among the Michelin stars,"N35°0.099' E135°46.925' Kyō-ryōri (Kyoto kitchen) is a style of cooking that originated from the landlocked location of Kyoto and the ancient customs of the imperial court. The dishes are prepared using fresh seasonal vegetables in an ingenious way, emphasising subtle flavours that reveal the natural taste of the ingredients. Kyō-ryōri is selected according to the mood and shades of the ever-changing seasons, and the preparation, presentation and atmosphere in which it is enjoyed are as important as the taste. Kaiseki-ryōri (Japanese haute cuisine) is the epitome of refined dining, where ingredients, preparation, setting and presentation come together to create a multi-course banquet of seasonal delicacies that is unparalleled.    Restaurant Kikunoi was extremely difficult to book in April 2018. They only accept bookings from well-known hotel reception managers. Because we did not stay in a hotel, our only option was to drive to the restaurant and request a reservation. The receptionist spoke English, accepted our request and we made a reservation in 3 days. We had to pay 49.680¥ for a multi-course dinner (yes, kaiseki-ryri is expensive) and in advance (very unusual for a restaurant).    In Kikunoi, the atmosphere of the room, where the meal is served, is just as important as the food. In April 2018, we sat on tatami, a roll decorated with calligraphy hung in the tokonoma (alcove). Before dinner the owner welcomed us with a gracious bow. She showed us a book with pictures of all the dishes on the printed menu. The server in kimono served each course with beautiful porcelain and lacquer work. Look at the menu.    The food was great, as you can expect. Beautiful textures and flavours. Delicious in every way. Perfect personal service. We smiled discreetly and were impressed by the whole experience.    For a kaiseki-ryori experience where interior design, food and service are at three-star Michelin level (and the bill of course), Kikunoi offers a unique opportunity. Highly recommended."

Kikunoi,10,Most Disappointing Meal Ever,"Had been looking forward to this meal for a very long time after seeing it featured on “The Mind of a Chef”, featuringDavid Chang (EP10 S1). On the positive side the service was mediocre and the setting was nice (own room with your own bathroom). The food was tasteless. Genuinely not a single dish came out that wowed us.    You weren’t allowed to wear perfume so as not to contaminate the smell of the food - there was none, just the musty smell of the private room.    Even the sea bream sashimi - which was one of the better dishes was like a piece of tough leather.  The turtle soup - turtle floating in tasteless broth and the eel dry and unappetising.    All in all nothing above a 5 and no ‘wow’ factor whatsoever, the only good thing was the nice sake....    Having been to many Michelin star restaurants over the years and having enjoyed many restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto, we can’t understand how this restaurant has mantained its stars."

Kikunoi,30,Disappointing service,"Had dinner here in Dec 2018. Ordered the 20,000 course. Food was good, presentation beautiful (although not as exquisite as I was expecting), but was not mind blowing. Room with garden view was beautiful but the loud noises from people talking and feet shuffling directly outside our room ruined what was supposed to be a tranquil experience.    What was most disappointing was the service. Our server spoke English well but did not provide good service and did not make us feel welcome. For instance, we had to ask for water or something to drink after the introductory tea and our glasses remained empty for long periods during the meal. Also, the dishes were not timed well. At times the next course would be brought to us before we were finished with our existing course, making us feel rushed, and at times we had very long waits between courses. It was just not a very warm experience as one would expect from a restaurant of this stature.    Overall, not a great experience due to our server and noise level."

Kikunoi,50,Exquisite Michelin experience,"Kikunoi absolutely nailed the service, ambience and taste expectations we have of a 3 Michelin star restaurant.    We had a wonderfully warm, funny and kind lady serving us the entire evening in a private room looking out to a serene, natural garden with water flowing from the mountain shrine. It was a magical scene for dinner and we kept having trouble remembering the glass panel separating the room from the garden.    The entire evening from beginning to end was meticulously detailed and beautifully executed. The combination of flavors in each course was amazingly well done, and tasted as good as it looked.    My only regret was that it was rainy and we couldn't take a picture of how beautiful the restaurant was on the exterior. However, I greatly appreciated how multiple staff members formed a mini chain of umbrellas shielding us from the pouring rain as we made a quick run for the taxi. This farewell gesture was the epitome of great service.    That said, none of this came cheap at $300 USD per person. But if you are looking for an extra special experience, I would highly recommend visiting Kikunoi."

Kikunoi,10,Overrated and disappointing,"Recommended by a friend who last visited 3 years ago. Has obviously deteriorated since. We went for the highest tier kaiseki course at 40 000¥ ( which has to be paid in full on resetvation). Quality of food was mediocre at best and repetitive in ingredients. Definitely overpriced and over rated. Would not recommend, so many other great restaurants at much lower price points. Our most disappointing meal in Kyoto. We had some rice leftover at the end of the meal and they even tried to charge us for that. 300¥ to pack our leftover rice after paying 40 000¥! So ridiculous we had to laugh."

Kikunoi,50,Amazing 3 stars Michelin restaurant,"This is the best 怀石料理 I had in Japan. Traditional and warm welcome at arriving. All dishes are delicate, extremely fresh, and amazing. Best experience and worth to go. Highly recommend."

Kikunoi,50,Amazing night to remember,Be ready spend major coin at Kikunoi. This is high-end traditional Japanese cuisine. There are a few course meal plans. The courses prepared are works of art and are delicious. Our course meal was 11 courses. You get a room all to yourself. A taxi (or car) to and from the restaurant is required. We were not told of any dress code but you should dress up. Business casual is good enough but just don’t look like a slob. Our server provided a book (in English) written by the chef to explain what we were eating.

Kikunoi,20,Poor for a 3 stars Michelin,"To be honest the menu wasn't up to our expectations. The night before, we ate at an other restaurant that had almost the same menu and was as good as at Kikunoi Honten for one third of the price. With the price we paid we were exception a menu a little bite more gourmet and special. The sashimi was so chewy that we couldn't eat it. We were expecting to see the chef but the waitress told us that he was in Tokyo (so who made the food for us?). I give a one star Michelin to that restaurant, not 3."

Kikunoi,30,Disappointed!,"We had huge Western expectations for this 3 Michelin starred Japanese restaurant and, perhaps, that was the biggest problem! Yes, the food was excellent and the service exemplary. I think we expected more art in our private room, priceless serving dishes and a more artistic presentation of the food! We also found the limited view of the tiny garden just average. Except for our own private room and our delightful server, we did not get to see very much of the rest of the restaurant, nor did we see any other guests. For Europeans, this is a very unusual dining experience! Although we were looking for something authentically Japanese, we did not feel that our experience was worth the exorbitant price!"

Kikunoi,50,Amazing experience,"Absolutely beautiful restaurant, impeccable service, uniquely delicious food.    After nice traditional Japanese welcome, we were seated in a beautiful Japanese dining room, with stunning view of a traditional garden    We had our own lovely waitress lady, who served the delicious dishes, explaining every one of them in sweet Japanese English, with the help of the Kaiseki book, written by Yoshihiro Murata, the restaurant's chef and owner.    The food, the service, the ambiance at this place are of the highest Japanese standard. Not cheap, but worth every penny !"

Kikunoi,50,Affordable Michelin 3stars kaiseki,"This is my second time to Kikunoi~as good as my first time.    This time I went with my family and the room with great view~with plants, small pond and fishes.    We had lunch there, and there were sets with different prices. We had the cheapest kaoseki~10000yen. It's good enough. There were totally 10courses and each dish was so beautiful and delicious.    A lady specially served us. Service of Kikunoi was tender.    Will definitely go for the third time."

Kikunoi,30,My first and not my last,"Well, my wife booked this and I went not truly knowing what was in stored. Over all not knowing a standard and paying for a 3 Star meal I will rate on my basic view point of services.    Entrance presentation isn't what you would think for this type of rating/restaurant. Room setting was nice and clean, fairly lighted. we ended up playing Zen music to drown out the wall noise of other servers and customers.    Our server must have been in training, tried hard and was very nervous. Senior Management came in twice to help serve and was very Professional .    Food very exotic and presentation was well planned to the seasons and dish.    I would try another location before saying not to go back.    Upon our departure we were rushed off to our taxi and in haste we all forgot about our umbrella that was in the can at door."

Kikunoi,50,Sublime cuisine and a great experience,"We ate lunch at Kikunoi and had a wonderful time.  The meal was excellent: a seasonal menu of amazing tastes and textures. This is food that hits your tastebuds in a very subtle way and takes classic themes of Japanese cuisine into a different realm.  Equally, the hospitality at Kikunoi was exceptional. We were made welcome in a friendly and relaxed way right from the greeting as we walked toward the front door until, on leaving, we turned the corner at the top of the drive, with our waitress still bowing to us at the door.    Yes, it takes a little effort to make a reservation - but it's effort that is rewarded."

Kikunoi,10,Worst experience in Japan,This is seriously the worst restaurant I have ever been to and I am quite shocked it has received any Michelin star at all. We had to choose between 2 different kaiseki menus and we took the most expensive only to be served the most disappointing and tasteless meal at an outrageously high price.

Inn at Little Washington,50,Pure luxury,The service is beyond compare and the waitstaff makes you feel you are the only one there. The food is imaginative fresh and pure. The ambiance is like dinner with royalty. It is my favourite place for celebrating your anniversary.

Inn at Little Washington,50,Memorable Dining Experience,"We had amazing dinner here to celebrate our 40 th wedding anniversary and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Service was out of this world. Food was delicious and presented with great artistic flair. It seemed like we were eating for 2 hours; but food was very light and did not weigh us down. All in all, very memorable experience"

Inn at Little Washington,50,The Ultimate Experience for a Foodie,"I do not understand the negative reviews. If you are complaining about the cost, then this is not a culinary experience for you. If you are complaining about the portions, then I do not know what to say, but I was more than full and I did not consume everything they offered to me.    My boyfriend and I booked the kitchen table for a birthday celebration. We were immediately greeted and ushered to the living room of the Inn where we enjoyed some cocktails before dinner. Then we were greeted by one of the hosts and ushered into the kitchen itself for dinner after being told that we had our table for the entire evening and should not feel rushed, but encourage to tarry and enjoy.    When we entered the kitchen there was an enjoyable exhibition of pomp and circumstance as we were personally greeted by Chef Patrick O'Connell by name and his brilliant smile. Our table was spacious and the seating comfortable. Immediately the attentive staff began to serve and accommodate us. Everyone was gracious and enjoyable. We had water immediately and personalized menus in hand as we were guided through the selections and choices before us. With those made, we began an incredible experience for any passionate foodie.    Everything from the house made bread and butter to the parmesan truffle popcorn was not only delicious, but available for unlimited refills. Restraint was necessary to avoid being overly full long before the end of the meal. We chose to get everything on the gastronaut's menu between the two of us, including the $62.00 upcharge for the caviar dish. We had ten courses, including a hand delivered first dessert course by Patrick in honor of the birthday. Every course and thus every dish was exceptional in taste and presentation. They then sent us home with a bespoke box of confections. We got more than I expected.    We also chose to do the wine pairing, and with that additional charge, I can say that one should expect to spend several thousand dollars for an all in dining experience in the chef's kitchen. What you pay for is an experience and an encounter with not just the 3 Star Michelin Chef himself, but his staff and to witness first hand the amazing fluidity of the kitchen staff. While I have never eaten in the dining room, I can say that I would without hesitation come back and dine there. This was a once in a lifetime experience to mark a special occasion for us, so the expense was well worth it to us, but if you are concerned about the fiscal bottom line or portion size, then this might now be the culinary experience for you. For us, it was one to remember forever."

Inn at Little Washington,50,"Great experience,","My meal was included with the stay at the hotel. Dinner, service and location were excellent, well deserved 3 Michelin Stars. The only issue we had was that during our arrival the person at the front desk ask for prove of the reservation. I did not have cell signal and could not show her. She made me and my wife very uncomfortable. I would expect that an hotel that is so highly regarded would have better service at their reception. After I gave her my Id and told her to check she found my reservation. She should have asked for an ID before she asked for proof of reservation. If you are white they probably won't have any issues finding your reservation.    Overall, after this small incident, everything was perfect and the stay was memorable. Breakfast at the hotel was also excellent and service during breakfast was great."

Inn at Little Washington,20,The 3-stars stood for: *Average *Overpriced *Underwhelming,"I’m giving this restaurant a 2-stars — I’ve dined at over 15 Michelin star restaurants all over the world and 3 of the 15 were 3-stars so I’d like to think that I’m pretty experienced. I really wanted to walk into this experience loving it but it was average, over priced, and underwhelming (just like I stated in my title).    Staff: Very friendly and super nice, they greeted us at the door and walked us to our table (as expected). The service at the table was a miss for me, they left crumbs on our table from the bread and it was never cleaned up, usually you’ll have people who come around and clean your crumbs. There wasn’t a stool or a basket where you can put your purse or belongings in, usually they have that at the the table. The sommelier wasn’t certified but he was the sweetest kid! I could tell he was still in training due to his lack of knowledge of pairing the wine with the food, and I also learned that he tried deconstructed dishes that are usually left overs to help him pair the wine which I find very interesting because if you want consistency throughout the experience, every sommelier should be treated the same. I understand that he’s in training but why wouldn’t you have a certified sommelier around to assist him. The condensation from the wine dripped over my fiancé bread as it was being poured, I’m used a clean bottle. Overall the staff was nice and knowledgeable.    Food: The food was so good but it wasn’t great. We picked the Gastronomy menu with the wine pairing. I found it odd that with the menu you still had to pick this or that, I’m used to enjoying everything on the menu as is but if we still need to pick between appetizers, main course, and dessert let’s not call it a tasting menu. The food was cooked and well prepared but the plating was boring and subpar, there was no theme to the menu it was just food on a white plate. None of the dishes wowed me it was just good. The wine paired well with the food but we didn’t get the background of what notes to taste for or look forward to, I didn’t enjoy the 4 empty glasses placed on the table for future wine to come, it over crowded our table and it made it a little complicating for our server to serve us food as things had to be moved around — not the type of service you would expect from a 3-star.    Parking: Plenty of parking and valet available.  Ambiance: Beautiful seating area and nice colonial feel.  Vegetarian and’s vegan options available.    Overall Summary: In short, you don’t get what you pay for. I suggest you save up the $2K you’re about to spend on this experience and purchase a plane ticket overseas and pay for a 3-star in Spain or France."

Inn at Little Washington,30,"Michelin, what’s the grading criteria? How is this rated your highest grade?","This restaurant is good but overhyped. I think Michelin gives this one a “pass” due to the uniqueness of its location, the history and frankly it needs to be re-rated because it does not meet the standard of a Michelin 3 star like Aponiente in Spain. I had high expectations due to how everyone in the town speaks so highly of this place. It honestly feels a little weird because it’s as if everyone is afraid to speak truthfully on the restaurant out of fear they’ll disappear like in a horror movie, kind of cultish vibes. If this is your first Michelin I get why you’d love this place but they have some work to do.    Anyway, out of all of the Michelin restaurants I’ve been to, the service, the presentation and the food all was top notch and was like a dance. The Inn at Little Washington seemed like they were resting on the fact that they were a top rated restaurant and didn’t need to work as hard. For a restaurant that I spent nearly $1,600 for I expected a lot.    I didn’t like that I had to pick between menus. Since I paid for a tasting menu with a wine pairing I expected the restaurant to provide several courses that would fill me up and I was not anywhere near full at the conclusion of dinner. The plating and presentation of the food was boring, there was no style or awe factor in how the food was presented. Most places will try to match the cuisine to a creative plate. It was pretty underwhelming. The Michelin company rated The Inn to have a gastronomy star yet the restaurant didn’t explain what specifically about their menu was gastronomy like others that I’ve been too.    The sommelier we had wasn’t certified and didn’t have his grape pin. Typically Michelin restaurants who have a sommelier in training will have an actual sommelier with them throughout the dining experience. With our wine pairing they placed several empty glasses on the table which I had never seen before and didn’t fill them, typically your wine glasses aren’t just sitting on the table taking up space from your plates. Generally each glass is brought to you for each course. They didn’t take the time to wipe off the bottles after they pulled it from the wine cooler, as the sommelier in training poured, there was lots of ice water from the bottle dripping on our table and food.    The waiters didn’t remove bread crumbs from our table, didn’t fold our napkins when we went to the restroom, didn’t have a stool or basket for us to put our belongings in at our table. Nothing during the fine dining screamed three star restaurant, I think Michelin needs to re-evaluate this, I believe this place is a ONE star at best. Overseas Michelin’s seem to have to go through a higher grading criteria because I’ve seen way better places that are underrated that could be two or three stars and the Inn is somehow rated higher with not nearly as good of service.    Typically if the chef is not on travel they will come out and greet their guest and Mr. O’Connell didn’t seem to have the time I presume to stop by tables to simply say hello. I truly expected more but you know what they say about high expectations leading to high disappointment. It’s just not worth the money spent."

Inn at Little Washington,30,Even 3 Star Michelin Restaurants have bad nights.,"Not our first visit, but certainly our least enjoyable. Our only expectation was that the experience would justify the $2800 we paid for a party of 4. I feel strongly that objectively it missed the mark.  I will repeat what others reviewers have already stated. My very first cocktail was incorrect. The food service timing was oddly off. A table close to us was seated after we were and was on their 3rd course before our appetizers arrived. The bread service was inconsistent and as many have pointed out the breadcrumbs on our table were only removed prior to our desert. Quarters were cramped, forcing servers to reach over the table. Multiple times during the meal objects were dropped close by startling all of us. Overall the service was good but not delivered with ease and the engagements felt rehearsed. The star of the evening was our sommelier. Her knowledge and explanations of our wine pairings were both insightful and entertaining. At the end of our meal we were not offered after dinner drinks or coffee/tea service. We end up retiring to the bar area for drinks, where the disappointment continued and we waited 15 minutes for someone to recognize we were done so we could pay our check. I ended up paying cash for the drinks so we could leave without any further hurdles.  It’s unfortunate and I don’t think we’ll be back."

Inn at Little Washington,50,What an experience!,"This dinner lived up to every expectation. What a great night! The food was out of this world. I don’t think I can pick a favorite. My husband and I celebrated our 35th anniversary here. Cameron the cheese whiz entertained us but also put together a terrific cheese selection for us.    The inn sent us home with some very tasty treats as well. Will do this again for sure.    Also, seeing the kitchen in action from the window was spectacular."

Inn at Little Washington,50,Foodies,"This restaurant definately deserve *** Michilin Star. The course, the wine, the atmosphere is to the core. I would love to be back again"

Inn at Little Washington,50,A dining experience like no other!,"Superlatives are no exaggeration in writing about the Inn at Little Washington. Our experience was splendid, delightful, and outstanding in every way. The staff is superbly trained, polite and pleasant to a fault and very personable. They were attentive to every need and also knew when to be unobtrusive allowing us to enjoy our food and each other's company undisturbed. Courses were timed perfectly- we never felt rushed, nor did we feel we waited too long between courses. As to the food, Chef Patrick O'Connell has to be considered one of the very best in the world. This is not hyperbole. The textures and tastes of each course were delectable and the presentation and appearance were artistic and enticing. The photos enclosed here will give you an idea. We were lucky to be served in the sunny, cheerful conservatory overlooking the gardens. What a treat- a beautiful, relaxing setting ideal for enjoying our dinners. As an added bonus, we were given a box (in the shape and likeness of the Inn) of sweets and, much to our surprise, the prepaid reservation included the gratuity so we were told everything was already covered. Valet parking was also complimentary but still we wanted to give our valet a tip. And to top it all off, the background music was much to our liking as well. They even provided a list of all the music to take home with us along with menus that were personally marked with the names of our birthday celebrants. What more could you ask? In sum, experiencing the Inn and its remarkably inventive and mouth-watering cuisine is a must!"

Inn at Little Washington,50,Magical,"A team of staff will take care of you, but Mason was the main waiter and did a good job. My husband had the Gastronaut menu and I had the Good Earth menu. Every single course on both menus was outstanding. Even the Amuse-Bouche before the start were to die for. We also got the wine pairings and they all were perfect except for the sake which was just a little off. A minor thing in the overall experience! The piece de resistance was the cheese course. Definitely worth the $30 up charge. Cameron brings the mooing cow cart to the table with a vast choice of cheeses on the tray. You get to pick five. He is an absolute riot! He has a cheese or cow joke for every comment. We did not leave hungry - the portions are just right. Could they have been bigger? Sure - but that’s only because everything was so delicious I could have eaten more but then it would have been too much and my guts would have been stuffed and uncomfortable. I left feeling quite comfortable. The Inn at Little Washington is a very special treat for sure."

Inn at Little Washington,30,Good…but not worth the trip or 3 stars,"The food and preparation and outstanding. This was my third and last visit to Inn at Little Washington. Our lead waiter, Will, was inexperienced. He didn’t know the drink menu, told us they didn’t have a drink they did, brought me the wrong drink which I had to send back. This was a one-star experience at best.    At the end of the meal, we asked for a souvenir from the table, and our lovely 2nd in command Anja said we could take flowers after checking with her boss. Will stopped us in the lobby and made a scene that we needed to return the flowers or pay for them. It was embarrassing and poor judgement. He overrode his own team and stained the evening. If you are in the DC area, skip the Inn, save the money and the trip and go to the many Michelin star restaurants (Oyster oyster, Cranes) for a better overall experience. If you do go, do yourself a favor and try to avoid Will’s table."

Inn at Little Washington,50,Great dining experience,"The Inn at Little Washington was a wonderful way to treat myself to a lovely dining experience. As a solo diner, I was treated very well.    Service was exceptional and everyone very knowledgeable and friendly. My sommelier explained all the wine pairings very well and had great wine knowledge.    The food was innovative, presently with whimsical touches. Everything was delicious. The cow cheese cart was also a bit of whimsy that I loved. The man who oversaw the cheese cart was very helpful.    At the end of my meal, I was given a tour of the kitchen by none other than Patrick O'Connell, the sole proprietor and chef. He was very gracious.    I did not stay at the Inn itself but loved wandering and seeing the lovely grounds which the Inn owns, including the chicken coop, apiary, herb/vegtable garden and the sheep and goats.    I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Inn at Little Washington."

Inn at Little Washington,50,Amazing Birthday Celebratio!,An amazing birthday celebration at the kitchen table. This is far more than a 3-star Michelin experience!

Inn at Little Washington,50,A Wonderful Dining Experience in a Beautiful Setting,"The Inn at Little Washington deserves its reputation as one of a few great restaurants in the US where dining is more than enjoying a very fine meal. I used the word “Experience” on purpose. The setting is very charming. When entering the restaurant, one thinks they have been invited to dinner at an ante-bellum home. Indeed, you will be greeted as a guest--not a customer.    The food was excellent. There were two menus the night we dined. One was vegetarian. Although you are to select one, we were able to “mix and match”. My wife had the standard menu for the evening. Following an amuse-bouche, she started with carpaccio of tuna and swordfish with avocado and wasabi. This was followed by a Carolina shrimp tartlet with spring peas and Virginia country ham, and then by a chartreuse of Savoy cabbage and Maine lobster with caviar beurre blanc. For her main dish, she selected the pepper-crusted Long Island Duck Breast with Cara Cara oranges and turnip puree. For dessert, a coconut - passionfruit angel food cake.    I followed her lead except that I selected the ""Moussaka"" with layers of braised eggplant, roasted potatoes and creamy mornay as my main dish from the vegetarian menu. It was fine, but I should have followed her lead here too. I had a selection of cheese for dessert from a very fine cheese cart (in the shape of a cow--not too serious, as I said).    Understanding the price is important to avoid disappointment. Dinners are prix fix at about $350. If you add a cocktail, a shared bottle of very reasonably priced wine, and tip, you come to about $500 per head. For most, it is the venue for a special occasion.    For many years the Inn and the French Laundry in Napa were “the two” most widely regarded restaurants in the US. The American restaurant scene has improved dramatically over the years, but the Inn is still a memorable dining experience."

Inn at Little Washington,10,Very over priced.,"Ouch - we just paid $813. dinner for 2. Had 1 glass of wine and 1 vodka/tonic. We were there 20 years ago & did not pay this. No dinner is worth that much money. We were told the room would be $1,000 but no. It was $1445. Needless to say we will not be back!!!"

Inn at Little Washington,50,Perfect,We had an absolutely perfect dinner. The service was flawless. Each course was gorgeous and delicious. The highlight was the cheese course served on a mooing cow. I highly recommend dining here for a very special occasion.

Inn at Little Washington,40,"Good, but not 3 stars and too expensive","To begin with, the service was hit or miss. The waiter could not answer any questions about the menu or the wine. There was no consistent presence, a large group was working together and thus it felt rather impersonal. And given how many people were involved, it was surprisingly not attentive enough, missing opportunities to check on us. Later in the meal our waiter changed and the new one was better. Still, not something you expect from a 3-star Michelin.    The food was generally excellently prepared, but lacked the inventiveness one would expect from a 3-star Michelin. OK, I got a perfectly prepared medium-rare piece of lamb with some herby crust, but it's just a piece of lamb. If you are a traditionalist and really enjoy old classics with a bit of a twist, then this place is for you. When I pay 1K for dinner, I expect something to tickle my senses. From the whole dinner I can only remember wasabi sorbet served with carpaccio that was unusual and inventive.    To me this was a very good dinner, but it should have cost about half as much as we paid. So, we enjoyed it, but will not come back. DC these days has a lot of Michelin restaurants that give more for less money."

Inn at Little Washington,50,Romantic getaway complete with pampering!,From our welcome cocktail to the tea to the perfectly prepared cocktails to the divine dinner with attentive staff tending to your every request you feel pampered. The experience is all that o e could request and more. The spaces are perfectly appointed. The food was outrageously delicious and presented. No details overlooked.

Inn at Little Washington,50,STELLAR. EVERY SINGLE DETAIL!,"We honestly didn't know what to expect and we arrived just after dark to a charming ""town"" that consists of only a couple blocks. The quaint little Inn was lit up with string lights and we were greeted by the valet who greeted us by name. They swept our bags out of our car and when the concierge brought us to our room, our bags were already there. Every single detail of this place was clearly thought out and the staff was fully aware that the magic IS in the details. As we were awe-struck by our beautiful room, Katie came knocking with 2 glasses of champagne. Our room has surround sound, really really cute cozy decor and a porch we wanted to enjoy but it was 12 degrees outside!    We dressed up a little to go downstairs for our dinner reservation and the attention to service was really touching. They have their staff trained to treat each guest as if they ARE the guest of honor.    Each of our servers brought amazing service but also their own unique personalities and stories and humor. Dinner was extravagant. The restaurant is a masterpiece of chef Patrick O'Connell. He has put his entire life's work into this, immaculate conception to delivery. His story and the experience can teach a person a lot about life, hard work, dreaming big, serving others and focus. The experience will stick with us for a long time to come."

Inn at Little Washington,20,Who awarded this place 3 Stars??,"As local Virginians, Inn has been on our hit list for years. What a disappointing night it turned out to be.  First off, leaving a 3 Michelin-star restaurant not full is a sin. Thank goodness for the unlimited bread service or I would have left and had to stop somewhere for a follow-up meal.  First up is the food. Nothing is bad, but also nothing is over the top amazing in taste, visuals, or quantity provided. Half the dishes were gastronomic experience size..except there aren't enough courses for that. The rabbit dish was VERY dry.  What was most disappointing was the service. At 3 Michelin stars, you expect the best of the best. Our server, Katelyn, lacked sophistication. As did several other of the younger servers. Was this their first day? Katelyn asked us what we wanted to drink as soon as she approached the table. How about giving us a drink menu first? After she took our food orders, she forgot to ask again what we wanted to drink - we had to tell her. I had to ask for more bread - 3x. When I mentioned the duck being dry to Katelyn, her response was ""oh I'm sorry about that, I hope the sauce makes up for it."" Unbelievable. Also heard her forget to ask the table next to us what dessert they wanted and had to go back. One of the servers who delivered two of our courses reached OVER the table to set mine down, and his arms shook wildly both times. So much so, that the content of my plate moved both times - he never fixed it. The service was beyond elementary for a fine dining establishment that has no stars, let alone one with ""3"".  For the hour+ drive, cost, and overall extremely disappointing experience, we will not be back, and will not recommend it to anyone who asks."

Inn at Little Washington,50,Excellent evening at the Inn,"This is my 2nd 3-Michelin star restaurant and untold numbers of 1-Michelin starred restaurants. Overall, I found the service, atmosphere, food to be excellent.    First, the atmosphere: very warm and southern. It gave me a comfortable feel which I liked. It's funny because usually I go for a more modern aesthetic, but I actually really loved the atmosphere here. Walking in the door, the fresh flower gave a beautiful scent. The crackling fireplace made it warm and cozy. Lots to look at with a busy, yet still cozy dinner setting. There are several rooms from what I could tell, but we were not far from the fireplace so that was lovely for us.    The service was great. They kept the pace based on our clues. When I had to use the restroom, the pacing slowed to accommodate my return. The tables were a tad close together, but nothing bad.    The food was great. I'm getting tired of going to fancy restaurants where they give us multiple amuse bouche(s) and they're large and it ends up we are full before the first course arrives. The Inn did the amuse bouche correctly - just a proper starter and a single one at that.    On top of that, we loved real bread. One restaurant I went to brought us a puffy bread that was just air inside (like a balloon with a bread crust). Ugh. So I loved the Inn's bread offering.    Outside of that, the dinner and wine pairings were delicious.    We'd love to return."

Inn at Little Washington,20,Avoid!,"This is a 3-Star Michelin restaurant. We do not know why. They play outdated pop-country music. The entire time you are trying to enjoy world class food, you have to listen to Brad Paisley sing about getting mud on his tires and Brooks and Dunn sing their 90’s hit Neon Moonlight.    Furthermore asking them to change the music prompted the response, “Perhaps you’d prefer to be served in your room.”    The dinner alone, after tax, drinks, and service will run close to a $1000. It is absolutely insane to pay this for the type of experience here.    Lastly, the room we stayed in was beautiful until we discovered what looks like human feces on the shower floor.    Avoid!!"

Inn at Little Washington,50,Continues to surpass our expectations with each visit!,"This was our 4th visit to the Inn at Little Washington. Each time, we think, it can't be better than the last...but it is! Somehow, they marry tradition and evolution beautifully. The things we love about the inn remain, yet lovely new touches surprise us each visit. This time, we enjoyed lunch at the new Patty O's which was cozy and relaxing on a cold fall day. Our dinner at the Inn was phenomenal every step of the way and the service impeccable. As others have said, don't miss the fun of Cameron and the cheese course. Chef Patrick was in on this visit, and he was a gracious and wonderful host, moving about the lounge talking to guests. We stopped at the bakery as we left and the team there is just as charming as the rest. We can't wait to return!"

Inn at Little Washington,50,Two Great Meals!,"Dined here twice during a two-night stay in July. Both meals were incredible (even though I miss some prior dishes, such as the popcorn amuse bouche and the seven deadly sins dessert). The Inn changed both menus for us (1 vegetarian + 3 regular menus) the second night to avoid a repeat of the first night and even sampled a couple of additional dishes. The service was impeccable, of course, and the entire experience remains well-worth the splurge. (Also, apart from dinner, the house breakfast is great, and the inclusion of breakfast and afternoon tea with the room rate is actually a remarkable deal considering the quality.)"

Inn at Little Washington,50,AMAZING! Thank you,"Spent our 30th anniversary here and just a simple WOW! Over the top cuisine, service and warmly welcomed in our suite for the weekend. Definitely put on your bucket list and you will not regret it. Thank you DH for this wonderful surprise. I am not big on posting online, but this was worth it."

Inn at Little Washington,50,Fabulous Dinner,"Celebrated a big birthday with dinner at the Inn and it was perfect in every way. Esp loved the lamb/Caesar salad dish and the duck breast with fig (OMG so good!), but Cameron and his cheeses stole the show! Highly recommend for anyone who loves a spectacular tasting menu!"

DiverXO,50,One of the best meals I had in spain,"Perfect junction of creative, presentation, and taste. It's obvious why this has 3 michelin stars and is rated 3rd best restaurant in the world for 2023. The food and service was top notch and I would happily come back and experience it again."

DiverXO,50,SO Worth the Hype! The meal is the Special Journey!!,"Chef David Muñoz is theatrical, intense, and supremely talented…and it shows in his signature 3* Michelin restaurant DiverXO.    The setting, the service staffs’ clothing, and some of the culinary presentations are whimsical takes on Alice in Wonderland. And although there are crazy flying pigs everywhere (and the Chef’s image), the whimsy stops there. The service staff is professional, friendly, attentive and helpful. The food is creative, fresh, flavorful, intense, unique and above all tasty. The wine pairing worked SO well with food that they work to create an integrated and RARE culinary experience.    Suffice it to say that I left a contented customer who’d return for round 2 if given a chance."

DiverXO,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"More of an experience than a simple meal. Everything about it is well thought of and considered, food exceptional as was the venue and service. A once in a lifetime experience."

DiverXO,50,Not your average dining experience,"Those that have the privilege of dining at this restaurant should consider themselves extremely lucky. This is amongst the most unique dining experiences you will ever have (in a good way). The cuisine of flying pigs will take you on a journey that you will not be prepared for in any way. Not only will it showcase seasonal produce coming from specific regions in Spain, but other culinary treasures across the world (mostly Asia). The best food I have had in a very long time and I doubt I will be able to find something to top this. In addition to the food, the service is outstanding and not too pushy on alcohol."

DiverXO,40,More of an EXPERIENCE than a MEAL,"I found myself in Spain during family vacation with the grand finale being a fantastic dinner at this well renowned Michelin star restaurant and let me tell you, it has three starts for a reason. The atmosphere itself is astonishing and creates a unique backdrop unlike any other. The origin of the chef will explain all the winged pigs. Our reservation was at 7:30 so of course we arrived at 7:20 and was greeted with the kindest hostess. She led us to our table where they pull the chairs out for you and gently push you in. We started our experience with the Krug 171 edition champagne. Delicious on its own. We then had our waiter assigned to our table and he introduced himself and gave us a brief summary of what we shall expect and for us, it was a 14-18 course tasting menu that brings you al around Espana. Each dish has its own unique identity and is more of a piece of art than a meal. The waiter always explains what to expect before eating and how to go about it to get the most flavor possible(for example, eat this part first and then mix it up for the full effect). This was a long meal, 3 hours, but the time flew by as they constantly bring out new dishes and elaborate on its creation. I would definitely stop here if you are one who enjoys a more avant-garde approach to fine dining. Would I say its worth the price? Yes I would say so. Like I said, its an experience not a meal so you will find yourself talking about it to friends and family for years to come.    TLDR: Not a meal but a culinary adventure with an amazing atmosphere and staff. Unlike any other restaurant out there and if you have the time and resources, stop by."

DiverXO,50,Exploding dumplings!,"What a terrific experience. perhaps the best dining experience I’ve had so far. The website does not prepare you for how lovely and elegant the interior is. The website presents itself so hard-edged, almost punk but the restaurant is not this way. having said that it is not a stuffy restaurant. Everyone was very friendly. Shoutout to Miguel our primary server who was charming and polite. Also the Somme whose name I unfortunately did not catch. It is a lot of food and wine and clear your whole day. The four of us spent 5.5 hours there. The pace is surprisingly crisp so that is an indication of just how much they serve over small items. It was truly an adventure. Especially the exploding dumpling. Prepare to have a great time! You may need a siesta after."

DiverXO,50,Will be back again,"Excellent restaurant from the ambience, service,and even special late requests like accommodating my wife who doesn't like shell fish. Every detail is considered here and most importantly the food tasted great. Definitely lived up to the hype and deserves the 3 stars and place on the 50 best list"

DiverXO,50,One of the best meals of my life.,"I start writing this report as we have just finished the second course of the menu, and I can’t find words to describe how blown away I am. Words like « best meal I have had in my life » come to mind. I start comparing to the feelings I had in El Bulli, at Noma, at Mazzia, at Arpège, the first time I went…    There were lots of emotions in this meal. The place, the complexity of the food, the flavours, the power, the amazing taste. I must say I am utterly impressed. And that’s not easy to do !!! 🤣 So much variety, elements, spices, surprises in just two courses. Wow.    Let’s go back to the beginning now.    The restaurant is located in a small gallery next to the NH hotel. From the outside it looks like an Asian restaurant, with white curtains around a revolving door. Inside, hostesses dressed in very formal embroided suits welcome you with a big smile. Yes restaurants is up one flight of stairs covered with velvet like fabric. Everywhere, paintings and statues of funny pigs with punk accessories.    We are offered two wine pairings at 300€/p and 600€/p which we kindly declined. We order two nice glasses of two different sake, two glasses of Godello and a bottle of Albariño. For a start ! We had some more glasses later but I must say I didn’t connect with the sommelier, an older, quite classical man, who apparently does not care much about natural wines. Too bad as it would go great with this cuisine. Oh well. What we chose to drink was fine.    No « mises en bouche » and no bread. Straight to business.  The first course was already a shock. This is the description : TUNA MARROW AND LITTLE OCTOPUS FROM LA COSTA BRAVA ;  ""MARMITAKO"" WITH YELLOW TOMATOES, CALAMANSI AND AJI MIRASOL ; ""TORTIYAKI QUE FALA GALEGO"" BETANZOS STYLE WITH BABY OCTOPUS SCALES AS IF THEY WERE POTATOES AND O-TORO SASHIMI WITH CHERRY TOMATO REDUCTION.    😳. Hello ? Yes, that’s only the description of the FIRST course !  So you will understand I won’t be able to list them all in this text, but, HOW practical, they bring you a document describing EACH dish before they serve it.    So that first course was totally amazing. The soup made of tuna marrow was served in an object looking like a tuna vertebre that I believe was created with a 3D printer. It tasted and looked amazing. The baby octopus in it too, the sort of kroepoek on top also. The little bun with the tuna belly was to die for.    The second course totalled blew me away. Spinach, spinach root, some special peasant soup that was incredible, a piece of lamb to use as CONDIMENT (!!), and a dozen of other elements to make a stunning plate, filled with spices, flavours, textures, as they call the dish an »rollercoaster » for the eye, nose and mouth. One of the best plates I’ve had in my life.    After that, the festival went on and on. I can’t go in detail on every course. Pigeon « cooked » for ten days in COLD wine (melting in your mouth) !! Crayfish with truffled on a 45 days aged Pyrenean trout ! Ice Cold powders sprinkled on hot flesh. Meat at the beginning, fish at the end. Lobster head in vindaloo sauce, claws in a beignet on top of a 1m high elephant statue ! Explosive cuttlefish spoon ! Deconstructed stew ; Wagyu Beef broth to drink from a horn ; truffle risotto as a dessert… etc etc. All the culinary principles were challenged, and all for the best.    The restaurant is separated in about 20 little round alcoves made of curtain surrounding round or square tables for 2 to 4 guests each. Service is very friendly, precise, fast. Even the toilets are an experience !    So DiverXO is clearly one of the best meals I have had in my life. Top 5, probably top 3, I will decide when I have digested all this in about three weeks. It was amazing. Again : Wow."

DiverXO,50,Unforgettable experience,"The food was delicious, creative and stood apart from the other 3-stars restaurants that we have tried. The menu consisted of mostly seafood which I love. I really appreciated the food descriptions they gave prior to serving you the next course. It was definitely a splurge but so worth it!"

DiverXO,50,Worth all the fanfare ! A must go guys … and don’t plan anything after the meal !,"Michelin guide: 3 Michelin stars - exceptional cuisine, with a special journey. Brainchild of head chef Dabiz Muñoz, DiverXo will bring you along for an unforgettable ride through Asia. Being Asian, the expectation for Asian dishes is high and he exceeded by most counts using great ingredients, showcasing extreme innovation, and procuring mind boggling flavours. The flavours are milder than some Asian dishes like those for Laksa and Green Curry but the concoction still came out delicious. Save four hours for the meal and don’t eat beforehand whatsoever, and you won’t regret coming here. Great service and explanation of each course! We were in Madrid for three days and eating here was the best thing we did in Madrid !"

DiverXO,50,The pigs they flew!,"I will be honest, there is no way for me to describe the creativity of this experience and the range of sensations i experienced throughout this 5 hours journey. I will resume it in few words, creativity, genius, skills, expertise, research, passion and a gastronomical spectacle.  The service is totally impeccable. Attentive and warm. The wine pairing was incredible, it comes with a price, but you will taste wines that you’ll probably never taste in your life.  As an anecdote, the chef read my i Instagram message and invited us in the kitchen to discuss and take some pictures, which was super nice.  You know the expression when pigs fly…..well they flew"

DiverXO,10,Won't remember...,"My family of 4 had dinner at DiverXO this evening. It's not everyday that a family of 4 spends approx $2000 (dinner+drinks+tip) on dinner. So when our 13yr/10yr old asked to meet the chef, we were told by our server that she will speak to him. My husband and I indicated that we did not need to meet David, but it would be nice for the kids since they researched his restaurant and sat through his 4.5hr meal.    Maybe I thought David Munoz would be like Grant Achatz (Alinea), Eduard Xatruch (Disfrutar) and other noteworthy chefs and exhibit a little bit of humility to meet with his youngest patrons. After all, one server commented that having kids in DiverXO is very “uncommon.”    But I was wrong. Even after I saw David through a small window on the kitchen door (with is faded red mohawk), our server avoided bringing it up. When I probed again, our server made up an excuse that he had left the building. It started to get comical when I asked server #2 and he made a different excuse as to why he couldn’t come out. And to top it off, a manager who saw what was going on, but avoided us as we left.    “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did , but people will never forget how you made them feel.” I won’t remember the food. I won’t remember the décor. I will remember spending $2000 with a classless, egotistical mohawk man."

DiverXO,50,Food was to die for,"I understand that David Munoz wants to be the best in the world.  After our visit to DiverXO he already is when it comes to food.  Ingredients and presentation were out of this world.  I have never had so many perfect dishes in one meal.  Rating for the food here is more than 5.  The service was too arrogant for my taste, so less than 5.  The interior was disappointing, so less than 5.  But since the food was so amazing it is an overall top rating from me."

DiverXO,50,It meant to wow and wow indeed,"It is an experience that you would remember for a long long time. Put all your regular 3 star expectations aside and enjoy the crazy almost 4 hour ride. There are a lot of interesting ingredients (baby eels, a whole pigeon leg with claws etc.) with very little flexibility in the menu. You have to be adventurous with your food to truly enjoy and appreciate this place. Aside from the food, the wine pairing is a whole beautiful journey on its own. The higher end option of the wine pairing will set you back 300 euros alone, but you are never going to forget how delicious each and every wine is, paired or on its own. The best wine pairing I've ever had."

DiverXO,50,Amazing !,"We had the chance to do a lot of 3 stars Michelin and this one is one of the top such different !  First of all the area with butterfly, pigs and curtains for each table - this is not usual and so nice ! Staff is dressed like in Asia and not in standard Michelin restaurant !  Secondly the menu is for all the people the same and a total surprise. It is so surprising and not commun but so much flavor in each plate ! The most difficult thing is to have a have table price is expensive (365 pp with no drink) but it really worth it due to the concept and the food itself with high price piece ! The only small negative point David Munoz was there and didn’t show in the clients table - otherwise to be visited absolutely ! Check the pictures !!!"

DiverXO,50,When only the very best will satisfy,From the moment you walk in the door you know you are in for something very special. Expertly prepared dishes presented in surprising innovative ways. Nine magical courses. Wine service was absolutely amazing. Sommelier was truly enthusiastic about each carefully selected wine. This is our fifth 3 star and I rate it as best. Finesse to the absolute extreme. Wonderful and memorable experience.

DiverXO,50,An awe-inspiring meal,"With the rise of Instagram, the idea of food as ""art"" is more prominent than ever, but for those fortune enough to visit some of the world's top tables the difference between #yolkporn or a #cheesepull and truly inventive cuisine is obvious. At DiverXO, Chef Dabiz Muñoz goes one step further, turning dinner into a performance complete with ""set"" changes, themes, a costumed staff and dialogue - there is even a complete playbill that arrives as cards preceding each course.    Currently Madrid’s only Michelin 3* Restaurant, its location inside NH Collection seeing a revolving door give way to “the hedonistic, greedy and creative world” of its Chef, diners fortunate enough to secure a reservation will be taken on a journey during which precedent is cast aside in favor of fantasy and flawless service.    €250 for the Tasting menu, Asian influence and exotic Ingredients abound, it is after passing by flying Pigs, Ants, Butterflies and more that diners find themselves divided by varying cloths such that each dish or “canvas” is a surprise unto itself.    Undersold by describing each dish individually, the first six items embracing Muñoz’s love of Thai Street Food, one will quickly realize that despite DiverXO’s styling the bulk of its cookery relies on grills, stoves and fire rather than molecular or modernist technique.    Changing the menu with far more frequency than many of the W50B, in a way that suggests unbridled creativity, “course” two uses Yakitori Fish as Condiments to a Salad inspired by lost product while “Crunchy Texture Ceviche” offers snappy Baby Eels in complex heat prior to a one-bite XLB filled by Cuttlefish, Pork and Chili Paste.    Relying on surprise with Fried Eggs and Black Pudding, its second half revealed with similar flavor but alternate texture, “Sea Noodles” resemble something emerging from the depths before a supple Pigeon Leg tenderized by Wine alongside Noodles made of Gelatin with Eggs of Hen and Sturgeon.    Undoubtedly inspired by Dali, and wearing that fact on his sleeve with “Galician Lobster Waking up on the Beaches of Goa,” Muñoz unveils a masterpiece in three Indian ideas complete with an elongated Elephant before continuing with Grilled Monkfish and vibrant green Gazpacho.    Next showing off A5 Kagoshima Wagyu, before serving it sucked from a Bone, there is little surprise when Rabbit Brains arrive as a palate cleanser preceding buttered Risotto and a White Chocolate Orb with Black Olives, Truffles and Rhubarb.    Suggesting “avant-garde cuisine in which everything is possible,” including Black Currant Bubblegum that somehow makes Garlic for Dessert work, Japanese Bombons come atop motorized Mad Hatter’s hats to complete an experience that truly reinvents the idea of “exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey."""

DiverXO,50,Dreaming about returning,"We had a chance to visit David Munoz’s flagship restaurant in Madrid December 2019.  The extravagant 40 years old chef develops 35-40 new dishes every year. His very unique cooking style with his extraordinary creativity results a perfect dining experience. He is bravely mixing Mediterranean, Asian and South American ingredients into art on the plate.  The dining room is a reflection of his extravagant style. Fancy decor with pink colour dominations, lot of curtains and theatrical elements like flying pigs all over.  After the welcome drinks ( Grosset Grand Rose champagne with pink label) the meal started with canopes.  The cantonese chicken, the sheep's milk and maturated salmon croquette and the taco was a very impressive warming up, all were delicious with plenty of flavour.  This was followed by some Indian dishes. A very deep flavour vindaloo curry was balanced with greek yoghurt, Dal Makhani & Frog leg prepared like buttered chicken masala, with papadum of lentils. Pan puri filled with New Delhi salmorejo and Joselito's coppa. Very special steamed, light and fluffy naan with truffle and Mumbai flower with pink pepper. The spices were beautifully balanced in all Indian dishes.  Than we went to China. Roman style kokotxa was served together with Necora chilli crab and it was followed by one of the most successful dish of the meal, Xialongbao Xo Iberian soup dumpling with aged beef rib & bone marrow. All the elements were precisely flavoured and cooked.  And many, more and more beautiful dishes. Red mullet and smoked eel, The sea urchin we had to eat from our hand. That was followed by and another great dish, suckling pig skin with squids, matured tomatoes, Habanero puree. Idiazabal cheese, frozen green lemon and coriander root. The suckling pig skin was crispy and light, the light sweetness of the matured tomato was in perfect balance with the savoury of the cheese, the sourness of green lemon with coriander and the creamy Habanero pure. This was a terrific dish.  Red mullet with Moroccan lemon, smoked chorizo juice and Olluco puree. A lovely dish with rich flavour was carefully balanced. Kagoshima wagyu fillet steak. A high quality, A5 grade , perfectly marbled, very high quality Kobe beef cooked to perfection.  His 25 courses menu was a fantastic gastronomic journey around the world.  With this wonderful diner we had a wonderful wine, one of my favourite Spanish white wines, a bottle of As Sortes from Rafael palacios’s winery. The presentation was extraordinary, the service was top level, smooth and friendly all the way through the 3,5 hours dining time.  I am sure this was not our last visit to this fabulous place."

DiverXO,50,"True Creativity, Amazing Taste, Masterfully Delivered",The restaurant encompasses all of the senses. From the moment you arrive to the point of final submission you have been thorouhly stimulated and satiated. Upon arival to the restaurant all of the visual cues let you know something very creative and special is about to happen. There are no dissapointments. Truly a very special culinary experience.

DiverXO,50,From Milano to Madrid,"We first saw Chef Muñoz during the Masterchef Italia competition (aired in 2019), where contestants had to work at his restaurant in Madrid, DiverXO. We came from Milano to dine at DiverXO in January 2020.  A culinary experience out of this world.  Prepare yourselves, go to DiverXO with an open mind and you will for sure appreciate the Chef’s tasting menu. The different courses have the taste of European, Peruvian, Japanese, Indian, Korean, etc… A tour all around the world, just by sitting at the table in this extraordinary restaurant.  Upon reservation, we asked for an Italian-speaking waitress/waiter, in order to better understand the explanation for each dish. We were assigned an Italian waitress who guided us through this experience and was very helpful, nice and professional during our 18 courses tasting menu.  How to explain the experience at DiverXO? One of a kind.  Everything was perfect, form the visit to the wine cellar, to the room kept at 16°C dedicated to the handling of raw ingredients and desserts, to the actual kitchen, with an astonishing number of professionals of the Chef’s team.  Like art in a museum, whoever can understand this kind of culinary philosophy will surely remain full of marvel and the dishes are surely incredible, almost moving. All the senses are satisfied during this experience.  Thanks again to Chef David Muñoz for taking the time to leave his place in the kitchen to take a picture with us.  Just one thing to underline: the wine list is surely well equipped, pages and pages of different wines form all over the world, however we found just one red wine and just one white wine from Italy. That’s a bit thin!  Overall, a culinary experience that is worth the travel, we cannot find the right word to describe it: my daughter suggested an Italian word, which doesn’t really have a proper translation in English: commuovente."

DiverXO,50,Just Amazing.,"Just Amazing.  To come over, here is a whole experience. It is like food Disney Land. The chef made art with food, and it is an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  No budget place. Dinner for two with wine will run well over USD$700, and you must make a reservation with weeks in advance."

DiverXO,50,I don't have the words,"We visited Diverxo for my husband's birthday and what a great it was.  From arrival to leaving there wasn't a thing to be faulted. We were greeted by the staff and taken on a tour of the kitchen which was just wonderful. To see all the chefs involved in creating our epic meal was just wow... We were seated and our waiter Jose introduced himself. Massive praise for him he was friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. Then our amazing journey began... There aren't any words to describe the food as well as I'd like, it was exceptional! The attention to detail was fabulous even down to the spatula style cutlery to gather up every taste of food was an amazing idea. Every course was the best course ☺ not sure how you'd pick out of all the food that was served. We left very full and very happy.. What an absolutely perfect birthday.."

DiverXO,50,"Honestly, i have been to a","Honestly, i have been to a few 3 star restaurant, but this one is my absolut favorit!!! Why? Here some points:    Service is unlike many of those high end reataurant not intrusive, they make you feel special kind of homy cosy attentive but not over attentive where you feel like someone is spyiing on you! Special thanks to Clarissa sei grande!    Place is just mindbubbling like dipping in to a bizarr world apart! I loved it!    Culinary wise its a voyage of flavour textures that made my mind blow away.    Congrats to a young great chef and his whole crew!!  Thanks to all for a wonderful night in a culnary trip that i wont forget!  Salvatore"

DiverXO,30,"Nice staff, food ok but not","Nice staff, food ok but not great. I personally find all the restaurant with a very questionable sense of esthetic. I have been in provocative restaurants like The Alchemist in Copenhagen but this one simply don’t work totally, and the food is not 3 Michelin star in my opinion, maybe 2 if we are kind"

DiverXO,30,Decent meal but overrated.,"I just finished touring Spain where I ate at El Cellar Con Roca, Disfrutar, Lasarte, DiverXO and Terraza Casino/Paco Roncero. They are all great restaurants except DiverXO. Indeed, in Madrid, my meal at Terraza Casino/Paco Roncero was significantly better than DiverXO.    Several of the courses were pretty but were average in taste. In particular the indian inspired early courses while OK were not better than that from an average indian restaurant. Service was also spotty. Many times we needed to try to get a waiters attention to have water or wine refilled. The bill at DiverXO was more than the other 4 restaurants and came no where near the experience. In fact the bill at DiverXO was almost twice that of Terraza Casino because the food and wine were higher priced.    The place has a hip feel and is a cool atmosphere but I wouldn't go again. I don't understand the 3 michelin stars."

DiverXO,10,After visiting 100's of top restaurants there is bound to be one bad one.,"My wife and I have traveled the world for food, it has became a passion. In these travels we have ate at top 50 restaurants on 6 continents and in all of those travels the lack of care by DiverXO is without question the worst in the world. When we visit restaurants we often find that the food is 1/2 of the experience and the care by their staff is the other 1/2. I feel very confident in saying the service at DiverXO has to be the absolute worst in the world.    I don't know if it is because they have had such demand that they no longer care, or if they are just resting on the food and not caring about the customer. We booked a trip to the Madrid and San Sebastian area and secured reservations at 10 different Michelin Stared restaurants for my wife and two of our friends. Three weeks before the trip our friend had to have surgery and was no longer able to attend. We immediately reached out to all 10 restaurants and 9 of the 10 showed amazing customer service. the one exception is DiverXO. They stated we could either cancel or pay for the two extra meals. when I requested to speak with a manager they stated the same thing and were very unhelpful. at one point even saying ""you should have planned better"". How do you plan for an unexpected surgery? This shows an amazing lack of empathy and care about the customer.    Even with me writing this review I am positive they do not care, because they are still sold out. However, if you have a choice of places to visit, in an area with such great food, choose somewhere else that cares about their guests."

DiverXO,50,Fabulous,"Beautiful space. Interesting. Innovative. Comfortable with probably the best dining chairs I have ever sat in. (which is just as well because the meal lasts around 4 hours). Maybe a bit overlit for me but at least you can see the fabulous food!  Service was absolutely top notch and more or less flawless. The food - 23 or small plates - was truly wonderful... modern, inventive with, in general, superb balance of flavours. Nothing seemed gimmicky or unnecessary. Fixed menu only (with some variation possible for food allergies) but no vegan/veggie options.Really worth the visit."

DiverXO,50,Amazing Amazing Meal!,"From the moment you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by magic. This was such a great and special evening! The servers were welcoming, we were given an informative tour of the kitchen, and were able to meet the head chef. All of the courses were beautiful and were full of many amazing flavors. There was such a great variety of flavors. We especially loved the desserts, as they were incredible! Special thank you to Alberto for making the night a lot more fun based on his great service!"

DiverXO,50,Great!!,"Exceptional experience, fantastic food, unbeatable attention. An experience worth living once in a lifetime"

Restaurant Milka,50,Superb experience,"We visited Milka for the first time, with plenty of expectations, but a bit sceptic - questioning, if we should rather opt for some safe (previously tested) fine dining option. But, what a experience! Splendid food and overall experience. First dish already put me somewhere between Alps and Scandinavia. Local ingredients, with a déjà vu of flavours from one of my nicest Scandinavian tastings, experienced at the Gíslasson’s Dill in Reykjavík. Nice experiences continued from plate to plate, till the end… Will be back for sure. And keep the relaxed atmosphere till then :)"

Restaurant Milka,50,LOVELY EVENING,"We had a wonderful evening at Milka restaurant, our meal was amazing , everything was perfectly presented and cooked , also the service was at it's best, really good experience"

Restaurant Milka,50,Incredible experience,"We visited the restaurant for our Anniversary whilst on holiday in Kranjska Gora. The whole evening was simply outstanding - location, service, food, wine. Lenart the Sommelier was a highlight, incredible wine knowledge and took the time to talk through each drink with us.  Anyone who is looking for an evening of delights then this is the restaurant for you!"

Restaurant Milka,50,Milka,"At the gorgeous guesthouse Milka in Kranjska Gora, I had an amazing food experience with my wife and friends. We were warmly welcomed by the very friendly staff from the kitchen. We decided on the 7-course menu. Every course was expertly accompanied with delicious wine to enhance the taste of the food. My wife chose non-alcoholic drinks which perfectly accompanied the food, as well. Each drink was expertly described in a very interesting way by the extremely talented and pleasant sommelier. We also had the chance to visit some of the rooms which were designed in a very modern way. Even though the rooms’ materials (bedding, fabric, etc.) were modern and chic, they were made in a sustainable way. Each room overlooks the Alps giving one an almost fairly-tale like view of lake Jasna.    I can’t recommend this place enough for anyone seeking a modern but yet traditional break. Milka is a wonderful place in which one can relax and enjoy marvellous tastes, gorgeous interior and surrounded by beautiful nature. One thing I really loved was the slippers – the only plastic thing in the house - made from recycled plastic. This was the cherry on the very tasty cake."

Restaurant Milka,50,Stunning in Every way,"Quite simply the best meal of my life. I knew it had achieved a Michelin Star in a relatively short space of time so was expecting something very nice but my expectations were blown out of the water. The restaurant had to change our original booking but even the alternative booking was made with the utmost professionalism. My wife and I had the seven course taster but really it was 12 courses at least, each as exquisite as the next. The staff were exceptional and went above and beyond to ensure it was an unforgettable culinary experience. And the setting, wow. Destined for 2 Stars without a doubt. Book this restaurant before it won't be possible."

Restaurant Milka,50,Congrats to the 🌟-Team for the first Michelin Star,We are so happy to have this uprising STAR here nearby to Austrian and Italian borders! Congratulations to this young enthuastic Milka-Team!! Keep it up and we are looking forward to our next „Food-Experience“ at your stunning location!

Restaurant Milka,50,out of this world,one of our best restaurant experiences. this will be a star restaurant in no time. exceptional dishes and staff. worth a visit when in Slovenia!!!!

Restaurant Milka,50,Amazing experience!!,"My wife and I travelled to Slovenia for the first time approximately a week ago and ate at your lovely restaurant last night! The food was fantastic and we were delighted by the thoughtfulness and detail oriented approach. Everything seemed very well thought out- the kind man who works in your restaurant who picked the wild flowers added a very personal elegant touch. The stemware being from the same city as your sommelier and our waiter Dominic. Everything dovetailed so beautifully and added heart and warmth to the experience.    My wife and I both ordered the nonalcoholic pairing and we were blown away. The food was clearly amazing and the complexity and compliment that the pairings brought with each dish made the experience feel truly holistic. Our meal would not have been the same without it.    My wife and I like to visit fine dining restaurants where ever we travel in the world and we had never experienced a pairing like that before. We found in addition to the pairing being complex, remarkable and delicious, not drinking alcohol helps you stay present and appreciate the full immersive experience of the food.    Thank you for the wonderful evening and a very special thank you to Dominic for the wonderful explanations behind the food and drinks!"

Restaurant Milka,50,Unequivocal hospitality,"I don’t even know how to begin describing the magical experience we had at Milka. My fiancé and I traveled from New York to Slovenia for the first time and decided to stay in Kranjska Gora for some hiking. I came across Milka from a travelers blog and decided to surprise my fiancé with a nice dinner to celebrate our recent engagement. We had no expectations and had just spent the last few days enjoying a wedding with Michelin coursed meals at both Ljubljana Castle and Bled Castle. However, we have to say that this experience at Milka topped all. From the moment we walked onto the resturant patio, we could sense how special this resturant is. Not only is it located right on Lake Jasna with a gorgeous view of the surrounding mountains, the resturant architecture was well designed with their guests in mind. We noticed the electric car ports in their parking lot, which we later found out had heat flooring to protect against the winter snow. The overall feel of the restaurant harmonized with its surrounding. We were greeted by the head sommelier Lenart, who I realized I had been in constant communication with prior. Even before meeting, I had inquired about some dietary restrictions and he had assured that all would be taken care of. Once we were escorted to our table, our host Dominique offered me the chair facing the mountain directly so that I could have a fuller view. And to start, we were offered four different types of water - sparkling, still and at room or cold temperature. Since we found it hard to find bottled water in Slovenia, having so many options for simply water was incredible! But more so the thoughtfulness was memorable. Our hosts then came by with some sparkling options and delicate appetizers. Each had such a unique aroma, taste and texture that was both well balanced and creative. After which we proceeded with seven meticulously crafted courses and the perfect pairings. Given one of us was vegetarian with nut allergies and the other pescatarian, I'm sure we made it challenging for the chef to prepare such an out of the ordinary meal while staying true to their mission and local ingredients. Nonetheless the chef not only honored our request, but also exceeded our expectations in delivering such an outstanding meal. To celebrate our special occasion, the kitchen team even prepared an additional experimental cake that was truly amazing. Lenart was also well versed with all the local and international wines and knew exactly how to pair our dishes whether it be alcoholic or non alcoholic. The non alcoholic options were all exquisite and made in house by Dominique. We felt very taken care of in every aspect of our dining experience. All our hosts were aware of each detail whether it be the placement of our plating, glasses and silverware, adjusting our seats, bringing a blanket as the sun set and even lending me their own suit jacket as it grew chilly. As our evening ended and we were planning to walk back to our hotel across the lake, our hosts graciously offered to drive us back. The hospitality at Milka is not just one of professionalism but of true care. Thank you for making our engagement ever so special. Our experience with everyone at Milka will be remembered for a lifetime."

Restaurant Milka,50,The connection with nature is reflected in both the accommodation and the culinary experience,"The connection with nature is reflected in both the accommodation and the culinary experience.  It was a truly unforgettable time spent, where the friendly staff greeted us with open arms and a smile, and escorted us to the beautiful Rock Suite and left us with our mouths open. We had a hard time expecting an evening and pampering our palates, we had very high expectations. The food impressed us. The plates were a real feast for the eyes and we could hardly wait to finish the presentation of each dish with an interesting story of preparation and origin of each ingredient and we were able to try this explosion of flavors. I was most surprised by the originality of the prepared non-alcoholic accompaniment to the drink, which they prepare themselves.  Breakfast was also very tasty and prepared with indigenous dishes at the highest level.  After all this great food, a walk around the lake was just right.  Everything Milka offers is intended for relaxation and enjoyment. Phenomenal food, postcard-like view, relaxation in the sauna, friendly staff .....  It has a very good starting point for walks and hikes in nature. I highly recommend it."

Restaurant Milka,50,Remarkable alpine fine dinning,"We had 7-course dinner, it's the best I have eaten in Slovenia. Amazing presentation and exquisite wine pairing. Chef David has made amazing job together with the team."

Restaurant Milka,50,Dinner not to be missed in Kranjska gora,"My partner and I visited a restaurant during our weekend stay. Wonderful restaurant with a beautiful view of Lake Jasna. The food was excellent, we also received a short 'lesson' on the philosophy of local production and the involvement of local products in the preparation of excellent dishes. The experience of tasting wine with and without food was interesting. Perfect weekend with perfect food and wine accompaniment."

Restaurant Milka,50,"Honest food, professional service.","The food was spectacular, honest, full of flavour, simple but in a way really complexed. Service was really nice, attentive, knowledgeable, but at the same time relaxed so it made me feel like home. I recomend it to everyone that appreciate great food and great service."

Restaurant Milka,50,Utterly stunning,"At Restaurant Milka you feel special.    I’ve visited at the end of winter and indulged in seven-course menu with wine pairing. It is a carefully curated adventure that chef David and sommelier Lenart take you with care and intrigue. The thought that has been put in this menu and pairing is nothing short of exquisite. The wine shines a light on the food and vice versa. The tasting menu is the result of great creatives inspired by the Alps, world cuisine and phenomenal hospitality.    Only an extremely experienced and innovative team could craft this fine dining feast. I think the Alpine cuisine has never been better represented and I can’t wait to visit again. It is truly remarkable and one-of-a kind."

Restaurant Milka,50,Exquisite culinary experience,"This place is very welcoming, excellent service, tasty and aesthetically perfected dishes, which are also seasonal and local. 7 course menu ends up being many more plates than 7. Even though I usually prefer to go for wine pairing, I tried non-alcohol pairing this time and I did not regret it for a second. I never had such special drinks before and they matched the dishes perfectly.  I highly recommend this place!"

Restaurant Milka,50,"Amazing food, superb attention to detail.","Me and my wife had dinner and breakfast at this restaurant.    First of all I have to hand it to the staff witch are simply amazing, friendly and their attention to details is out of this world. Every course of the dinner was unique experience, but telling the same story from appetizers to the desert. For a while now I am not allowed to drink anymore alcohol, so I got used to just drink some juice instead of having wine pairing. But not in this restaurant, they had different plans for me! For the first time I experienced non-alcoholic pairing, witch was a very pleasant surprise. And everything complemented the food just like wine would.    Breakfast was also superb and very big. Everything was prepared fresh and the staff brings something to the table all the time. When you already think you are finished they bring the most amazing cake that you simply can't resist. I'm used to having continental breakfast at hotels, so this experience was on a whole new level.    100% would recommend this to anyone."

Restaurant Milka,50,A wonderful experience,All the staff want you to enjoy every moment of every course. Knowledge and love of food and where and how it is sourced. And you will enjoy every mouthful.

Restaurant Milka,50,Best tasting-menu in my life,"The best tasting menu I have ever had (and I have had many all over the world). The food is perfect. The service is perfect. Even with ""only"" the small tasting menu of 7 dishes, there were probably about 15 dishes on the table in total. Plus extra drinks. All in perfect harmony. Do not miss this restaurant!"

Restaurant Milka,50,Superb place to eat and drink,"Absolutely blown away by the tasty and delicious food at Milka restaurant. Perfect location with amazing views on the lake. Very kind and welcoming staff. If ever around a must place to go, don't forget to order a bombastic chocolate brownies!!"

Restaurant Milka,50,Extraordinary! dishes. Creative cuisine. Amazing food.,"If you love a firework of flavors combined with perfect preparation & presentation, you must try it. .. and of course there are some gems hidden in the cellar if you want some special wines or other beverages.    Most likely the only restaurant I would really miss.  I never regret a single visit. I'm sure you won't too."

Restaurant Milka,40,The food is amazing and the,The food is amazing and the staff is normally very nice but this one time the staff member just took a chair from our table and he talked to the customers at the next table for around 15-20 minutes

Restaurant Milka,50,Excellent choice ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,"5 stars from us.  Excellent job guys.  Your team is nice, they took care of basically everything. Choosing a proper wine for our meal(s). The food was just amazing, all the textures and tastes. And terrace view is astonishing.  We are looking forward to come back again any time soon.  We had white wine from Slovenian Karst/Brdo region - Iaquin.  From food we recommend ravioli and deer meat with shepherds pie the most.  For dessert you should try baked polenta with orange ice cream and sour cream. You won't regret your decission, not even for a moment."

Restaurant Milka,50,Excellent,"Milka team prepares fusion, local and tradicional Slowene food in a modern way. Tastes are divine authentic and unforgettable."

Restaurant Milka,50,Extremely good food as well,"Extremely good food as well as location! All the dishes we ordered were very tasty and full of flavors! In the end, we were served with prerfect blueberry pie. highly recommended! Matjaz&Katja"

Restaurant Milka,50,Excellent,"One of the best restaurants I had ever been. I was there before but this time the chef exceeded my expectations. The food was great, tart with baked blueberries were even better. The wine escort was great and well picked up by the staff. The staff was were professional and friendly at the same time. I really enjoyed and highly recommend this place."

Restaurant Milka,50,Must go,Very happy we found this restaurant with such increadible food. The service is great and the staff are very friendly and nice. The view from the outside terrace is also breathtaking looking over lake Jasna and the mountains behind it.

Restaurant Milka,20,Really disappointed,"Was really disappointed with the dinner, I was there last year and i had a great experience so i wanted to try new 6 course tasting menu.    Non of the courses was even close to the level one would expect for this price.    “Soup reduction” (3rd course) is too intense and barely eatable.    It seems like all the dishes are half done, they all lack something to remember them.  And the portions are a lot smaller then last year.    Maybe it has something to do with that they are closing the place down at the end of the month.    But it is still good atmosphere and amazing view.    Kr, Matic"

Restaurant Milka,20,Not worth it,"After eating in a few restaurants that serve local food - cooked on a higher level, this visit was a mess. 4 of us took a degustation menu with 6 courses included. All of the courses were too small and the served food was average. The last course before the desert was a deer in a sauce with deer pie. The meat stank really bad and it was chewy. Really disgusting. The ""star"" for me was a soup - with a cognac. It was so salty we couldn't eat it. We payed 55€ for this dinner - each. If you are thinking of eating a dinner in Kranjska Gora I recommend you go somewhere else. Kranjska Gora has several good reastaurants who also serve local food. I don't recommend Milka restaurant."

Restaurant Milka,50,Amazing,The food was amazing and staff super friendly. Everything was home made and the herbs came from there own backyard.

Restaurant Milka,50,Wow!!! What an unexpected suprise,"Next to lake Jansa, terrace with wonderful lake view. Not a local simple dish but well crafted dishes.  No actual menu but a set menu (3 course wonderful gazpacho with ice ricotta , main choice of lamb or fish and great desserts ). Our 9 years old ask for kids dish (got fresh bolognese pasta); a veggie teenager (ricotta and mushroom dumpling, extraordinary); a no gluten no lactose teenager (fresh non gluten bolognese pasta). They just improvise any need or request. 10 out of 10 for the experience."

Restaurant Milka,50,Amazing!,"Truly one of the best restaurant we've been so far. Every dish is a pleasant surprise, with great presentation and even better plate design. And what is best - very relaxed atmosphere, you can be yourself, normal, just enjoying your food with friends. The staff was super friendly. I definitely recommend! Great experience, hope to come back soon. Thank you team Milka."

Restaurant Milka,20,Not recommended,"We were planning to end our vacation on a high note with a special dinner, but were unfortunately disappointed.    To start with, upon arrival the owner didn't greet us and almost looked annoyed that we disturbed his peace. We nevertheless hoped that the rest of the experience in the restaurant would make it up for that unwelcoming initial attitude.    We asked for dining options and were suggested a six course tasting menu. We had concerns that it might be too much food as we had a late lunch but in the end decided to go for it.    Well, the food was tasty, except for the dessert which was a really really poor interpretion of the famous Pavlova dessert. Also, the portion sizes were super tiny and we were definitely disappointed in this regard.    One thing that was also highly disturbing for us was the outfit of the staff. The owner, who also served us food, was wearing a lousy t-shirt, bermuda shorts and flip-flops. Just not something that we find appropriate for a restaurant that advertises itself as Haute Cuisine.    If you consider yourself a foodie, I honestly suggest you skip this restaurant and rather pick any other in Kranjska Gora. This one is not worth the price and overall experience.    Aleš"

Restaurant Milka,50,"Absolutely unexpected, to","Absolutely unexpected, to find such a high-quality, very creative and outstanding kitchen together with such a stunning view. Highly recommended, if you appreciated very good food & bring some time with you."

Restaurant Milka,50,An excellent surprise .we had,"An excellent surprise .we can observe throught out the plate . Coming out of the kitchen , that it is prepared by a great chef . Lots of effort and details , technique . Hats off  Great selection of good wine that goes with the food . Dessert as I am not too sweet I took a panacotta again very supprise . The best panacotta ever . It was a lavender panacotta serve roasted nuts an a blue berry jelly all topped with a a crumble .  It’s is very rare to have a conductive string from the start to finish . Even the espresso at the end was very good we can call it a perfect espresso .  For the service : I will not exprime my opinion .    I can give a 2 star Michelin for the food  Merci"

Restaurant Milka,50,Really worth the trip,"The restaurant is 20 mins walking distance to kranjska gora center. It is definitely worth the trip for the scenery, food and the service. The food is a nice change to all the pizza, burgers etc you get by the ski slopes.. The restaurant serves really delicous / fresh food with an extensive wine list which they know by heart and they take their time going over the list until you decide.. We had one of the short tasting menus, everything was so fresh, very well prepared. I cant wait to go back and try the real tasting menu. Definitely recommend it for a nice dining experience."

Restaurant Milka,50,"Perfect restaurant, great","Perfect restaurant, great atmosphere and of course amazing high couture cuisine made with love. Must see place for real foodie."

Restaurant Milka,50,Perfect meal for Valentines 💕or anytime .,Wow! Nothing more needs saying other than ate here today and booked again for tomorrow!! Cannot wait ! Lovely stroll from kranjska and perfection at the end of it ! Well done 👍

Restaurant Milka,50,A complete experience,"Making reservations, arranging the number of guests and all in all logistics was a breeze. As soon as we arrived for the end-of-the-year company dinner we were greeted in a very cozy place. A winter's chill outside and a warm welcoming, unique inside. The tunes were already caught in the ear - not too loud and as we sat we were ready for a great experience. We had a seven course menu - one of us had a vegan menu. We enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed the wine pairings with a few interesting twists - a beer and a cognac. We loved the tempo. Each dish was unique and presented with different styles, interesting flavors and still somehow managed to stand together as a whole. The vegan menu did not by any stretch look less cared for with a focus of its own. It was a perfectly spent evening and everyone enjoyed it; those more cuisine savvy, those who have never tried anything like it and those who like simple food were all thrilled. The service was exceptional - fun, natural, unpretentious, proud and knowledgeable of what they are serving. If there was anything we did not like we could have told them and they would improvise. Always a sense of being cared for.  A real hedonistic experience. Cannot wait to return."

Restaurant Milka,50,Excellent,A pleasent gourmet surprise. An exceptional meal in a domestic environment. Not to be mmissed when in the neighbourhood.

Restaurant Milka,50,Simply the best food I’ve ever eaten,"Words fail to impress the sheer deliciousness of the food at this restaurant. It was so good, we went twice! The staff are friendly, engaging and helpful. The food was spectacular. You’re a fool if you do not visit.... honestly!"

Restaurant Milka,50,Tasting menu,An excellent experience with the staff taking the time to explain the food presented to you before you ate each course. The flavours were delightful and the staff checked to understand if any of the party had any food allergies. The staff demonstrated a passion for hospitality ensuring their guests enjoyed the whole experience of tasting different dishes from each plate. We ate on Friday evening and the restaurant was busy with other large and small parties however the timing of the arrival of each plate was very well organised allowing both palates and stomachs to enjoy each offering. We also ate off the set and à la carte menu for our Sunday lunch which was delicious.

Restaurant Milka,50,Christmas Lunch,"Excellent Restaurant, we had the seven course tasting menu, it was fantastic, paired wine, our Granddaughter had a three course menu which was equally as good. Staff very friendly and helpful. If you are in the area or even a drive it will be worth a visit."

Restaurant Milka,50,Unique food and ambient,Excelent place to take some time off in an homelike ambient with a food that that you wish will never end. Have to try.

Restaurant Milka,50,Best,"Both the view, the food and the service leads to Milka being the best restaurant in Kranjska Gora. Definitely worth the trip."

Restaurant Milka,40,FINE DINNER,"Finally one restaurant in Kranjska gora that does not serve fast and frozen dishes. Their tasting menu is great. Extraordinary use of ingredients and miscellaneous wines. The prices are not average, the need only to improve the time of service as the time for dinner is extremely long, which was mentioned by others in their comments. Other ok."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Good experience with little drawbacks for a 2* Michelin,"Overall experience was positive. They use interesting ingredients and a well-balanced menu, the staff was positive and helpful. Subjectively I was missing more than 1 wow effect item on the menu, but I understand that can be me.    However, there are a few things I would like to point out which per my  understanding should not happen in this kind of restaurant.    1) as I was booking the table I asked for a savory ending of the menu as I'm not much into sweets. One week before the visit someone from the restaurant was checking the reservation and I repeated my request in the email. No reaction and of course I had a sweet ending. A simple answer ""Sorry sir, it's not possible"" would be enough and I would understand.    2) sitting at the chef's table and having the chef in the kitchen would be nice to have a visit at our table asking how we are or presenting some of his signature meal. Especially when for the whole evening only 4 tables were booked. It's not mandatory, however, at this level of the restaurant, and paying more for seeing the kitchen it's standard per my experience.    3) At the beginning of the main part of the menu they literally fumed us with smoke from cherry wood and truffle. Without any reason, no pairing with an upcoming meal, just for fun. Subjectively for me, it was a bit weird. They should make at least a story behind the action."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Great and recommended! But not suitable for vegetarians.,"Excellent service, nice atmosphere and delicious food. But NOT FOR VEGETARIANS! The meat dishes were fab, but there is only one starter and one main dish suitable for vegetarians and they were both so light, that after finishing our dinner, we needed to head out to a place nearby to feed our vegetarians. :( The effort for having a vegetarian dish is appreciated, but this course too should be a sufficient meal for an adult. Especially at the price point of 70 EUR/ person."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Business dinner,"First visit this year.  They have changed in the menu but for sure kept the high level. We chose starter, main and dessert. We asked for a wine and got recommended a Hungarian Grand Cry. Excellent choice for the food.  I’ll be back again later this year."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,One of the best meals I have had in Hungary,"I have been dining out in Hungary for nearly 50 years: this place is one of the best I have visited anywhere in the country. An indication of its excellence is the fact that it was busy on a cold Monday afternoon in February. The menu is just the right size, wine as advised by the waiter suited the meal perfectly, service was at just the right level. Cannot find a fault with it. The fish starter was sublime.  I will return."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Worth the visit,This place serves great dishes made with quality ingredients and top class kitchen technic. No wonder the chef Istvan Pesti got 2 Michelin stars in October 2022 for the adjacent Platan Gourmet restaurant.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,You have to try the desserts :),"The restaurant is in the best location, next to the lake. Staff are professional: attentive but not intrusive. The modernised dishes of Hungarian cuisine are delicious. And the desserts are like a work of art :)"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,A quiet Thursday night,"Delicious tafelspitz and breaded mangalica pork. Nice ambiance. Good service. Always a pleasure to eat there. Wine recommendations are usually local ones...not always very good, but always a nice experience."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Delicious desserts,If you have a sweet tooth then this place is for you. We stopped by after a nice walk just to eat some desserts. We have tried 3 kinds and all of them were delicious. I would recommend the lemon tart but you cannot go wrong by picking any item of the menu. Worth to visit this restaurant.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Very impressive,"Lovely location next to the lake at charming Tata, between the finely restored Eszterházy palace and the castle. Shady terrace overlooking the water. Delicious food - my prawns with pasta and peas in a terrific sauce was superb as was the Vietnamese beef soup. The sort of food you’d get in Sydney at its best. Excellent service."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Simply excellent,"The location in beautiful, sitting at the sun under that amazing old tree is unique. Considering that it is only 45 minutes by car from Budapest, in my opinion this place is always a very valid reason to go for a short trip to Tata. Absolutely worth the trip.  I chose the Tafelspitz, and it was served perfectly, probably when I was in Austria I have never eaten such a good one: very good and intense broth, and the beef tender and not dry at all. The sauces very nice and balanced. Artisanal bread for the bone marrow.  My wife had the breaded and fried mangalica (karaj), extraordinary. Very juicy, cooked to perfection, crunchy and light, any trace of grease.  The desserts just marvellous, between the best you can find in the whole country, even in Budapest you will find few of this level. One of the few mille-feuille worthy of the name here in Hungary, buttery and perfectly crunchy, not wet at all. Their version of baba is also very good. Good coffee. Polite and professional service. Absolutely recommended."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Cake with a view,"Great atmosphere both indoors and outdoors; nice view. The cakes are amazing, try all of them. Recommended."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Astonishing Place,"My husband and I were celebrating our one year wedding anniversary here. Everything about this place is excellent! While we were sitting under the shade of the huge platan tree, enjoying the chef's masterpieces, we also had stunning view on the lake. It is admirable how someone can create the perfect symphony of flavour and vision in one plate. People who work there are very polite and professional. The cherry on top is the lounge music accompanied by live guitar. We are very grateful for the remarkable experience!"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Excellent fine dining outside of Budapest,"Located approx 1 hour from center of Budapest in a fairly small village this restaurant delivers surprisingly sophisticated food, service and overall experience. The setting is nice as well, on a small lake, castle and park-like area. It's also adjacent to a boutique hotel. Food is 'modern fine dining' style and combines Hungarian and international ingredients for some creative combinations that generally work. Extremely reasonably priced for the quality and service is great as well! It's quite popular and not that many tables so you need to book in advance no matter what time/day (we tried 3 or 4 times before actually getting in!). Definitely worth it for an easy day-trip from Budapest or between BP and Vienna as it's not far of the highway!"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Perfect,"The dinner as well as the wine recommendations were just perfect. Also the service staff was really helpful with our choices. We really loved, that they gave us a table with extra space for our dog. Although it is (rightfully) a bit pricey we will definitely come again!"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,New experience,"If you want to try the modern Hungarian Cuisine with a lot of art, new taste, you must visit Platan. The best experience for all my life. Excellent service! Happy New Year 2020!"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Happy little surprise,Visited the place after a friendly recommendation. The place was full but the waiter Cava (the gray one) managed to us a lovely place next to the lake. Wanted to eat something quick but the waiter advised to us full menu with some wine. Will return for sure.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Highly recommend this place,"We love it a lot this cosy place. We ate there twice, first day we take dinner and next day we ate at lunch. Both times was everything perfect. We tried different dishes, and all was very nice and good. Staff are also very friendly !"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Best restaurant in the area,"If you ever find yourself in the area, you have to go check out Platan. We tried almost everything on the menu and everything was extremely tasty. They serve two types oh home-made beer, which are pretty good. Try some of the local wines, tasty as well. Last but not least, if it’s warm, ask to be seated outside, the view is amazing."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Fine dining by the lake,"Ate lunch at the restaurant. We asked to be seated inside but we're told the AC was not working. Seated outside under the tree had to ask to be moved when the sun got too much and with smokers around us. Soup starters were good although the potatoes in the gulyas somewhat crunchy/hard. Main courses used some fancy techniques but were not particularly special although better than usual restaurant fare. One had a sizeable portion, the other a very small portion. When we asked for desserts we were told we had to go and look at them inside. Too much effort required but they had no problem giving us the ice cream menu. Unless you are someone who likes marketing hype and large servings I would advise against the ice cream. Too much sweetness and cream after the meal really spoilt the earlier courses. Friendly service. Good food although overpriced for what it is (to me as someone who is hardly a gourmand). If I went again I'd just get a starter and be happy."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Get here before gastronomic stars make this off-the-beaten-path beauty inaccessible,"On a 33 degree sweltering afternoon, the lakeside table in the lee of the castle and under a huge Platan, I.e. sycamore, tree promised.much. The restaurant delivered at every level. The menu, while short, caters to both traditional Hungarian tastes - my companion had chicken soup and duck leg with red cabbage while I revelled in the presentation of the duck liver torchon: Beres wine to enhance the flavour of the butter liver, caviar, beetroot, flower, homemade brioche on the slate top of a round wooden box followed by a round succulence of rabbit with mushroom sauce which easily met the highest of new vogue standards. The wine list by the glass is equally recherche. The service was, of course, impeccable; one felt comfortable relying on the server's suggestions. Because of its small size, this superb restaurant seems destined to have to restrict its patrons to those who have the foresight to make reservations long in advance. Get here now."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Lunch at the lake,"We had a nice lunch, bit of a posh restaurant. Really enjoyed the dessert. Location at the lake is excellent."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Food heaven!!,"OMG! This is all I have to say about Platán! Starting from the service, to the amazing location (under a huge platan tree) by the lake, everything about it is just unbeliavably nice! The staff was quick to seat us, the service was impeccable and super friendly. We noted that unfortunately we are in a bit of a hurry (as we were going for a wedding later on), and they made sure we get our food in a super fast time.  The portions were small but extremely delicious, real foodgasm. I hope to return and enjoy a full meal with proper time on my hands. Loved it thank you! Recommend!"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Another fabulous lunch,"This was our second visit to this exceptional farm kitchen- countryside restaurant.  Short but well balanced menu, focusing on seasonal ingredients. Top quality dishes served by professional well trained and knowledgeable staff. The egg consommé was probably in the top 3 soups we have ever eaten, just perfect! Finally we had the chance to taste the divine mille feuille, as last time it was sold out by the time we have finished our lunch.  Platan restaurant has a higher price range than most other Hungarian countryside restaurants, but its well worth the money."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,30,Rude waiter!,"We were guests in the hotel, enjoyed a beautiful day in Tata and were looking forward to a delicious dinner in this stunning setting. Everything was as it should be, very good food and wine, but at the end of our meal we inquired about desserts and were told dismissively to ""go and have a look inside"". At the end of the meal at 9.50 (the restaurant closes at 10), having finished our bottle of wine we asked if we could have two more glasses to round off the meal. Answer fromone of the rude waiters (Csaba): ""NO"". So we asked for the bill. The bill arrived, we paid in cash. The waiter then attempted to rip us off 10,000 huf by ""forgetting"" that i had given him 60,000huf not 50,000huf!!!    So of the 4 waiters 2 were nice, kind and efficient, one thought himself a financial genius and the other (Csaba) just downright rude and lazy. Passing by after a quick stroll we found the waiters drinking wine, having a party and enjoying themselves in the restaurant 20 minutes after saying we were not able to have another glass!    All in all a nice place but the two waiters ruined it by being rude and theiving. Sorry but the Chef/owner deserves more respect from his staff.    PS:Prosecco as always in Hungary not cold,"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Best restaurant in Tata,Small and cozy restaurant which create super delicious food experience. I'll recommend Platan to all who loves food.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,"Fabulous environment, amazing dishes, friendly service",I have found a parking lot really close to the restaurant. I had to wait for my launch partner 20 minutes but it was easy in such a beatiful surroundings. Servers were really nice. I have chosen my dishes from the weekly menu. The lamb was extremely tasty. Unfortunately I could not drink wine though the selection of the place was great and they have some really interesting wines.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,30,Average,"We had a beef soup which was not tasty, the vegetables were hard the meat over cooked. The desert is delicious though. It’s a fancy looking restaurant but the food was average."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Another superb dinner at Platan,"We were a party of four on a business dinner Monday evening at the Platan. The experience was excellent. I have had the good fortune of dining at the Platan many times over the last four years. Monday like all previous times never disappoints. The food is exquisite, wonderfully cooked and presented. The service attentive, professional, and helpful with recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and look forward to returning on my next visit to Tata."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Professional catering at last,"Being a hospitality professional it is always a struggle to find no mistakes and feel comfortable in other establishments.  Visited this place a few years back for lunch and today we decided to stop here for a coffee and cakes.  Our story is a bit strange because 5 adults with 4 kids 3 of them infants with 3 buggies.  We were planning to sit outside, try not to bother the diners in case the babies would start crying.  Now not they have offered us outside seats but they opened an area which was closed Just to be able to sit inside not outside in the cold.  He so offered extra heating and showed us around where we can find the toilet and another room to change the babies.  This is over the top from someone Did not even know us and most of the time parents with young kids are pain in the backdoor for restaurant staff.  All I can say thank you very much for your kindness and also the hospitality.  Cakes were divine too.  Can't recommend enough.  A little treasure I must say."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,30,"Cafe - beautiful but blunt cakes, average coffee","Rating the cafe - average    CHOCOLATE, hazelnut, mulberry  Apart from the chocolate it tasted blunt. The mulberry fruit has a very exciting acidy taste which they managed to conceal altogether. The hazelnut remained in the background as well. The texture and the presentation were fine.    COTTAGE - CHEESE, raspberry  They managed to tune down the flavors again. It tasted pretty much like panna cotta with a similar texture, but with a very slight cottege cheese taste. The presentation and the texture were great.    Not Zserbo  Again the creators were playing with some exciting textures at the expense of the flavors. The walnut cream was very thin, it barely had any walnut taste, the apricot jelly was blunt as well. It contained a few pieces of hard walnut shell. Beautiful presentation but very disappointing taste.    Coffee  Only one type of roast, Italian styled capuccino. Fine but nothing special.    Service: pretty fast.    It's definitely worth a visit, but I don't understand the hype. (perhaps I should try the restaurant sometime)"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Excelent dinner,"Excellent evening dinner with colleague. The starter was inspiring, main course magnificent and the petit four with hot chocolate was the perfect finish..."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Fine dining for an affordable price,"Very close to Budapest, it is easy to come here for a dinner or lunch. Amazing atmosphere, the food is uniqe and delicious. High quialty! Definitely recommended!"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Amazing Dining Experience in Hungary,"Special ingredients, unique textures and combinations, beautiful presentation, creative menu + perfect location"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Best dinner in Hungary ever!!,"This dinner was definitely our best experience in Hungary. It likes a Michelin restaurant, but the price is very decent. The service was really nice and helpful. Besides the main courses, you can’t miss the desserts! The chocolate cake is the best one I’ve ever...More"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Fine dine in a nice milieu,"The restaurant is at a short drive from Budapest ( check your navi app for possible route diversions from highway ). The restaurant has it's own parking, but in a walking distance there are multiple options. Nice building from outside, if the weather allows, outdoor...More"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Great service on the shores of the Lake,"Combination of the unique place, nice food and great service from our charming waiter Robert, made us in Platan Restaurant fully satisfied."

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Very nice restaurant,The restaurant is very good. The food is tasty and the scenery and location are amazing. I would recommend to have a glass of wine outside close to the lake.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,40,Improved a lot since my last visit!,"Last time I wrote a review I was outraged by how we were treated at the restaurant. Today, nothing but the name and and the Super Delicious desserts are the same, everything changed. The menu became like a piece of art, and I’m not talking...More"

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,Food was god,We had a short lunch here. Cafe with milk and cream was excelent. Wort to stop here to eat and have a break.

Platán Gourmet Restaurant,50,"Great atmosphere, food and dessert case",Everything is good about this place. But we especially liked the service. The dessert case is filled to the brim with great choices.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,A must try in Paris,Amazing experience !! From service to quality of food and price point !!! We’ll be back ! Our hostess at the counter was knowledgeable and spoke 3 languages !! He really made a difference when explaining each dish as they were coming !!

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Outstanding!,"Outstanding tasting menu and service, enjoyed atmosphere, which encouraged interaction with Chef's as well as other patrols."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,One star dining at it's best,Incredible dinner for a fantastic price. Service could not have been better. Atmosphere was top notch.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,a touch of genius,"Enjoyment to your eyes and your mouth! The food looks good as much as it tastes, It is not cheap, but, order a few small dishes and enjoy life!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Still a great restaurant,"I’ve eaten here several times as well as in Robochun restaurants in NY and Tokyo. Always an enjoyable experience. The staff is fine tuned and the restaurant runs like a Swiss watch. Fortunately, nothing has changed since the unfortunate passing of Mr. Robochun. Highly recommended."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,10,What a joke i have a reservation made days ago and they let me wait for an hour,"What a joke i have a reservation made days ago and they let me wait for more than an hour to be seated, it took me 25 min to talk to manger they dont respect their costumers"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,10,We booked in the Restaurant and when we arrived they told us they have no reservation. After we showed them the confirma,We booked in the Restaurant and when we arrived they told us they have no reservation. After we showed them the confirmation they made us wait in the bar for a while. We did not like their service at all.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Every dish beautiful and revealing of it's culinary possibilities,"The Discovery Menu offered 9 taste sensations, each revealing great thought on the part of it's creator, not only for flavors but for visual appeal. Everything was perfect and pleasing except the dish that the menu said would be quail filled with foie gras (actually the promise that motivated us into ordering the Discovery Menu) arrived sans foie gras. Service did not live up to the standards of the food: water and wine were placed out of reach but no one paid attention to when it was needed during the meal."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,"A colinary delight, incredible staff: A MUST GO IN PARIS!","The food was AMAZING! The staff was amazing! It was a true culinary delight!    We went there for dinner on a Thursday evening, sat at the bar outdoors. The waiter was incrediy friendly, made great food rexommendations. Everything we ate was nothing short of amazing! The deserts were like a dream (I ate chocolate, my children ate something with coconut). We could not stop talking about the food even days after. When we left, the waiter was busy with another customer, although we had said bye earlier, he came to find us at the exit to say goodbye and thank us for our visit!!    If you have time for only one meal in Paris, go to L’Atelier Joel Robouchon in St Germain!    This has been one of our BEST EXPERIENCES overall anywhere in the world. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Wonderful Experience,"Although seated at the bar (as most couples were), the food and service were special. All the food choices were excellent and the food was as expected, fabulously delicious. Though seated at the bar, it was comfortable and it meant that services was great. Although pricey, I would certainly return."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Rebochon and the Others,"It was seven years since my last taste of Rebochon.  I ordered the same three plates Gyoza, Aubergine and  Quail with Foie Gras, Truffles and Truffled Mashed Potatoes.  The immaculate tastes and textures still amaze me  and the fluid movements of service are dance like.  The colors have tastes that spring up and dazzle  with a wam glow. All else that should be simply is."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,The Best Service I've Ever Experienced,"This wasn't my first Michelin star experience, but it was by far the best. I have literally never had better service. For starters, my wife and I speak little to no french, but the staff spoke plenty of english to help us. The sommelier asked us about our tastes, what we plan on eating, and our experience with French wines.    My wife and I did the tasting menu. Every single dish was truly outstanding. The wine compliment each dish superbly.    The meal actually came out cheaper than I expected, which was a nice touch. Don't be fooled, you'll still well over 150€ per person"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Amazing experience.,"The food, atmosphere and service was amazing. We left feeling fully satisfied and yearning to come back. This a “must visit” restaurant if you are looking for romantic night or want to discover authentic cuisines. You will not be disappointed."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Unbelievable,"Amazing!!! Truly enjoyed the whole experience!! The food is exquisite and the service and attention was really enjoyable! The hamburger with foie Gras, and the baby lamp chops are a must!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Exceptional Everything,"This restaurant is exceptional. Exceptional food. Exceptional service. Exceptional wine. Some of our favorites were the ceviche, truffle pasta, and pizza. I’d recommend against the prefixed menu though if you’re not a big fan of foie gras."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Our Most Memorable Meal during our stay in Paris!,"This was truly the best meal that we had during our week here in Paris! I was on the fence given some of the reviews I’d seen, but we were not disappointed! I started with the delicious rose champagne. We ordered the calamari and lamb chops as starters and they melted in our mouths! Our mains, carbonara and black cod were expertly prepared. The service could not have been better, evenly paced, not rushed. Every course was snapshot worthy! We were too full to order dessert, but they treated us to some Madeleines and caramels to end the experience. The tab was half of what I expected , albeit pricey (250€ with 2 drinks), but well worth it for quality! Can’t wait to visit the Vegas location in June!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,A Tired establishment stuck in the past,"Unfortunately this restaurant has passed its prime and seems stuck in the shadow of its former glory. We visited the St Germain version of L’Atilier and had a myriad of dishes. The theme seemed to be the same from every dish, it was innovative 20 years ago but now seems very dated. So many restaurants have taken versions of these dishes and modernized them that now the original seems stuck in the past.  The tuna tataki appears now on every generic restaurant menu. The hamburgers with fois can be had at most fancy burger places, the tartare seems stuck in the 90’s with an over abonance of mayo and pickles that dates the dish.    The white fish, and even the famous pomme purée are all common place now, the secret is out it’s half butter half potato. I think the staff has forgot why L’Atilier was made. It was a space of innovation and invention which struck against the established rules of French fine dining. Unfortunately the restaurant seems old and tired in its approach and to anyone who frequents any of Paris’s other modern restaurants like Frenchie, or even bar Frenchie which has a similar concept will feel going to L’Atilier is closer to a visit to grandmas house than to an innovative dining experience. 2 stars."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,"A mixed experience, varying from absolutely superb to very average","An old time favorite of mine. I love the concept of serving top, top class food at a bar with highly attentive and professional service. This time around we still experienced some delicious dishes, but regrettably also some which certainly were below past standards. Especially the pasta dishes were very dissapointing and really not more than average. I have to admit Joel Rebouchon has lost some of its nerve following the Covid periode. I sincerely hope they pick it up again."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,We will come back,Outstanding Great food and fantastic service in a very relaxed atmosphere. Stylish interior - enjoyed sitting at the bar looking into the kitchen. We will come back.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Michelin fast food?,Certainly an experience and whilst I can understand why it does not suit everyone we thoroughly enjoyed it and the food.  First up - be aware you sit at a bar rather than a table. No choice but to cozy up to your neighbours and enjoy their conversation even if you don’t want to!  Service is brisk! They clearly want more than one sitting. Order and you will receive…  Staff are also brisk but friendly once you engage with them. I suspect they are expected to serve too many customers.  Noisy ? I prefer buzzy and good to see the chefs at work.  Food - we really enjoyed and they flexed the menu for us which was great. All beautifully presented. Not sure about the cooking of the foie gras though. Serves me right for having it.  Cost - not cheap. It in my view worth it and you are in a major European city so what do you expect.  Go for the experience but go with an open mind and enjoy what it is. Michelin fast food!

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,20,Oops...,"Music a bit too loud and some food servings too oily. Still a nice experience with some interesting dishes, but shouldn't rely only on their brand. Price not justified. Great service though."

Le Séjour Café,50,Charming Delight,"I have tried this restaurant few times, I vacation at Nice every summer and have been going to this restaurant for the last 4 years, their food is excellent, very friendly and great service, I have had almost everything on the menu and have loved everything, it is just the best!"

Le Séjour Café,50,Classic French Bistro,A classic French bistro. Everything was delicious! Sea bream was excellent. Waitstaff and hostess could not have been more friendly. I would go back in a heartbeat.

Le Séjour Café,50,Stunning x,"This is a must visit! Stunning food, outstanding service. You MUST book in advance.. fabulous touches the amuse bouche is always stunning… tickling your taste buds for what is to follow… my sister and I adore this restaurant!"

Le Séjour Café,30,Started perfectly but……,Lovely atmosphere and delightful service ……thé amuse Bouche was a corn vichyssoise..superb ….thé watermelon vichyssoise was less so and the beef tartar even less. So. We left somewhat disappointed c’est la vie

Le Séjour Café,50,Would have given it six stars if I could,"One of the tips for a good review, as proposed by Tripadvisor, is to share the good and the bad. So I have thought long and hard about the good and the bad of Le Séjour, and, to be quite honest, I can't think of any bad - not even as nitpicking grumpy old Englishman. It was just perfect: a refreshing change from 24/7 pizza offered by the end-to-end feeding outlets on Rue de France.    At Le Séjour the menu is short but imaginative (grilled marrow bone and croaker fish, anyone?) However unusual the dish, everything about the restaurant tells you that you will enjoy eating it.    The service is professional (so rare nowadays) but friendly. And, for those who need it, they speak good English. Don't be afraid to ask about the dishes on the menu or about the wine: they are keen to explain and to help you to find what you want.    It is not cheap - 160 Euros for dinner for 2 with wine. But from the moment you sit down you know that it is going to be worth it. We went twice in a week's stay in Nice and, somewhat unusually, had as much pleasure there the second time as the first.    You will almost certainly need to book, which can't yet do online. So phone them, even if your French is limited to ""allo!"". And be adventurous with the menu; it will reward you with a really good meal."

Le Séjour Café,50,"An excellent experience, one of the best restaurants in Nice.",Travelled to Nice for a week of eating and drinking and our meal at Le Sejour Cafe was the best of the week. A wonderful restaurant with excellent food and wine. The staff are also exceptional and made our lunch a wonderful experience.

Le Séjour Café,40,Great French Bistro,Stylish French bistro in a central part of Nice. Highly competent cooking and very good front of house service. Generous portion sizes akin to a high quality British gastropub. Fresh menu that changes regularly.

Le Séjour Café,50,"Incredible, food, service, atmosphere and overall dining experience","Simply perfect, the entire evening and dining experience could not have been better. From the moment we walked in the staff were very welcoming and attentive, the dining room is small and elegant producing a lovely atmosphere. The food was incredible, the passion for food when hearing the menu from our host was a pleasure to hear and the food didn’t disappoint.    The end to end experience was perfect, make sure you book in advance and you will not be disappoint.    Merci a tout le personnel Le Sejour Cafe."

Le Séjour Café,50,Fine dining in a cozy restaurant which feels as if ints inside a friend's home. Reservations necessary.,"French dining at its finest. Reservations a must. It is so cozy , it feels as if being inside ones own home. Food is excellent"

Le Séjour Café,50,Best meal since lockdown,"Adored this meal. Had the double duck (fois gra and main duck) which was stunning. Wife had lobster risotto and scallops which she also loved. Service was delightful, wine was lovely and price wasn’t crazy. Too marks."

Le Séjour Café,50,Fantastic food,We walked in 30 min before they were closing and had a fantastic meal. Beef tartar and home made fois gras were superb.

Le Séjour Café,50,Superbe Samedi Soiree,"Forgive my basic French. This is where we took our good friends for their first fine meal in Nice. No one is perfect, but the gracious service, wonderful food, relaxing ambiance, even under the pressures of a full house on Saturday night, exemplifies the joy of real gastronomy without pretense. We always look forward to coming here, ever since the restaurant opened. Like everywhere else, the challenges of Covid have been endured. The plexiglass screens are gone now, there are fewer masks, and we all can celebrate the congenial bond between people, on both sides of the table, who appreciate the art of dining and savoring premium food, cooking and wine.    Perhaps the price point and informality are not quite ""fine dining"", but the quality, creativity and consistency mean full value and contentment for their patrons. Do reserve and enjoy this splendid venue."

Le Séjour Café,50,Oh my my,Wonderful formal/informal bridge of a physical plant - small - attentive cheerful service - made easy for English first language folks. Everything from the menu we ordered was superb. A real study of primo ingredients allowed to speak with expert minimalist manipulation. Wine list while ample is nonetheless succinct and quality laden. We Amongst the goodies the sardine crudo w greek yogurty cheese and parsley extract was genius.

Le Séjour Café,30,GOOD MENU,4.Very good menu. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. I ordered sea bass and fois gras. They were very very good. I can visit this restaurant.

Le Séjour Café,50,Great easy local dinner,"Had dinner here and you need to book in August as long time can get super busy, the fish and meat dishes we had were super fresh and the taste was so lovely."

Le Séjour Café,50,"Expensive but not blow the bank expensive,","I liked it so much I ate here twice. It seems hard to get a real french restaurant (most of them have pizza & pasta for tourists) but my hotel suggested here & it was perfect. The price suits the quality of the food - 2 glasses of wine, main & dessert will set you back around 60euro, add 15 if you're having a starter. The staff were lovely & accommodating & had good suggestions"

Le Séjour Café,50,Fantastic Food & Service!,"Really enjoyed this restaurant. Service was impeccable, and the food was extraordinary. The house-made foie gras was perhaps the best we’ve had. Lobster risotto was delicious and a fairly large portion. My fiancé had the local fish, which was fresh and bright. He also enjoyed the lemon soufflé very much. Thank you for a wonderful meal!"

Le Séjour Café,50,2 levels above the touristy restaurants in rue de la liberte!,"Very nice dinner and very friendly service. I think €€€€ is exaggerated price rating, €€-€€€ is more accurate - its same priced like the touristy restaurants in the crowded areas but plays 2 leagues higher.    So just walk a few meters away from overcrowded rue de la liberte and enjoy!"

Le Séjour Café,40,Nice dining experience,Fanatastic food and a nice atmosphere. The deserts and entreés were especialy brilliant with great local wine pairings.

Le Séjour Café,50,Perfection!,"We love this hidden gem, they truly understand the concept of the voice of the customer. The service is exceptional.. nothing is ever too much trouble, everyone is welcomed.. the food is magnificent. Every mouthful is a delight.. absolutely perfect!! The sisters xxx"

Raw,50,Diners will get a surprise,"Raw is an indigenous version of haute cuisine. Raw uses seasonal produce, for fresh flavours and textures. You do not choose from the menu, it's fixed menu only. Diners are in for a surprise."

Raw,50,Set menu is interesting,"Raw uses mainly locally-sourced ingredients to create Taiwan's own version of haute cuisine. Seasonal produce is used. Only set menus are available; diners may be surprised by what they are served, but it's interesting."

Raw,50,Haute cuisine with a Taiwan flavour,Raw uses locally-sourced ingredients to creates Taiwan's version of haute cuisine. Seasonal produce is used extensively. Prices are affordable. Only set menus are available; diners are in for a surprise.

Raw,50,AMAZING,This restaurant is very creative and uses a lot of special local ingredients. Taste was wonderful too. Need to book online in advance; most tables are for 4+ people.

Raw,50,Amazing,Amazing dinner experience at Raw. Impeccable attention to every detail by the staff. The food (summer menu) was quite creative and enjoyable. I did not love every single course but I appreciated the cohesiveness of the tasting menu. Fantastic wine pairings as well.

Raw,50,Excellect Dining Experience,The best Michelin-starred restaurant ever in Taiwan. The ingredients are great and the dishes are all very creative with very beautiful presentation. Don't miss the baked bread and desserts which are extremely delicious!

Raw,20,Booking process,"I have to say the booking process is really terrible !! They don't take you as a previous guest , they don't help , they don't answer your question ! Very bad booking service if you take this as Michelin star restaurant !!"

Raw,50,Lovely meal,"One of the best meals we ever had. Creative, bite size fusion tasting menu, friendly and professional staff. Love their non-alcoholic cocktail pairing. Pricey but worth it."

Raw,50,Awesome 2 stars French fusion restaurant,"Went there yesterday lunch with a group of 14 people, 15 courses set lunch super yummy! Except the soup which is average the rest of the dishes were great . Make sure you go with empty stomach. Friendly staff definitely worth trying!"

Raw,50,Absolute top,"Amazing dishes, with unusual flavors for Westerners although it’s probably not eastern as well. Waiters are super friendly and well informed, good background info on the dishes and wines. Interior of the place is smashing."

Raw,40,"Interesting food, good service",It was a birthday lunch with a friend and it was also the start of the summer menu. The dishes were fresh and tasted great. The bread was warm and yummy. Service was prompt and good. A visit to the toilet is a must!

Raw,50,Exciting food in a fun setting,"When we could only get in for an 11.30am start at lunch, we fully expected there would be two sittings, but that wasn’t the case. The spacings give the kitchen time to create extraordinary dishes that might hail from traditional French bistro classics but deliver so much more.    The French Onion Soup for example - this is a cheesy onion cream encased within a crisp golden orb and the croutons are provided by a crunchy baguette shaved over the top at the table. It’s sheer perfection.    We took the largest menu available which comes in at nine courses - there were no low points. The restaurant itself terms the cuisine ‘bistronomy’ and it’s an exciting and very enjoyable culinary development.    The restaurant has a dramatic timber bar and sculpture at the front, a quirky light installation and the restrooms are very out there! Service is brisk and some dishes can be whisked away because the server thinks you’ve finished. Make sure you keep on top of that, lest precious morsels be lost.    This is great value fine dining and, if you manage to score a reservation, worth crossing an ocean for."

Raw,50,Awesome,"To celebrate my friend’s birthday on 4 May, we reserved at 2000hrs, when we entered the restaurant, the interior design was awesome!!! The menu was preset, and there were total 10 dishes for the dinner! Food was delicious and you will get free birthday cake when you reserved 3 days in advance. Be reminded that it only accept reservations by email, no phone reservations."

Raw,40,nice but worst reservationhandling ever,this nicely designed restaurant was on our list since andre chiang told us about its opening. service was flawless and friendly. the food very nice and the ambiance rather relaxed and busy. we enjoyed it! reservationsystem and -handling is the worst we ever experienced compared to our visits to ca. 500 different toprestaurants all over the world...!

Raw,50,A Lovely Lunch at Raw...,"We were fortunate enough to reserve a table for lunch on my most recent visit to Taipei. Given that the restaurant was fully occupied, it was reasonable that RAW requested for a deposit upon confirmation of our booking.    We were attended to most warmly and professionally by Mr Oliver Wang from the moment my party of four stepped into the restaurant. The dining hall was energetic, the guests excited and relaxed, the staff attentive and united as a team.    Bilingual Mr Wang took us through our whole dining experience, with attention paid to the different dietary requirements amongst our small group. And of course, there was no better way to end our adventure than with a quick visit to the kitchen coupled with a polite conversation with Chef Alain.    Both the unique environment and ""bistronomy"" experience was well worth our time in Taipei. Looking forward to our next trip back!    Cheers Oliver!"

Raw,10,"Overrated, overpriced and hypocritical","My wife and I went to lunch at RAW with high expectations yesterday. This was our third attempt to make a booking on our three recent visits to Taipei. We failed to secure a booking on the first two occasions. With such popularity and the many great reviews on the internet, we naturally expected an exceptional dining experience. But we were hugely disappointed.    The dishes were mediocre st best. The few pieces of beef slices we had were tough and tasteless. The only thing that stood out was the presentation. And the lunch menu at NT2,680 plus 10% service charge was grossly overpriced. And at that price, they found it appropriate to charge you extra for the bread and coffee/tea! We are never miserly paying for good food and service, for as long as it is good value for money. At RAW, we definitely did not get what we paid for.    When they confirmed the booking, they asked whether we were celebrating any special occasion. We told them that it was my wife’s birthday. We expected a certain gesture by them to help my wife’s birthday celebration. But nothing of that sort happened. If you were not prepared to do anything, why did you take the trouble to ask in the first place?    RAW is hypocritical in their claim to be environmentally conscientious. To reduce the carbon output, they don’t import their drinking water from Europe, but use Nordaq FRESH system to produce their own sparkling and still water locally. But on the other hand they use high plastic content disposable napkins."

Raw,50,"Raw, Taipei","One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. We sat at the ""chef table"" nearest the kitchen, and had the wonderful opportunity to witness the youthful kitchen staff working together seamlessly to prepare the dishes for us. We were all amazed by the incredible speed at which they were working as well as the enthusiasm displayed - it was sheer theatre.    Btw, chef Andre Chiang is the mastermind behind Raw. As most foodies know, he won 2 Michelin stars for his restaurant Andre in Singapore.    Even before his Michelin crowning, we first had a taste of his spectacular culinary innovations at the Hong Kong Jockey Club a few years ago, and all of us were thoroughly impressed that evening.    A must-try restaurant for all food lovers."

Raw,40,Valentine’s Day Dinner,"They served set dinner with wine pairing on Valentine’s Day. We enjoyed the food except the rice burger thing that we found it very greasy and difficult to eat by hand. Although the food was plated like modern french cuisine, they tasted 100% Taiwanese. Most of the ingredients were sourced from different areas in Taiwan including some wine in the pairing. Staff were young but service was very good. Every course was explained in detail and the sommelier told us the background behind each wine.    Unfortunately, we did like the wine they selected except the lychee flavor sparkling wine that started the meal. One of the course was paired with a Taiwanese beer. It was not the first time we had wine pairing with beer between wine and we did not enjoy the arrangement. We thought it was more for the gimmick than taste.    After we had finished the main course, our waiter brought to our table a Staub Cast Iron Cocotte showing us the beef broth. He then served us a ladle of broth in our dirty plates with the used cutlery already placed on them. The presentation was bad and it was just for show only. We did not try the broth as it did not look appetizing in our dirty plates. We told our waiter afterwards that they should have served it with a small cup or bowl instead.    Overall it was a nice experience and the price was very reasonable comparing to those of the Michelin Star restaurants in Asia. Have a try if you could get a table."

Raw,50,As expected but cold,Great ambience and food but it was cold. Very cold. Diners on the next table wore overcoat and hats.  The food was excellent. Service was great and Harry was adorable with his style of service.  It wasn't over crowded in the layout and every consideration was made for a quirky yet professional experience. The Raw team have done an amazing job to please both the eyes and palette.  Highlights being the breads. Appetizer and soup dish and desert. Lows being the veal which I felt was undercooked and very fatty. Also no sugar or cream for the coffee course which after having banoffee pie and a sweet tooth is just for hand warming and non consumable.

Raw,20,3rd time unlucky,"This was my 3rd visit to RAW. The first 2 visits were exceptional, I don’t know what happened, but the standards has since fallen and where prices have gone up.    The most commendable dish was the tomato Gazpacho with sliced fruit. But as we arrived at the 2 main dishes ie the lobster & veal. The sauce was overpowering & far too salty for both mains. And the 2 dishes were prepared in Taiwanese style in totality. I was under the impression RAW is supposed to be a modern western restaurant with perhaps a hint of Taiwan. And not a full fledged Chinese Restaurant.    When dessert arrived again more disappointment. Too sweet !    My meal without wine cost NT$3080. For this price I expect to enjoy my meal.    It’s very rare that I give any reviews a rating below 3 stars. As I thoroughly research each place. I let my guard down as I had always been impressed till now.    Alan Leong  Singapore  Level 6"

Raw,40,"Better than expected, poor booking system","I have been trying to book the place for three years, the booking system is so stupid that it upsets a lot of people before they can experience the meal. I have been to many Michelin’s star restaurant and even the Andre in Singapore but the booking would never be so bad. Although I see some improvement, it is still unfriendly. Not sure why they cannot check other booking system to make improvement. I actually went there to book.    With regards to food, they use the local ingredients to make interesting tasting experience. I actually like the food and bread too. I am impressed by them using non-bottled water. The explanation of the food and the service are excellent too. The choice of wine is unusual, a lot of small vineyard that produce organic wine. I like how they support the small business.  Most dishes would have one or two pieces of deep fried food."

Raw,50,Stroke of genius,"I love the cuisine here ! Very proud to have a restaurant at this level here in chinese soil . 10 course menu here was delicious . From the amuse bouche until the desserts. The space looks very terroir , very artistic . Its more then a restaurant when you walk into this restaurant . Techniques , visual and taste found a balance . Brilliant."

Raw,30,A Restaurant For the Instagram Era.....,"This was our 3rd visit to RAW, Chef Andre Chiang's acclaimed farm to table restaurant in Taipei. Each time has been similar - a beautiful environment, courses which are extremely well plated and food which is essentially tasteless.    We started with a peanut creme hor d'oeuvres which was sweet and frankly overpowering as a starter.    A number of very ordinary courses followed - a gazpacho which which was bland; a rice hamburger (which doesn;t compare to the one at local the local MOS Burger fast food outlet); a strange and tasteless onion broth with a vegetable pastry served in a clam shell; a lobster dish in a diluted black bean sauce with very little seasoning; a interesting watercress wrapped scallop; mashed potatoes and caviar (ok),and a beef dish with squid that was almost too salty to eat.    The desert was fantastic - a banana ice cream tart - it was the only dish that had a variety of textures and a mixture of flavors.    All the dishes were well cooked and beautiful in their presentation - but little variety in textures, generally bland with very little seasoning.    And the winelist is a disaster - stocked with biodynamic wines that were very affordable - but terrible. We had a Aligote White Burgundy that was barely drinkable, followed by a red wine from Provence that was worse.    So, if your coming for lovely pictures to share with friends on Instagram - this is the right place. If your coming for food - you will be disappointed. Andre Chiang's RAW just doesn't deliver on taste or texture."

Raw,50,Top class food and service,"I had the pleasure of eating in Raw when visitin Taipei in October. It's one of the top 50 restaurants in Asia and the best in Taiwan. This gave me of course very high expectations. I must say it also delivered on the promise. Everything from the excellent reception, the hip and elegant interior to the innovative food and wine pairing was top notch. The menu i a contemporary fusion between French and Taiwanese food. Every dish was a delicious piece of art. The sommelier also paired every dish perfectly with rare French wines and they even had their own brewed mint scented lager! After the dinner I was invited to the kitchen to meet up and thank chef Alain Huang. A truly memorable and unique experience."

Raw,10,TERRIBLE BOOKING SYSTEM,"Nothing more I can say about this restaurant, I guess before Chef Andre can train up more talented chefs after closing restaurant Andre @ Singapore, the first step is to set up a FAIR booking system for all his restaurants... esp RAW."

Raw,50,MUST visit RAW !,"My 3rd visit: RAW makes it very easy to book online and super difficult to get a table coz of their popularity raved throughout the asian society, must book in advance. The organic timber structure which stands out in the restaurant which gives such aromatic fragrance blending in with the 10-course lunch, amazing and outstanding dining experience which one must visit!"

Seta,50,Unique experience at the Chef's table,"A unique dining experience at Chef's table in Sete. Been the only table in the kitchen, it was really fun to watch and hear the team in action. Everything is in such good order, no shouting, very clam, just like sitting in your own home. It is an open space however you have enough privacy, no one stares at you, only you there to watch. Chef Antonio greeted us, and the services from the team were excellent. When I say team, yes, we have been talking to three or four of them who were looking after us very well, they are super friendly and attentive. Highly recommended for couple or solo."

Seta,10,".. sorry, you need to do better!","This was by far one of my worst experiences ever at a Michelin star restaurant. The staff was not very kind, not at all welcoming and the food left much to be desired. Furthermore, the wines were excellent- the pours were just about a sip each. For the price, we could have bought a couple bottles of very fine wine. I am sorry but cannot recommend this restaurant."

Seta,50,Seta Delivers!,"Stellar experience at Seta! While visiting Italy I knew I wanted to try one of the many Michelin star restaurants it has to offer, and I’m glad I chose Seta. From beginning to end, the experience was magical! Every bite was both interesting and delicious. The staff executed our meal flawlessly and even provided a special treat to celebrate my wife’s birthday! Although expensive it was well worth it!"

Seta,50,What a Restaurant,This a Fantastic Restaurant and should have 3 stars not 2 a Michelin Travesty .Also very good for Vegetarians and the Apple Desert an absolute must!

Seta,50,3-Star Experience,"It was an amazing experience! Tried the tasting menu and every piece was delightful. We loved the wine pairings as well, but it could be better i suppose. Definetely worth trying."

Seta,50,Our first lunch in Milan ❤️,"We haven’t really had the chance to try local traditional Italian food in Milan ""yet"" .🤷🏻‍♀️ Our first day was a memorable lunch at 2 michelin-starred restaurant Seta at Mandarin Oriental. It was great, lots of complimentary amuse bouche which, made sense in preparing us for the main lunch. Service was excellent, however, we came in around 2ish and by 3:30ish, the restaurant was empty, including our original servers. Everyone dissappeared after the cheese course without saying anything to us (which usually most fine dine place would do especially our main server going for a break). So we just find that the journey dining at Seta was somewhat incomplete.    Overall Chef Antonio Guida did an magnificent job in creating each plate, not only was his presentation was like piece of art but it was delicate and savoury. Again, it made sense. Many chefs tried so hard to make their own cooking ""fusion"" but being overly creative can make their customers tastebuds into the journey of “confusion”. 😂🤣 Luckily, that wasn’t the case here with Chef Antonio Guida."

Seta,50,FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS,"The title of this review is pretty conclusive!    We absolutely loved our evening at the Chef's Table.  I won't spoil the surprise of the food, but each course was exceptional, some simple yet delicious and others more complex & well thought out.    Service was fantastic, we were made to feel welcome, our glasses were never empty & staff were all knowledgeable about what they were serving.    We wouldn't hesitate to return here."

Seta,50,"Delightful, exquisite",What a delightful meal at the table’s chef. Exquisite flavors! A 3 stars michelin in the making. Bravo chef Antonio and team!

Seta,40,If you love creativity,"This 2-Michelin-star restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental Milan with modern, romantic ambiance. I went for the Seta’s tasting menu which was a bit too creative for my taste. Being said, every dish was carefully crafted with the highest attention. If I am back, I would go for à la carte with the below 2 dishes (pictured), which were impressive.    Blue Lobster: this Brittany gem was slightly undercooked to expose the slight crunch and sweetness of the meat while still preserving expected lobster flesh texture. Well done.    Risotto: who can do risotto better than the Italians? However, the raspberry cream was the star for providing an interesting kick to the dish."

Seta,50,Birthday dinner,"Lovely restaurant and pleasant staff! I went alone for my birthday and my bill was a little under €200 just to manage your expectations. I had starters, main course and desert. You must try the blue lobster to complete the experience! It was soo good. I love the atmosphere and would definitely go back!"

Seta,20,Worst dinner of our 3 week Italy trip. Very disappointing service and overly briny food.,"Unquestionably the most disappointing dinner of our entire 25th anniversary trip to Italy was at 2* Seta (Italian for Silk) at the Mandarin Oriental Milan on our first night.    It’s a beautiful courtyard setting, but the service was downright unworthy of even a single Michelin star. After getting water, it was about 45 minutes before we saw our first food. I had to ask for and complain to the manager, but all I got were empty platitudes. Apparently, while I was in the restroom later during the meal, the manager apologized to my husband and indicated they were short staffed — but still offered no service recovery whatsoever. Most unimpressive.    We might have been able to overlook the service faux paux had the meal been better — but way too many courses had the same off-putting briny flavor profile. And I normally love briny. It seemed that the kitchen was as short staffed as the service team. Presentations were nice, but it all was more pomp than circumstance. There was no course that really impressed us. Two stars? I think not.    I haven’t been this negative toward a 2* restaurant since 2* Commis in Oakland — but even that had at least nice food and great service.    We would never return."

Seta,50,Antonio Guida is a resourceful Chef who deserves 3 stars Micheline,"I am a regular customer at Mandarin Oriental not only in Milan. The Staff is excellent as always, but this review is about Seta Restaurant Chef Antonio Guida.    We chose via della Seta degustation menu, which is an amazing journey trough perfectly matched flavors. Chef Guida came to welcome us and I expressed my deep appreciation for his cuisine with just one comment about the lobster plate, which, according to my personal taste had a too uniform flavor.    Chef Guida surprised me with the next plate which was prepared just for me: a surprise.  I cannot describe in words how that plate was amazing: the pungent taste of the sea urchin ice cream, combined with other ingredients like fish tartare and sea cream. The opposite but complementary flavors were creative and lively notes in my mouth, as if the sea itself were speaking to me. I have never tried anything so artistic and perfect.    For me there are no doubts that Chef Guida deserves the third star Michelin, he has perfect mastery of ingredients and know how to create a masterpiece.    Thank you Chef Guida for this unexpected surprise and for your humble personality.    Stefano Magni"

Seta,50,Nice Italian dishes with some asian fusion,We had dinner there and tried the seta tasting menu. Every dish was very balanced and cooked to perfection. We especially loved the red prawn spaghetti with the radish cream. The staff were lovely and their wine pairing suggestion was excellent. A tad expensive compared to others in town but well worth the money!

Seta,50,Excellent Flavours,"My husband and I had a really lovely meal here. We often do tasting menus as we like trying new things and Seta didn't disappoint! We arrived early and had n aperitif in the bar. The bar is gorgeous and drinks and snacks were really tasty, a good taste of what was to come. Our waiters and sommelier were simply wonderful and clearly very passionate about what they do! Their English was absolutely fantastic. We do speak some Italian but not enough to explain a tasting menu and we had some great conversations with them about the food and wine.  The food was divine! Every plate was so well balanced, and honestly I would have loved to have the whole menu again if I wasn't completely stuffed! The wine pairing was brilliant as well and really added to the dishes.  This was the first night on our gastronomic road trip of Emilia Romagna and we couldn't have made a better start. Thank you all the chefs and staff at Seta!"

Seta,40,Very good not excellent,"I’m still trying to decide if I really enjoyed the dinner here or not.    The occasion was the 30th birthday of my fiancée. I was looking forward having heard and read really good opinions on the restaurant.    The restaurant:    The garden court is really beautiful, we almost forget to be in the center of Milan. Its very quite and the design is just amazing.    The Service:  Here my doubt start a bit. I think for a two stars Michelin the service it’s not up to standard. I wrote and been to one star restaurant with a much higher quality service. I had reserved a surprise cake and the commis asked to my fiancé for desserts making us to have a double dessert…    The food:    Lets start saying that three menus were impressive, just i thought that some plate were out of place for the season and the combination in two menus of some dishes were not my personal favorite. Indeed we had a la carte dinner and we liked the proposal.    The day after and still now i think the experience it’s not of a two stars"

Seta,40,Nice!!,We were so looking forward to our Michelin starred restaurant as this was requested to book via our hotel concierge who did not book in good time despite our asking- however we had to sit inside when the real ambiance was outside in the courtyard- given the heat - it was not as nice sitting inside -however the staff were very helpful and the food was great- my favourite was the pasta dish but it was not outstanding to be memorable- the working kitchens were visible if sitting in the courtyard and we could have been anywhere- overall food was good and as expected for a Michelin restaurant of this calibre!!

Seta,10,Such a Disappointment of Inconsiderate Management,"My husband and I brought our family to Italy after years of postponing due to Covid. We made a reservation at Seta for the two of us one night during our stay and we were looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the day before our reservation one of our three daughters became ill with Covid. As if it wasn't enough to deal with a family member getting Covid during our trip, when I tried to call and cancel our reservation, I waited for several minutes and then was hung up on while waiting.  To add even more insult to injury, we were charged $200 USD for not showing up. I provided documentation of the attempted call and the management refused to honor our request for a refund.  If they are so desperate for funds, they should try investing their money rather than robbing from people in a vulnerable situation."

Seta,50,Elegant and delicious,Located on a nice terrace at the Mandarin Oriental. We’d just arrived in town and it was a great start. We were treated to a very good three course tasting with wine pairings. The menu items and the pairings ere excellent and generous. Service was attentive and friendly. The chicken was an excellent surprise. I also recommend the red mullet.

Seta,50,World Class Dining,"We booked Seta well in advance to visiting Milan from Australia and it did not disappoint our expectations.  Be sure to not go with a full stomach as they will serve a fair amount.  If you are looking for a FINE fine dining experience with world class service and a beautiful outdoor courtyard seating then this may just be a place for you. However, I would highly recommend visiting the menu online prior to booking as this restaurant is not for each and everyone.  The presentation of each dish is served immaculately on Fornasetti porcelain and taste divine.  It is an experience to share with somebody special."

Seta,50,Amazing food with impeccable service!,Daring combinations of textures and flavors with unique presentations. Every dish was a wonderful surprise cook to perfection.

Seta,40,Excellent food but don’t do the wine pairing,Food and service excellent however the wine pairing was a disappointment. We are used to having excellent wines when choosing the pairing option and this was definitely not the case here. If I could choose again I would rather have chosen my own wine

Seta,50,It's A-OK for the chef Antonio Guida his executive sous chef Federico Dell'omarino and his pastry chef Nicolo Di Lena.,"We had an awesome 33 wedding anniversary at the chef table.Everybody was so involve and pretty cool like we were a part of this amazing team.  What a rewarding and enriching night it was to spend a few hours in the kitchen with such talented and imaginative people.  The presentation and the flavors of the dishes were a real vibration:  -The ostriche(oyster) con patate e salsa allo champagne unexpected surprise .  -The conchiglie(pasta) al tandoori,aglio nero ed infuso di patata arrosto a real gift.  -L'anguilla al vino rosso con fegato e salsa al rosmarino a classic master piece from the italian food.  The desserts were amazing and all the chocolate degustation.  Please,say to the pastry chef that's you love it's gold chocolate so you can taste it again.  Cheers."

Seta,50,One of the best restaurant we experienced in Italy,"Visited the restaurant with my son and we had their tasting menu. It was absolutely amazing with none of the fluff associated with most Michelin starred restaurant. The pace was good too, not too long and the service were absolutely on point. Will be back again."

Seta,50,The best culinary experience of my life,"When I tell you this was the best meal/experience I’ve ever had I’d still be understating it. I had the privilege of sitting at the chefs table and spending the evening with Antonio, Federico, and the amazing staff at Seta. I was traveling alone and the team made me feel so welcomed, I felt like I’d known them for years. The food was absolutely unreal and the creativity behind each dish is what really made this meal incredible. I would come back to Milan just to dine here.    Grazie davvero per tutto!!!"

Seta,50,An unforgettable evening,"Unbelievable evening!  Incredible plates, attention and details were perfectly perfect. Definitely a must to try if you wanna please yourself with a fantastic and high level cuisine. The staff was always super careful to satisfy all your needs."

Seta,50,Expectations exceeded!,"Luckily the concierge from MO Milan got us the table, everything that followed has been a treat.    From the moment we arrived at the restaurant we didn’t miss a single thing. The team, the food and the fantastic recommendations in regards to the wine were on the spot. Can only recommend to anyone looking for an outstanding experience!"

Seta,40,Very good,"We had a delicious celebratory lunch here. The food is very good, we’ll cooked and inventive and service is excellent. If you want a formal experience with food to match, Seta is a excellent choice."

Seta,50,Couldn't have been a better experience,"We dined at the chef's table in the kitchen and Chef Guida visited our table frequently, asked our opinions and was perfect company. The food was stunningly presented, creative and outstanding. A truly magical evening."

Seta,10,Wrong,"I chose the most expensive tasting menu, the food was bad, the waiters were in a hurry and the wine was not tasty. I do not recommend."

Melisse,50,Spectacular! Perhaps my new favorite in LA,"Our Los Angeles anniversary weekend’s final dinner at 2* Melisse in Santa Monica was absolute perfection. What an amazing meal. I can’t believe it’s taken us this long to try! We loved almost every single course, and too many to count were mind blowingly good. The wine pairings — unusually both white and red for every course or group of courses — were both avant-garde in approach and yet completely fulfilling and delightful. Every wine pairing was fantastic, and yet the two wine approach let us enjoy elements we otherwise might have missed. I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.    The team was as effortlessly entertaining as they were professional. Service was fantastic — with the single caveat of the early arrival bar seating being a bit oddly done. We adored the sommelier and a few servers, and really enjoyed getting to know them a bit better as much as the food and wine.    We absolutely loved it. Way better for us than wildly overrated Providence. We definitely will return."

Melisse,10,"TERRIBLE! $1500 for 4, SERVICE HORRIBLE, HEATER BROKEN, only outdoors!","Horrible experience. They have prices of 5 star restaurant but not worth even 1 star.  1) Setting is in parking lot next to ugly apartment building. No charm, no class!  2) Currently only outdoors tables, very cold at night.  3) Charge $35/person cancellation so you go even on cold night.  4) Only 1 heater per table, have no extra heaters. Ours didn't work, were freezing all night.  5) Online menu (which had my favorite veggie dish) is different from the one at the restaurant, (which didn't). Menu was confusing, poorly explained.  6) We are vegetarian and they had told me on phone they had vegetarian menu. Not true, they only had one dish of pasta or risotto . That's it.  7) If 1 person wants 4 course menu, then the whole table is forced to order 4 courses.  8) They brought me my first 2 courses at same time. When I asked them to keep one warm, they told me to keep it at the table.  9) Food was ok but not hot and definitely not worth the price.  10) Service was HORRIBLE! Waiters were standing at entrance, chatting with each other, ignoring us. Spent my Birthday evening freezing and frustrated by not getting help.  11) The bill was $1500, that's about 4x of what we had expected when we decided to go there! Surcharges here and there that had not been explained when we ordered. We were shocked. It was MOST DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT. It wasn't worth $100.  12) Talked to the manager about it, she was SUPER RUDE. Said our heater didn't work, they only have 1 heater per table and have no extra. She didn't care, didn't want to hear my complaint, didn't offer anything. We've been to a lot of excellent restaurants and this definitely isn't one of them.  13) At those prices you must have good service. Ambience. Working and extra heaters. WE'LL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!"

Melisse,50,Take put menu,The food is superb and the take out dinners are fabulous and worth every penny ( or $$$$). Easy to heat up at home .

Melisse,10,Don't eat there,"I am writing to alert you to never go to their restaurant. We went there at 6pm with the understanding that nothing could be guaranteed as far as a booth or their seating.; When we arrive, we saw the restaurant was empty and requested a booth. What we were told was they weren’t available yet there were patrons sitting at booth (2 to the booth). After questing the booth, the overly sensitive maitre d went to the owner and complained that we weren’t happy – he came out and snapped his fingers saying we should leave because we were being abusive to his staff; which we were more than happy to do. the restaurant is overpriced and the way we were treated was indefensible – especially from the snapping finger owner – The web site says they cannot guarantee any requests yet when we went there a couple (2) people were sitting at a booth. When we mentioned that the restaurant was empty and we wanted to have a booth; we were ceremoniously dismissed – This type of customer service is not expected from an over price restaurant – We have lived on Santa Monica for over 40+ year and can only say that this is indicative of the type of classless restaurant ownership that is unbecoming of Santa Monica – If you visit Santa Monica avoid this pace at all costs – It is pretentious and lacks any class due to a high end restaurant . The place isn’t worth you time or money."

Melisse,50,Ok. Melisse. Food is extraordinary.,"Ok. Melisse. Food is extraordinary. Service was perfect: Charming, funny and fully informational. What’s not to like? Well, a couple of things IMO. First, price. We had the tasting menu. With the wine pairings. 8 courses. Give or take a few parenthetical courses. $800+ per person with tip. Too much, IMO. I’m never a fan of pay first. Something wrong about that when we’re talking about this kind of quality and service. But kinda worth it. All of the preliminary ‘courses’ were sublime. The Waygu Tartare beggar’s purse w caviar, the Buri were wonderful. The uni cromesquis was unreal. The UFO oyster was great though I still think Wellfleet Oysters are sweeter. The Leek Chanawanmushu, Uni scrambled Egg and OsetraCaviar were unbelievably good. They followed that with Chesnut soup with whipped black truffle which was so good I was tempted to beg for seconds. The Hakkaido Scallop with warmed garlic,Tokyo Negi and Black Trumpets, the spiny lobster were reasons to contemplate another pass at begging for seconds. Kinmedai Sunchoke, porcini,w spinach was excellent. The quail, the lamb and the waygu were also excellent though at this point though by this point, while I wasnt full, I was starting to feel like I’d had enough. Not too much for dessert which was also extraordinary.Pinapple guava, passion fruit and Vanilla yogurt with a sensational wine ‘pairing’ of Galant de abbesses & 2018 Bugey Rose. The Wine pairings throughout this great meal went a long way towards earning that big price tag. Worth it? Yes. A really memorable and fine meal. All of the servers and the chef were doing everything they could to make sure we were happy campers. They succeeded!"

Melisse,50,"Excellent all around, Michelin Stars (2)","We had dinner here on 2/9/19. We were seated timely, the food was superb, and service excellent. The menu that night was prefix. We chose the 4 course because 7 or 10 sounded like a lot of food. The dinner lasts a long time...about 2 1/2 hours for ours. The only problem I had was that it was too filling...I just can't eat that much food anymore and I ended up all night with an upset stomach. I told my husband...no more prefix, I just can't handle it. It is a very special place, and very expensive. Check the menu before going so you know if you can afford it. Our bill was around $1000 for four."

Melisse,50,Special Occasions,"Honestly , I did not want to go BUT happily surprised with excellent service from start to finish great presentations of each dish and excellent experience for all . Four course is plenty and did not rush through our meal. Don’t care for 3% added to bill for health insurance but can tell them remove from bill. Definitely go back for special evenings."

Melisse,50,Joel’s Special Occasion Restaurant,"As locals, we enjoy dining at Melisse, Joel’s Special Occasion Restaurant, several times each year. As arguably Santa Monica’s Top gourmet restaurant, it’s reserved for those special times that we want to celebrate. Michelin starred, so pricing is commensurate. Enjoy that special occasion!"

Acquerello,10,RUDE,"My husband made a reservation for our family to have a special dinner here to celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary. He wrote that our reservation time was at 6:00 PM, when it was actually at 5:30 PM. Our daughter is T1 diabetic and was having an emergency low blood sugar. We arrived around 15 minutes late and we were scolded by the hostess. We were told another table was booked behind us and that we basically did NOT need to take our time. I am a world-wide traveler and have never been made to feel so humiliated. As a family business owner, this type of treatment sickens me and we will NEVER give money to this business again. Thanks for ruining our anniversary."

Acquerello,40,Birthday Dinner,"I really wanted to go back to one of the 3 Michelin Star restaurants here in the Bay to celebrate my birthday, unfortunately, all were fully booked despite that I have tried to book 2 months in advance. Been to all 3 Michelin stars in the Bay Area so no big deal. We ended up here which was not a bad choice. This is our 2nd visit and our first experience was excellent 5 years ago.    To start with, the place has not changed much. Still looking a bit plain inside, but the service is still impeccably excellent. Food was good, but 5 years ago, it was excellent (I also reviewed).    Food presentation was very good. Taste wise, almost every dish was good except the main dish - lamb. It looked so good, unfortunately, it was too tangy and too salty for our taste.    In the middle of our last dish, our waiter delivered my supposedly complimentary birthday cake. Instead, he made a mistake and delivered an anniversary cake which was supposed to be for the other table. I didn’t bother telling him as not to embarrass him. Afterwards, I saw him delivered my birthday cake to the other table which the wife uttered “It’s not my birthday”. I was rather disappointed that two reckless mistakes happened. Please double check and pay more close attention where to send the birthday cake, anniversary cake, etc. After all, these important celebrations are some of the reasons why such as myself dine here."

Acquerello,10,Disappointing Evening,"I'm pretty shocked to be writing this review and even more saddened I was treated so poorly I will never dine at Acquerello again. My first experience was about 10 years ago, and I was turned away as I was dressed too casually. I was mortified and embarrassed and since then (I've been a half dozen times) I make sure to follow their formal dress code. The night before my reservation this week I was even called to emphasize the dress code--and I appreciated that touch, knowing I was in for a special evening. So I was literally shocked when the hostess seated a man in a t-shirt in front of me during my meal. I tried to follow up with one of the owners the next day. First I was told I was not allowed to speak to an owner. Then I was told ""it's 2022. We don't follow a strict dress code anymore."" Well, maybe you could have told me that the night before when I was called and told the opposite.  Dinner for two was $900 and I was seated next to someone who could have just as easily be eating at McDonald's. You used to go to Acquerello for the experience or else why bother? A picture is worth 1,000 words. I was told I wasn't allowed to speak to an owner. Perhaps the owners read reviews."

Acquerello,50,Maintaining San Francisco's Legacy of a Destination of Excellence,"I am delighted to report that Acquerello has not been part of a trend of rapidly declining service standards that seems to have accelerated and been used as an excuse in the time of Covid.    Instead, Acquerello may be one of the last great dining institutions in a city that is known to set a worldwide standard for outstanding food.    The dining room itself is meticulously maintained and is absolutely lovely- beautiful fresh flower arrangements, wonderful furnishings, well-pressed linens, beautiful china, and well-spaced tables. Well-spaced tables seem to have gone by the wayside as a standard for a first-class restaurant. Fortunately, Acquerello has maintained this standard. This alone allows for the ability to have a conversation at your table without shouting and is a great feature during Covid. Did I mention they have linen?!    With the leadership of the amazing Isabella Paterlini, the service is absolutely superb. Friendly, warm, elegant, and unobtrusive. The choreography is a pleasure to observe. The team that made it happen for our evening was exceptional- Kevin Lee as General Manager was in the dining room throughout working in tandem with a superb group of people. Even the busser had an elegance that rivaled a food server in most upscale restaurants. Davide who presided over our table was also especially charming and had an exceptional knowledge of the extensive dishes that were presented during our meal. The Sommelier had a lyrical narrative for the wines he was serving as well. All of them truly masters of their craft.    One might think this dining room would only appeal to older diners, but I saw a diverse mix of young diners in their twenties to older folks- all of whom looked like they were truly enjoying their experience. The service here made all of us feel special and well cared for.    There are so many reviews about how excellent the food is, and they are correct. Every morsel of food was treated masterfully, and nothing was an after-thought. The pasta, the proteins, the cheeses, the pastries- all amazing and beautifully presented. They have artists in the kitchen!    Thank you for an amazing meal and an amazing experience."

Acquerello,50,Terrific meal,First off the staff were amazing. Some of the best service I've had anywhere. The atmosphere was warm yet stylish. I had the five course there was nothing I didn't like. The Almond cake was so yummy and I don't normally go for lemon or almond flavors. I will be back. Oh and no sloppy men dining in tee shirts!

Acquerello,50,We attended a spectacular dinner party at Acquerello,We attended a spectacular dinner party at Acquerello. This was an 80th birthday dinner party. It started with wine and appetizers for an hour and then an amazing 6 course dinner. It was very sophisticated and complex. The food was very delicious. It was served very professionally. The dinner party lasted about 4 hours and it was wonderful. The restaurant is very beautiful. It is well located near Union Square.

Acquerello,50,"Anniversary Dinner, Over the Top!","From the moment my wife and I entered Acquerello we were treated like royalty. We were led to a table that was set up with a special anniversary card and printed menus outlining the culinary adventure we about tp partake in. My wife and I selected ""A Tasting of Vegetables"" set menu with Wine Pairing. Each course was an exquisitely prepared visual masterpiece presented in a way that built excitement for the upcoming explosion of flavors awaiting us. Needless to say we enjoyed ourselves. The dinner was expensive but the overall food and experience was worth it."

Acquerello,50,Exceptional Italian Fine Dining Experience!!,"A truly exceptional meal!! This restaurant defines elegant and fine dining while not sacrificing attentive and professional service. But let’s face it you go to a 2* Michelin restaurant for the food and Acquerello doesn’t disappoint with its fresh, tasty, and elevated take on Italian cuisine. The pairing of Italian wines was inspired. While there are plenty of standouts in the seasonal tasting menu, the fish carpaccio and the ridge pasta with truffle and Marsala were sublime. A definite highlight of San Francisco’s foodie scene."

Acquerello,30,A bit too stuffy,Not our kind of restaurant. Too quite and large tables so we felt like we had to talk loud to chat. Music was 1980s muzac and overly saxophonie. The food was ok. Service was exceptional. All in all overpriced for the experience. Needs to modernize.

Acquerello,50,Really good dinner,"The experience was fantastic from beginning to end! Marco , John Paulo gave is excellent service. And the food was so delicious!"

Acquerello,50,Excellent Takeout for the plague days,"Picked up a meal kit for 2 last night. Utterly delicious, and while not cheap, quite a bargain considering the quality of the food (2 Michelin stars are well deserved). Each dish did very well with reheating. Nothing was dried out or tired. Flavors and balance were perfect across the board. I very strongly recommend giving it a try."

Acquerello,20,Tasteless service and food,"Very disappointed in this restaurant given it’s apparent reputation in the city. Waited too long for someone to come to the table initially. Main server was either a robot or Dragon Lady; militaristic and very cold.    The parm cheese tower with foam was quite good but overpowered by truffle salt.    Risotto was ok but the meat in the middle was like a hockey puck. Pasta uneventful. The big disappointment was the mains. The duck and lamb has absolutely no flavor. The lamb was overpowered by licorice.    Desserts also lacking flavor.    The owner was there and we asked him if he was the owner. He said yes and walked off.    An interesting observation-the flower arrangements were well past their time, many of the blooms has already been picked. Financial issues?    Hospitality, food and service; the three components of restaurants, all lacking."

Acquerello,20,Disappointing cuisine & very poor food value,"Using SOP foodie scale 0 to 5 rating    Ambience = 4, compelling decor with beautiful plates and presentations    Service = 1.5, militaristic, cold and irregular service. Think greasy spoon truck stop lunch counter. Owner oddly robotic. Request for kitchen tour deflected and ignored.    Cuisine = 2, very nice presentations, off putting odors beyond aggressive sauces, very low flavor in lamb and duck entrees and excessive salt on several course (read excessive). Desserts were the best course.    Wine = 4, amazing wine list and knowledgeable wine steward. No hard liquor license thus no bar, could not make a French 75.    Very poor food value and profoundly disappointing. Eat somewhere else."

Acquerello,50,Finally a restaurant which deserves their Michelin star,I'm pretty picky for giving 5 stars to a restaurant unless I truly have a unique experience and Acquerello is one of the best restaurant in the Bay Area. High quality service and amazing food.

Acquerello,50,Italian with a modern twist,"We dined here to celebrate my birthday on a trip to SF. We chose Acquerello because we wanted to try a Michelin starred restaurant on our trip. We were not disappointed! Our greeting was warm and friendly. We were shown to our table and offered black napkins. Water choices were shared and soon we had a lovely amuse bouche or two while we perused the menu. The food is Italian with a modern twist. There is the option of the Chef’s surprise menu, which on this night featured truffles. The second option is your choice of three, four or five course prix fixe menus. We chose the three course and found it to be plenty of food. The wine list is extensive and specializes in our favorite, Italian wines. The highlight for us was talking with the very knowledgeable Sommelier and appreciated the information he shared with us. He made perfect recommendations to go with our food and even gave us a sip before pouring to make sure we liked it. Extra points for feigning interest is our many Italian wine stories! : )    The service is very professional but also warm and friendly. The breads were tasty as was the house made butter with lava salt. Desserts were incredible as was the strawberry, lemony meringue birthday treat!    Overall Acquerello was everything we had hoped for in this lovely restaurant."

Acquerello,50,Excellent Birthday Dinner,"Had the most perfect birthday dinner in this restaurant. The location and ambience is very chic and cosy in the same time. The service is absolutely immaculate. Every staff member very professional yet friendly, welcoming and caring. The attention to detail is extremely impressive and you really get fascinated by how smooth the service is being ran. The food has been mind-blowing. We went for the seasonal truffle tasting menu and every dish came to perfection. It has been a wonderful experience and journey through the menu. My only wish is to be able to try all the desserts and petit fours, however the food was so good that I had no space left for this. Although the kind staff prepared a beautiful take away box with my favourite chocolates and home made biscotti. A dinner to remember for a long time and a place I would love to come back to one day."

Acquerello,20,Very Disappointing NYE Dinner,"Disappointing experience at NYE dinner. We got the wine tasting menu but they removed wine glasses from our table because they could not bother to make room to fit them all in. Everybody working at the restaurant - from servers to bussers to greeters seemed very stressed, which totally ruined the experience. The NYE ambiance was a total failure with cheap balloons used for decoration and nothing else. Meat was brought completely raw without even asking us for our preference which caused delays in the tasting menu and threw our schedule off track. We were virtually kicked out to the curb literally five minutes to midnight without so much as a new year's greeting. We were also charged extra for some menu items without being advised - about a hundred extra on what is already a thousand dollar plus meal. Will not be visiting again, huge letdown really. Cannot recommend the place to anyone on good conscience."

Acquerello,50,Simply a perfect meal.,Took my parents here to celebrate my father’s birthday. The service was excellent from start to finish. Good ambience and intimate setting.    The food along with the chef’s surprises were delicious. Presentation was excellent. We all had a great time and will definitely return.    Would highly recommend the ridged pasta with faux foie gras and black truffle.    Words cannot describe how nice this evening was. You must try for yourself and will definitely not regret it.    Well worth its 2 Michelin stars.

Acquerello,50,Impressive,"Impeccable service, excellent food and wine pairings, in a city of great restaurants, they have absolutely made a statement about excellent Italian food"

Acquerello,50,Unbelievable ✨,"Wow! This was such a wonderful experience! The ambiance was perfect, the waiters were remarkable, the pairings of wine fit perfectly and the food was superb! Please go here if you are in the San Fran area and want to get wined and dined with excellence ✨"

Acquerello,50,Fantastic Italian food!,"I can honestly say that this restaurant is deserving of the Michelin stars - everything about the dinner was pretty perfect. Starting with the welcome - I really like it when a restaurant honors the reservation and doesn't make you wait around for a table. The servers were on top of everything - the moment you needed something, they were there. It was pretty clear that everyone worked as a team! Food was fantastic - I enjoyed every course - however, the star of the show was definitely the butterscotch semifreddo dessert - incredibly well done. Kudos to the chef and pastry chef for an outstanding dinner!"

Acquerello,50,Nice experience,"Everything was perfect from the amuse-bouche to the dessert, especially the apricot pana cotta, and the passion fruit chocolat lollypop!! the service was great, waiters are really nice and the dinning room is original. I would highly recommend this restaurant!!!"

Acquerello,50,Perfect Anniversary Dinner,"Close to our Fairmount hotel on Nob Hill for our anniversary dinner. Elegant restaurant.  The professional staff gave us exquisite service and attention. They made our celebration so memorable. The food is fabulous and their Italian wine list is great. If you would like a very special dining experience with old world charm and amazing food, this is a must to dine here."

Acquerello,50,A Divine Experience,"An air of hushed elegance pervades Acquerello, aptly like walking into a place of worship, except here the divine is exquisite food. The waitstaff is polished and professional, and it doesn’t hurt that the Italian waiters are so handsome and charming.    The food is exquisite, with each course (we did four) so well thought-out and so beautifully-presented. I started with a simple green salad; the greens themselves so fresh and tasty that the dressing seemed almost an afterthought. My next course was a mushroom risotto, served in a small white bowl. The mushrooms were small and whole; no mushroom pieces here! It was exquisite in taste and design. My third course was the Williamette Valley lamb, with polenta, Chanterelle mushrooms, corn and pickled ramps. The two small loins of lamb were perfectly pink and tender and oh-so-tasty. For a final course, I chose the cheese. The cheese cart is amazing as is the description of each cheese. It made for a hard choice. We accompanied our delicious food by a rich, dry Amarone. Our dinner lasted almost three hours. Acquerello is a divine experience."

Acquerello,50,Typical Northitalian restaurant,"Very good service, great typical Italian Pizza and Pasta, delicious. Reasonable prices. Very nice interior."

Acquerello,50,"A really nice, adult-focused evening","The food is excellent, the setting is quiet, the service unhurried (but I mean that in a very good way!). A perfect evening for two of us to enjoy and be able to talk."

Acquerello,40,Delightful,"The ambiance is soothing, the decor is lovely and the staff charmingly professional-very old school, the right amount of attentiveness without being intrusive!    We arrived early and they were ready for us, seated immediately for cocktails.    Let me emphasize, the food is very, very good and the presentation absolutely beautiful, Perhaps-not-off-the-chart amazing.    The environment is formal, suit and jacket, and its expensive. That being said, it will be a memorable experience."

Acquerello,50,"Once again, an incredible dinner in all aspects","Recently had the pleasure of being part of a business dinner with a fairly large group at Acquerello.    The location is easy to find, and there are parking options nearby, including right across the street.    We had their large private room. We were early, but they were ready, taking us in, getting drinks going, and starting the appetizers that were pre arranged.    We had a pre set menu, although several of the servings we had choices on.    First off let me emphasize the food is incredible here. Every dish, was a true pleasure. From the presentation, to the flavor, freshness, you name it. Then add the impeccable service, our waiter was exceptional. And for each serving, they served the entire group at once. A small army of staff rolled into the room and served us all at the same time. The same for picking up the dishes.    One of the appetizers that I found exceptional was a seaweed chip with some items on it. Fantastic.....    And then the amazing item for the night was their Ridged Pasta with faux “foie gras “ with black truffle and Marsala. This was amazing. I used some of my bread to make sure not a single drop of the sauce was wasted.    I also enjoyed the chickpea salad and the rabbit culurgiones.    Simply an incredible meal.    The environment is rather formal, with a suit jacket suggested.    And it’s rather expensive.... but it was a memorable experience.    Enjoy!"

Acquerello,50,First Class Restaurant,"Visiting San Francisco , my wife and I were hosted by our son ( a SF resident ) for a special evening out , and we were most impressed by this fine restaurant . The ambiance was soothing , the service friendly , efficient and professional , and the food truly exceptional : every dish a new taste sensation . Now with two Michelin stars , this restaurant has to be one of the best in the city . And yes of course it is expensive , but without any doubt worth the money . Truly a memorable dining experience ."

Acquerello,50,Hidden Gem,"Acquerello wasn’t what I expected it would be like, considering I had walked passed it numerous times. It was off a not so nice part of Polk Street and hidden away. Once we entered, it was like another world. The restaurant was upscale and dark, like REALLY dark. The courses were small, but eloquently prepared and the flavors were perfect. The wine pairings were great. The most impressive part of our experience was the service. With so few tables, there were a surprising number of wait staff. Ours stood away from our table to give us privacy, but was always aware if we needed something. Acquerello taught me what great service really is! I give it 5 stars for sure! The only downside is it is pretty pricey and you can’t go there hungry since the portions aren’t very large. But you will 100% feel special while you’re there and be given the utmost care in food prep and service!"

Acquerello,50,Absolutely Impeccable Service,"What a delight it is when one finds a modern dining room with a clear vision for old-school service. Acquerello is one of those amazing places. The food is very, very good. Perhaps not off-the-chart amazing… But, very nice. Will certainly return."

Acquerello,50,"Great Experience, Fabulous Food","Just enjoyed a fantastic dinner at Acquerello. Be prepared to rack up significant points on your American Express card when you dine here, you'll be that much closer to scoring your trip to Aruba. Loved the ambiance of this place, it's housed in an old chapel. The wait staff was attentive but not over bearing. My wife and I decided to go with the four course prix fixe menu. I won't bother to go into specifics of our choices, the main point is that EVERYTHING was delicious. We paired our meals with a Failla Pinot Noir, as recommended, and loved it. When asked if we were celebrating a special occasion my wife mentioned we were a month away from our anniversary so the staff turned our visit into an early celebration with an extra course. They were so nice. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening."

Acquerello,50,"Amazing, outstanding, innovative",We dined here with another couple celebrating our birthdays. We are all thought it was one of the very best meals we have ever had. The small surprises before we ordered were amazing. Each (there were three and a light grapefruit and vermouth drink) were exceptional. My husband remembered a dish we had there many years ago and and they said it was off the menu but they could prepare it for us. The staff were extremely attentive without being intrusive. The sommelier helped with the wine selection which was excellent. Each course was outstanding. We Highly recommend for special occasion dining.

Acquerello,30,Pricy but missed the bar,The room is quiet which we really liked. They are very attentively. The food was good but not great and we were underwhelmed. Maybe our expectations were to high. All of us felt it was not worth the price. The portions were small. We have other restaurants in San Francisco that we prefer and will not be revisiting this one.

The Butchers Arms,50,Birthday lunch,Recently had lunch here for a birthday celebration. What a fantastic experience it was too. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The service was impeccable and food was divine. We will definitely be coming again.

The Butchers Arms,50,Friday night dinner,"If you are somebody that reads the other reviews look how old the nine ""terrible"" reviews are, they are certainly no longer relevant. The atmosphere was lovely, the staff were friendly and efficient and the food was terrific. The 93.75% ""excellent"" and ""very good"" reviews should be noted, we will be going back."

The Butchers Arms,50,A warm welcome and a wonderful experience,We recently ate at this wonderful pub. Cannot recommend it highly enough. The food was sublime. They have a wonderful wine list. The staff are just excellent. Don't hesitate...just go and enjoy.

The Butchers Arms,50,Courses for horses!,"Dinner and an overnight stay in the cottage at The Butcher's Arms were the perfect prelude before a day at nearby Hartpury's International Horse Trials last weekend. The food was delicious and well on the way to achieving another Michelin Star. This is a 'proper' pub with seriously good restaurant food - in a delightful, old building that oozes character. The cottage is thoughtfully decorated and provided a very comfortable night's sleep - and only 1 minutes' walk from the restaurant!"

The Butchers Arms,50,Sublime…highly recommend,"Came for a spot of lunch with my Dad, we had the most amazing food that was beautifully presented. Service was slick and speedy with friendly staff. Highly recommend having a starter, main and pudding….and the English wine is delicious."

The Butchers Arms,50,Nice rural pub with great food,We had a really nice lunch here. The venue is very rustic but nicely done and comfortable. The log wood burner gave ambience and service was good And welcoming.    The menu was tasty with good options all well presented and very tasty. The crème brûlée was a highlight but all were good. Nice beer and some reasonable wines.    We will certainly return

The Butchers Arms,50,A rural gem,"We have just returned from 2 nights staying at this delightful pub in the Malvern/Cotswold borders.  Such a warm welcome awaited us and our little, one bedroom cottage was snug, well appointed with a very comfy bed. Bread, milk, tea, fresh coffee, pain au chocolate and cereal were stashed in the cupboards and fridge plus other extras such as butter, juice and jams.  We had dinner both nights in the pub itself and the food was totally delicious all served by friendly staff who were knowledgeable about the local area which was handy.  We will just have to return as only scratched the surface of all the places to visit, thank you Butchers Arms, we’ll be back😀"

The Butchers Arms,50,Outstanding.,Came with a large group of 16 ladies from our dining club & preordered our meal. Starters were perfection on a plate followed by even more perfection and superbly cooked mains and deserts. Couldn’t fault any of our meals. Excellent service. Stunning pub outside & in. Well done 10/10

The Butchers Arms,50,Lovely birthday lunch. Amazing,"Lovely birthday lunch. Amazing food, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Well worth the journey on the frosty roads"

The Butchers Arms,40,Lovely,"This was our second time at the Butchers arms, we went for late lunch Xmas eve and the atmosphere was lovely.  The staff had remembered we had two fish eaters in the group and had ensured there were two choices of starters.  Staff are chatty and attentive and work hard to make the meal special. My cod was lovely, my husband had the steak and enjoyed it but felt the choice of serving it with sprouts and gravy a bit odd. Considering the amazing presentation last time of the venison ( carved) we were surprised that it was just served as a whole steak, it just didn’t feel as special but none the less tasted good.  Lovely puddings, great moonshine, only slightly marred by an extremely drunk lady bizarrely joining our table with her dog just as we were trying to leave, the lady at the bar was aware though and did ask if we wanted her to be asked to leave, I thought she handled it very well. We will definitely be going again"

The Butchers Arms,50,A lovely way to celebrate a birthday,"We had a lovely celebration here and can’t recommend it enough! The guinea fowl and venison were particularly good, though I would say everything we tried was delicious. The staff were lovely, even though they were clearly busy, and we felt very welcome."

The Butchers Arms,50,Great small place that is must to visit if you are around,"Was visiting a college nearby with our daughter and decided to have lunch before heading back around there so was reasonably random choice by what was nearby.    The place is very small and looks very traditional inside for country pub. The menu is also not large at all which looks rather good than bad.    The quality, complexity and presentation of food is of quality you get in a very high end restaurant. I specifically like to mention the venison steak tartar - that was really amazing. My daughter had short ribs of beef that were full of flavors and not a typical main you can get in a restaurant. The wine list is of good quality and reasonably priced. I always take a selection of cheeses if available and the freshness was of very high standard there.    If we are to be around again we would definitely return."

The Butchers Arms,50,Superb food in a stunning place,"Spent an amazing few hours at the pub yesterday to celebrate my husbands birthday, and it didn’t disappoint. This was our first visit and it won’t be the last as we are already planning a return.  The pub is small and beautifully decorated with a timeless country feel, the log burner was on and very welcoming.  The service was excellent without being fussy and the food simply stunning.  I have nothing negative to say, thoroughly enjoyable afternoon."

The Butchers Arms,50,Vegetarian friendly? Are you having a giraffe?,"Came here today for my brothers birthday lunch. Someone sniffed a Michelin star chef or something....anyway the pub is super quaint. I mean there's a car park with gravel so you don't get your Gabor boots muddy &;the toilets are outside so maybe chilly in winter? But otherwise this place is to die for. I wish I could wrap it up & drop it the other side of the Malvern Hills in Cradley! When you walk in its full of locals quaffing ales at the bar, hops decorating the beams & a log fire...You also get Gille...the French erm whatever he was....super ironic, v funny 'I can make you that' who totally enhanced our lunch. I did try to wind him up with 'I'm vegan' but he batted me out of the park. I mean this isn't the place if yob are. I have a vegan daughter & we wisely left her at home working on her dissertation.. anyway....service was on point. (As you would expect I wise French hands) Nothing was too much trouble. My sister in law & I fancied moyitos....The menu was small but fantastic. We ate Bambi & monk fish. The mackerel was still breathing. I'd say the chef likes it fresh. The wine was 10/10. My only warning would be if you have a vegan/veggie in your party give the chef advance warning or leave them at home with your dogs!"

The Butchers Arms,30,Lovely little venue.,"Lovely venue, the menu was limited my wife likes vegetarian food when choice is limited, sadly none on menu, but after asking if available as an option one was offered! We guys only fancied the steak, ordered rare and medium rare sadly left on grill too long and wasn’t easy to cut even with the steak knife! very limited on vegetables just a roasted carrot a small amount of purée and the steak topped with water cress, only a red wine jus lacking flavour and large bowl of frozen chips when paying £31 a nice Stilton or pepper sauce would have been nice and hand cut chips. The cheese board was surprisingly limited just a small selection of nice cheeses just 2 oatcakes accompanied the cheese most places give way too much cheese just enough was given, we believe that some crackers were needed and butter as my friend struggled as everything was just too dry with just the oatcakes Considering the limited menu we believe more could be offered for the price charged . We had been recommended by friends as their new place to go, but we were disappointed as our meal for 4 came to over £150 with just 1 ale and water drinks. Sorry for the neutral feedback I did see one other feedback from last December with the same concerns with the steak."

The Butchers Arms,50,Amazing,"Everything about our lunch today was amazing. Food, incredible. Service, attentive and relaxed. Friendly, welcoming, gorgeous pub. I visited today with 2 friends for a special birthday lunch and was not disappointed. I will be back"

The Butchers Arms,50,Lovely,"Went to the Butchers Arms as a family Birthday treat, just 4 of us for lunch. Has the feel of a pub-cum-restaurant, in historical ex slaughter house. Food was excellent and we prefer smaller portions of well cooked, tasty food. Which was exactly what we got. An interesting menu. A great establishment to celebrate a special occasion. I'd recommend it."

The Butchers Arms,50,Book here it’s brilliant,Wonderful pub with fantastic food! From the first minute of booking I knew it was going to be great. We were visiting the local area and we saw this place and really wanted to dine here and we were not disappointed! Lovely fresh food with great service in a fantastic location. Staff so great they even dropped us back to our accommodation a couple of miles away after our meal as we couldn’t get taxi ! Now that’s service ! Book here you will not be disappointed in any way ! Such a great place with wonderful staff

The Butchers Arms,50,Wonderful birthday lunch,"The staff are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about their food and drinks. The menu was perfect, with sufficient choices and each of us had an excellent meal. The monk fish with chorizo and chick peas was delicious and the lamb rump cooked to perfection. Service was well paced."

The Butchers Arms,50,Superb!,"What a delightful country restaurant with secluded garden.  Our lunch was SUPERB!  My wife and I had the best lobster that either of us can ever recall  Superb starters (squid and cod roe) and delicious raspberry and strawberry shortbread pudding.  Attentive, friendly but unobtrusive service .  Our friends were equally happy with their menu choices.  Worth a significant detour or an ideal ""halfway"" meeting location not far from the M50 and A38.  Well done to the new chef and his smiling wife!"

The Butchers Arms,50,Top notch!,I’m not one for repeat reviews but following our most recent visit where the team adapted the menu to meet my wife’s “unusual” appetite I have to say thank you and also praise the excellent cooking and service!

The Butchers Arms,50,The Butchers Arms,"Top- quality service, with amazingly crafted food !  Really do recommend taking the effort to come out and try this place."

The Butchers Arms,50,A lunch to relish,"I have been here before but it was well before the Covid crisis and it is now under new ownership. It had a Michelin Star before so I was glad to see that it is still here. So I thought I would provide an update. I went here for lunch last week with my wife. We had to book in advance, so nothing has changed there then.    It's still hard to find unless you know where you're going. But anyway, we were shown to our table by w lady wearing a face mask, which she kept on throughout all the time we were there. We sat by the side of the bar in the small alcove by the kitchen.    The menu has remained small with about 4 starters and mains and a couple more desserts. I can't remember what we had for starters but my wife had a lovely Hereford Steak and I opted for the Halibut Steak. She said the steak was perfect and wonderfully pink in the centre. We also decided to treat ourselves to desserts on offer and had a thick Chocolate Mouse with biscuit, which was absolutely delicious. I also had a couple of pints of local ale and my wife stuck to her usual soft drinks.    If I had one problem it was this. My plate for my main meal was not piping hot, which I would have preferred. That meant that the Halibut turned to being warm a little sooner than I anticipated. However, I am not going to offer severe criticism over that little trifle. The lunch was expensive, but when you need a little treat at times you have to push the boat out. We paid just under 100 sheets for the lot. Just glad we didn't have the young one with us as she loves her steaks and chocolate too.    In summary, another fabulous meal and another triumph for the Butchers Arms. As the Terminator once said ""I'll be back"""

The Butchers Arms,50,Fabulous meal in quintessential setting,"My best friend and I visited The Butchers Arms mid-week in December. The twinkly Christmas lights outside were a festive welcome and it looked like a scene from the film ""The Holiday"". Inside was warm and cosy with log fires roaring. There are two seating areas with the bar in the middle and we sat in a room with three tables and a wood burner. The menu choice was small but we still had difficulty choosing what to eat. I had venison for a main and extremely posh and yummy trifle for dessert. We had a lovely sparkling and red wine. Staff were lovely and the service was good. In my opinion, this is a special occasion restaurant but wear your cosy cashmere and suede boots for this quintessential setting. I will visit again with my husband. Thank you the Butchers Arms."

The Butchers Arms,50,Great lunch,"Spoke with Jo reserving a table for 12 and requested a specific meal. On every occasion we spoke, Jo was friendly and positive to my requests. Some of our party were elderly or suffering from health issues and had concerns regarding COVID. Jo was ahead of the game and had already been taking extra precautions for several weeks, reacting to the data rather than waiting for government direction. Lots of thoughtful actions such as suggesting using another door if our guests had concerns about walking through the restaurant.    Both the meal itself and service were very good. Nothing was too much trouble. Nice wine list. Lots of positive comments from our diners.    We will be back very soon, Thank you."

The Butchers Arms,50,First time but not the last!,"We arrived on a cold day just as heavy rain started, so a quick dash from the car park. We opened the door into a warm and welcoming pub plus a happy smile from behind the bar, the scene was set for what was clearly going to be a great lunch. We were with friends who had been several times before. We travelled from Chipping Campden (50 mins) and it was well worth the journey. Service was friendly, professional and attentive. Food was exceptional. There’s a good selection of interesting starters, mains and puds/cheese. We had different starters then we all selected the venison, which was outstanding. I’m struggling to think how we could have a had a better experience, thank you to all. It’s not been an easy time for the hospitality sector and this small team clearly have a passion to deliver the best experience for the customers, both old and new."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Outstanding!,"I was lucky enough to be treated to lunch at Le Manoir as I was celebrating a special birthday. It certainly exceeded expectations and was outstanding. In fact, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we have had in this country. We were taken care of from the moment we arrived to when we departed. All the staff was friendly and welcoming.  The atmposhere felt more relaxed than I was expecting, with some guests in casual dress.  We enjoyed drinks on the terrace before lunch and were lucky with the weather. We did not feel rushed at any time.  We had a tasting menu with a flight of wines and everything was exquisitely presented and delicious. The service was excellent and slick. The sommelier carefully informed us on our selection of wine and each one complimented the dish with which it was served. Oh and what a wonderful choice of bread!  After lunch, we were able to choose a table to sit at in the garden. The waitress quickly found us and knew exactly who was having each drink although she had not been serving us at lunch. An example of the attention to detail we experienced throughout our time there.  Later we had a wander through the beautiful gardens. No one seemed to be worried about where we were although we had not paid at that stage. It all felt relaxed and we felt very much at home.  What a treat! I am now trying to come up with an excuse to go back!"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Outstanding.    I cannot choose my favourite aspect of the meal as it was all simply wonderful.    The service was second to none, the atmosphere was friendly but efficient, the surroundings are sublime and relaxing but of course, the main attraction being a gastronomic delight.    I’d go back tomorrow and have exactly the same meal again and again. Loved it every second."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,40,Lovely but not as we remembered it.,The setting and service were faultless but I'm afraid I have to agree with a few recent reviews in that the food did not bowl us over as it has done in the past. The meat course was pork but the piece I had had a large amount of inedible fat and a bit or cartilage which is not something you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre. A consomme was a bit oily and again did not wow with flavour. I'm not sure if Raymond was in the kitchen or not but this may have had something to do with it.

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,"Superb, whatever the season!","My wife and I dined here back in January to celebrate her birthday (a round number!) - and it was possibly one of the most perfect restaurant experiences we have had. The team are professional but friendly and know exactly how to hold a conversation, the lounges are comfortable but not overly manicured, the dining room is smart but not pretentious and the food was obviously - superb. Have I had better courses in other restaurants? Yes I have, but the impressive thing was the consistency across the entire meal. Every single course was superb, let's say an 8.5/10 .. every one. The control and precision of the dining room was very impressive, never a crumb out of place. By the way - the bread here is to die for, and they are very generous with it too - my wife jokes about coming back here just for bread and cheese! Would we recommend? Absolutely. Would we come back? Absolutely."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,"Wonderful, Amazing, Fantastic 5 course tasting menu",Words fail to say how wonderful our 5 course tasting menu was the other night. The food from start to end had amazing depths of flavor and every mouthful was a revelation. Wish we could go back and eat it all again.  Service is at a nice leisurely pace and special mention must go to our wonderful waiter Tom who served and explained every dish to add to the wonder of the meal.  We will definitely be back. Hopefully sooner rather than later.

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Everything was Fantastic,"The moment we pulled up into the stunning grounds we felt special. The service from check inn was so friendly and professional , and the choice of English sparkling was the best I’ve ever tasted. We sat in the beautiful gardens enjoying our sparkling wine and the work that goes into the gardens is incredible. We got checked into our dog friendly room, and wow amazing. The size was huge, and had everything and more. We had dog beds, dog bowls, treats, think the dogs were on their hols.  A freshly made lemon cake was waiting for us to eat and fresh fruit from the gardens. All so tasty. They even give you boxes to take away.  We did the cellar tour, which was really interesting and the glass of champagne you get was defo worth it.  Evening Dinner 7 course taster was just divine. The service here is the best I’ve ever had, and everything was just perfect.  The breakfast also was lovely, and again impeccable service.  Yes it is expensive to stay and eat here, but you can see why. The work that goes into the gardens, grounds and the service you get, is worth every penny. This is a place to come for a very special treat and you’ll be made to feel very special too.  I so recommend this place"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Amazing experience,"A perfect experience from the moment we arrived to celebrate our daughter's birthday here.  Welcome drink, the most amazing lemon cake and fruit platter in the room. There is everything you could possibly need in the room.  Tasting menu was served and presented to perfection, we enjoyed the wines served alongside each course.  Lots of choice at breakfast and then we did the garden tour which was informative and entertaining.  We loved the whole experience.. its just a different level to anywhere we have been before... the staff just can't do enough for you."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,“Definitely Deserves the 3rd Michelin Star”,"“Definitely Deserves the 3rd Michelin Star”    It is no coincidence that a great meal is expected in this breathtaking property. From the gardens, the statues and works of art, to the perfectly kept Manoir. The friendliness of the staff and its professionalism.    The menu was well thought and well performed. Techniques were on point and the flavors and textures divine. The prices are what you expect in a restaurant with a menu, chefs and staff of this caliber.    We had as a cherry on top the opportunity to enjoy the visit of the Chef. Raymond Blanc himself who spent a wonderful and charming time with us. We even had our menu signed by the Chef himself. What an honor!    Well done guys, we loved everything and we are looking forward to coming again and again.    Warmest Regards    Chefs. Gianfranco & Anna Chiarini  Dieci Boutique Restaurant"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,30,"Slightly let down with food, but in a beautiful setting with great wine.","The food didn't meet expectations, especially considering the price point. I felt that particular set menu was uninspiring. I also found the seasoning wasnt great, the canapes were the highlight.. Great wine and cheese selections though."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,30,Very Disappointing,"Previously we have enjoyed our lunches at Le Manoir so were very surprised snd disappointed to be faced with chewy scallops, undercooked lamb and fat not rendered. At the price paid we always expect perfection which was not the case."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,"Great food, Friendly service & beautiful garden","We had a tasting menu to celebrate our anniversary and birthday.  Everything was beautifully presented and tasty.  We were a little bit disappointed as they did not serve lobster as per the menu we saw in the website before we booked, instead scallop . However we were not disappointed with the scallop as it was big, juicy and tasty.  We were very pleased that they served us an extra mango sorbet for our celebration.  We had a tea / coffee in their lovely garden. We also took advantage to walk around the Japanese & vegetable garden, The Japanese garden was beautiful - which made our day out perfect!"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Le Manoir,"Sublime from start to finish! The location, the grounds, the inside, the outside, the food, the drinks, the service - all wonderful. Awestruck to meet the man himself, both turned into gibbering idiots talking to him!"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Lunch Tasting Menu,"This is quite easily the best food I've ever had the pleasure to eat. We had the six course lunch tasting menu, which turned out to be 8 with canapés and chocs with tea and coffee. 1st class service, beautiful setting and food to die for."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Fine dining at its finest,"Can’t find fault with anything here, food is amazing! Every course was delicious any foodie would enjoy it!"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Superb dinner,"Amazing experience and fabulous dinner. Service was absolutely spot on, and food / drink were really excellent. A superb location for a special occasion"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Absolutely perfect,"Let me lead with the headline. This was the most perfect dining experience I have ever had in my 60ish years on the planet. Me and my partner booked an overnight stay and the tasting menu.    So let me break this down.    The location is beautiful, a well managed estate of sculptures, herb gardens, orchards and Le Manoir itself. Quiet let us say. Don’t come here if you want a spar, are a gym bunny or the party lifestyle. This is quiet elegance far removed from all that. .    The staff or brigade. They are wonderful. From the time you arrive to the time you leave you are treated by everyone with politeness, good humour and utmost efficiency. Everyone knows their job and does it brilliantly.    The food. We had the tasting menu plus cheese. Absolutely wonderful. A few things I personally wasn’t keen on (I don’t do courgettes) but that is what a tasting menu is, to get you to try things. And you have to. The cooking was exemplary, faultless even. Indeed I devoured the lot. The menu comprised of 7 course which is seasonally adapted. So when you go determines what you get.    The drinks. I had the wine tasting menu chosen by the sommelier to compliment each course, my partner had the non alcoholic drinks tasting menu (yes you heard that correctly, a non alcoholic tasting menu). Each drink was wonderfully explained and expertly delivered.    The dining experience. Pre booking this was my big concern. Personally I don’t do formal very well. Sitting in a suit eating is not my idea of fun. Weddings with everyone in posh frocks and suits is not my thing. I needn’t have worried. Everyone dining was relaxed, open collars, relaxed. Smart but no peacocking. You knew from the car park there were some very wealthy people in the room, but a big take away was that we were all just there for some great food.    The room. Wonderfully art deco, pristinely clean and everything you need for an extremely comfortable stay, although I did find the light switches a bit of a learning curve.    So in summation. This is expensive, actually very expensive, but it was a treat. It is likely I may never do this again. If you are lucky enough to try it then do, you will create a memory that will live with you forever.    I thank everyone at Le Manoir for such a memorable day."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,An enchanted evening,"The entire evening was magical! Arrived well in advance to allow for a tour of the gardens- which is absolutely worth it! I've never seen Brussel sprout plants as large and the map provided helps ensure you make it as far as the orchards - where the apples are on trellises. Drinks in the lounge before dinner were very relaxed and the 8 course tasting menu was delightful. The marriage of flavors was exceptional throughout - with caviar topping and hazelnut mousse as taste sensations. The horseradish accent was perfect with the mackerel, too. All in all an exceptional evening at an exceptional place."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Pure class,"No detail is trivial. Superb food, Suberin wine, superb service. A delight in a world where quality is in decline. Merci."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,40,Not quite on point this time,"I’ve had equally good, if not better, food at some non and one Michelin starred restaurants.  The food whilst good is not particularly memorable.    Cons  Our choice of wine was out of stock.  No offer of a la carte, just the set menu.  Main course lamb lacking in flavour  Coffee luke warm  Tea ridiculously weak  Felt that we were the early lunch sitting and needed to vacate the table for the next sitting.    Pros  Beautiful setting.  Food presentation superb.  Lovely vegetable gardens to stroll around after lunch."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Amazing & better than you can imagine. !!,"Was treated to a Garden Suite for 2 nights of Heaven. All the were Divine. From the moment you arrive, the ambience, the service, the Gardens & above all the food is all Other Wordly. In short, Divine. All the special touches from Champagne Tea on arrival to the 7 course tasting Dinner Menu.Breakfast & treats Superb!! Totally deserves its 2 Michelin stars. Absolutely nothing has been forgotten or skimped on. I have eaten in some wonderful Michelin Restaurants but this truly is The Real Experience. Figs & orange blossom in our private Garden. A once in a lifetime treat. Don’t hesitate. The staff are truly delightful & along with the best service Ever one feels totally relaxed & “at home” Which is their Motto “Welcome Home” I didn’t want to leave EVER!! Fabulous !! Massively Expensive I expect,(my husband would not divulge the final bill) but worth every penny. Even a bag of treats on departure….Nothing left to say!!  PS We could have taken our pooch but then we probably could not have eaten in the Main dining room but dogs allowed in other areas!! He got a Box of treats from Le Manoir too…."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Gastronomic Delight!,"It was an amazing experience. The 7 course taster menu was delicious and perfectly presented. We felt it was well worth the money.  We were not rushed, the staff were friendly and curteous, and each course was explained in great detail of the ingredients used.  The artwork that goes into presenting their dishes are exceptional.  The grounds at Le Manoir are incredible. The garden tour was informative and interesting.  Loved, loved, loved it!  Thank you!"

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,30,Disappointed,"Very excited going. Grounds, setting and restaurants stunning.    Food very hit and mix. Canapés amazing, gazpacho not so as spoiled by frozen tomato granola.    Most disappointing was the lobster. Should be the star, but completely overpowered by curry and mango.    Other dishes on the tasting menu good without being memorable.    Staff very friendly and service as good as you would expect, but did seem quite robotic at times.    Feel as though they are relying on the brand."

Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons Restaurant,50,Wonderful New Year from arrival to departure …,"Could not fault a moment of our stay and wonderful New years Eve dinner …    Beautiful room in the Dove Cote, champagne on arrival, gifts in the room, beautiful tasting menu with wine, danced the night away and then a sumptuous breakfast before heading off with our good bag of treats !    Thank you so much"

Lazy Bear,30,Not what they were,"Third, and last, visit. They are just coasting with little passion or innovation. Servers rushed with scripted descriptions and limited interactions. Flat champagne, replaced on request. Mediocre pairings especially reserve. Den dessert overloaded with sweet wines and two way too sweet desserts. Fading glory."

Lazy Bear,50,Amazing and delightful splurge! Get reservations in advance!,One of the best meals of my life. The food is amazing and delightful! It's such a fun experience and every bite was delectable. The chef came out and explained every dish so you know exactly what you're eating and waht makes it special. Can't wait to go back! I think it's rare they have walk-ins so I'd make a reservation in advance.

Lazy Bear,50,"An amazing experience, worth every penny","Lazy Bear nailed it from the moment you step inside. The food and presentation was phenomenal, as was the service and overall experience. So good I'm going back with family this month :)"

Lazy Bear,50,"An amazing dining experience, fantastic food and wine, with a beautiful team","I consider it a priviliege to have had a private dining event at Lazy Bear. From the moment we sat down at the communal table, with the open kitchen next to us, and had the introduction of the story of the restaurant, we knew we in for an amazing journey.    Each dish was paired with a different wine, and we were given the story behind both, before enjoying the amazing flavours in front of us. The team were so friendly, knowledgeable and took the time to get to know us and were part of the evening.    I took no photos as I was totally engaged with the event, and after finishing each course, your mind and conversation was totally taken with discussing the flavours and what would come next.    I will definately return at some point, and it will live long in the memory. Thank you."

Lazy Bear,50,Best taster menu we have ever had! What a way to celebrate a birthday 🥳,"The most amazing food I have ever tasted! The lamb chop and rib….wow and the tomato! It’s basically ruined me ever eating a supermarket tomato again! So much passion, care, attention to detail. Loved the presentation, the small details, the breakfast gift, the interaction with ALL the staff… not one weak link, amazing place, experience, a special occasion to celebrate my husbands birthday that we will never forget, thank you so much lazy bear!!"

Lazy Bear,40,A Speedy Dinner Service Is Certainly NOT the Way to Enjoy Michelin Quality Cuisine,"I’m glad I went! I thoroughly enjoyed the creative, innovative, and tasty food and the spot-on drinks pairing. However, the speed at which they dropped off the courses along with the speedy delivery of the accompanying explanation (of both food and drinks) left both of us with a less than stellar impression of the Lazy Bear. This is not a food issue because as I mentioned it was worthy of the star and each course quite delicious. I think our most memorable portion of the experience was the after-dinner drinks in the den with desserts (a worthy upcharge over the standard tasting menu). There at least we were allowed to relax, take our time and enjoy the combination of desserts with a trio of Chateau D’Yquem dessert wines."

Lazy Bear,50,Delightful food and experience!,Absolutely delightful. Every dish was well described and sooo delish 😃 innovative culinary experience in presentation and preparation. Highly recommend! One of my favorite Michelin experiences and worth the money.

Lazy Bear,50,More than a dinner,"Loved it. Our second time and liked it even more than before! Highly expensive but more than “just food” it is a learning experience. Staff did their best through masks and need to hurry between distanced patrons and were fairly effective. We actually enjoyed being inside an were fortunate to be at the kitchen end of the table. Loved the birthday card rather than a yucky dessert. My only slight criticism, sommelier encouraged us both to upscale the wine pairings for an additional cost and I wish we’d stuck to our original plan of having just one of us do so to increase the number of tastings. But other than that slight quibble we give you rave reviews. It was a dinner for the record books and the second time around we were familiar enough to maximize the experience even more. Hurray for Lazy Bear!    Pssst - Lazy Bear, how about giving us return customers a secret option to book one day earlier than the general public???"

Lazy Bear,50,Better than ever!,"Lazy Bear is an absolutely phenomenal restaurant where the creativity of its dishes really surpasses anything else in SF. Due to COVID, the restaurant was set up with multiple tables versus the one, long table the restaurant is known for. We"

Lazy Bear,50,Teamwork always wins,"An amazing job of providing a Michelin star dining experience while keeping it fun.  There were several things that were so impressive.  First of all was the staff. We had a seat on the balcony which gave us an overhead view of the kitchen and most of the restaurant. It was amazing to watch the choreography of the staff. From our fantastic waiter Daniel, who was obviously a sommelier in disguise to the many staff members who not only delivered each dish but gave a complete explanation including origins of the products, you were left with the feeling you weren't just eating a dish, you were partaking in the process. Nobody was rushed, any questions were answered.  Do the wine pairing, it's amazing!  One thing I loved was there are no ""supplements"" or ""upcharges"" for food. Our meal included Caviar and A5 Wagyu beef. In any other place I have been that would have been extra. It always leaving me feeling like I have to pay extra to get your best product. Very impressive  I wanted to pick out a couple of dishes to highlight but it's very difficult, everything from the soft shelled crab, a personal favorite of mine to the incredible wagyu, the strawberry dessert to..... you get the idea.  They give you a ""field guide"" and a pencil to write down tasting notes. My wife, who has a masters in reading, commented ""there simply aren't enough words in the english language to describe amazing""  Note for the kitchen, particularly Taylor at the pass- I did use salt on the first tea dish but I didn't touch it again!  They send you home with breakfast for the next morning! I'm eating mine as I write this and what a fun idea. It really brings back the memories. One suggestion for those of us in hotels- a little plastic spoon would be really handy.  Fantastic experience, the Lazy Bear is a meal on par with any fine dining establishment in the world, particularly if you like to add interaction and fun to your experience."

Lazy Bear,50,"Great for a Birthday, or any other Celebration","Went with our son to celebrate wife's birthday. This was a wonderful experience. Would put this right up there with Saison and Angler as one of the best dining experiences in San Fran. The tasting menu was excellent, would also recommend the accompanying wine menu for the meal. And it all ended on the most exquisite note, a deconstructed key lime pie dessert which was fabulous."

Lazy Bear,50,Favorite in San Francisco; best birthday dinner!,"This is an amazingly creative restaurant that is one of my favorites. Over many years, I’ve had the fortune of enjoying the French Laundry, Per Se, Daniel, Eleven Madison Park,  l'atelier de joël robuchon, Guy Savoy, etc. I liked this one the most, along with Alinea. That’s because both Lazy Bear and Alinea deviate from the standard formula of those listed above. They are more theatrical and social. Lazy Bear was particularly interesting because everyone starts off in an upstairs space, where you are free to socialize with other patrons. After having a few courses in a cocktail party setting, you go downstairs and dine at one of two large communal tables. Each chef in the kitchen comes out and introduces a dish that all guests are served at approximately the same time. It really is a creative, social, amazing experience. It’s a great place to celebrate. I celebrated my birthday there and had a blast. Definitely do the wine pairings if you like wine! They had generous and creative pours."

Lazy Bear,50,Unique Tasting Menu Experience,"If you want to kick off a trip to the Bay area with a bang, this is the place to go. The 8:30 seating, the later of two, began in the modern rustic mezzanine in a dinner party atmosphere with the first 5 of 17 courses served as canapes paired with plum punch and champagne. Most of the guests quickly warmed to the company of strangers, some on first dates, others celebrating special occasions, some with friends, others solo. The crowd of approximately 50 people varied in interests and formality but all had one thing in common ~ a love of exquisitely prepared, delicious food.  As we watched the buzz and new-found camaraderie of the first seating below dissipate with grins that shone of culinary delight, our anticipation of what to come grew. Once the 2 long tables forming the audience of an open kitchen were cleared, we were invited to our reserved seats and given a date stamped 'field guide' detailing our courses with space to take notes.  The Michelin-Starred performance that ensued was a work of art. Keeping an energetic but appropriate pace, the dishes were served to each table simultaneously with a different chef explaining each one to the crowd as it came out. We were advised to start as each one arrived, without delay, as the respective chef spoke. This contributed to the easy yet fashionably sophisticated ambiance and allowed for the flow of both food and conversation to take a natural, relaxed style.  Our favourites included the following.  His: 1) Sungolds including summer squash, nasturtium, cape gooseberry with aromatic herbs and leaves 2) Melons with lime verbena, lemon balm, avocado and purslane 3) Barbecued rack of lamb with shelling beans, shishito, lambs tongue heirloom tomato pie with horseradish.  Mine: 1) Chanterelle and goat cheese tart with Lisa's 'BoDacious', pickled nectaplum and sunflower 2) Fresh corn grits with Lazy Bear Butter and Australian winter truffle 3) Grilled fig with charred vanilla bean and fig leaf  The wine pairing is definitely recommended to make the most of this incredible experience. This is one cool place!"

Lazy Bear,40,Birthday Dinner,"My wife and I had dinner at Lazy Bear on a Friday night. When you arrive you're escorted upstairs and seated near other guests in a very intimate setting and encouraged to make friends. In San Francisco at a establishment like theirs - there's definitely something you're going to have in common with everyone and my wife and really liked the 7 or so people we were placed with. You have a few amuse-bouches (single bite appetizers) and any beverages you're paired with if you chose that option or a list of a la carte drinks. You are then escorted downstairs and seated next to new people - at first we were a little bummed we weren't seated next to our 'upstairs friends' but upon whispering my displeasure to my wife (seated across from me) the guy next to me said, ""what are we, chopped liver."" I apologized for my rudeness and we then made friends with the couple seated next us. The dinner is comprised of small plates, each explained by one of the chefs. There are 8 or so chefs in the working kitchen next to the tables and even more in another location. You're encouraged to talk tot hem and ask questions during service, although it's a little intimidating and I didn't see anyone do it. The plates were good, there were a few deserts. My wife and I did the reserve wine pairing, it was pretty good, although the desert wines and port was lost on us. It was a fun night, a good birthday, and they gave me a birthday card signed by every employee, that was a nice touch (no candle though :)"

Lazy Bear,50,"Don’t hesitate, go now!","What a performance. This is definetely the new style in « fancy » dining. Relaxed atmosphere, relaxed but stylish service, absolute customer driven staff and management. All of the chefs did perform at their top, none of the dishes where average, they where all top and using local selected sourcing. I remember particularly the tartare of lamb, the tomato and the morel mushroom assemblage.  We had the reserve wine pairing and tasted some rare and fabulous wines. All of it was pricey but worth every dollar. Go now before they get their third Michelin star what will force them to increase the prices. Just pick up the phone, reserve your table and Go!"

Lazy Bear,50,Special Occasion - Fun Night,"Love the way they start you out upstairs and then move you downstairs after a few courses. The courses were delicious, my favorite was a fresh local peas in a broth with bit of ham, for many in our party it was the rack of lamb. The courses are many and varied, there is definitely something that should appeal to everyone. We sat next to a delightful group and had a fun conversation comparing opinions on local restaurants. The highlight of the meal was the sommelier, we told him what we like in wine, gave him the price point and left it to him. He made excellent choices and we liked his sense of humor."

Lazy Bear,40,Great concept and good food!,"We had dinner at Lazy Bear on our last night in San Francisco. It's one of those restaurant where you essentially have to book and pay in advance but we were lucky enough to find a table just a week before.    The website seemed intriguing promising a ""dinner party"" and on that front the experience certainly delivered on that promise. Essentially you start upstairs, seated or standing with other guests eating and drinking through the first few courses. We had opted for the premium wine pairing and they were certainly very generous with the pours. Once that's done, they bring you downstairs where you are seated along two long communal table. In our case we sat with different people than upstairs which gave us the opportunity to meet new people. Once seated, someone will announce a course at the front near the kitchen and then everyone is promptly served.    The food was good if not mind blowing and the service was efficient and friendly. It felt like the first part of the meal was timed perfectly with enough time to enjoy the meal but i'm not sure if they were behind schedule, the second part of the meal really felt rush where we went through the last few course in such rapid succession that we didn't get to enjoy them as much or for that matter enjoy the conversation with our fellow guests.    Timing issue aside, we had a great time and wouldn't hesitate coming back. Lazy Bear is definitely on to something great here and i hope they keep working on making it perfect."

Lazy Bear,50,Wow! What an experience!,We were lucky enough to get a reservation at Lazy Bear during our visit to San Francisso in May. We enjoy food (a lot) and have been to many tasting menu restaurants. Lazy Bear was right up there with the best of them.

Lazy Bear,50,"Stop reading and reserve a table, ASAP","Here is a list of things to know -  * They have a newsletter you can subscribe to on their website - That's the best way to know when they open up new dates. Got the email, made the reservation for the date and time I wanted, easy peasy.  * Drinks/cocktails - Amazing.  * Chefs introducing each course - Just seeing how they enjoy their art makes you appreciate the food even more.  * My wife doesn't eat fish - It was amazing how they worked around it and how personal it felt when she got an explanation on how her dishes were made when fish was involved.  * Service - Phenomenal  * Food - The most crucial part. Speechless. Perfection.  * Dress code - Not really, but most people were ~business casual    Before you read the review - Just go there! Yes, stop reading and reserve a table, ASAP. You won't be disappointed. Reading the review and seeing the photos might spoil this wonderful experience.  My wife and I try to visit a new Michelin star restaurant every time one of celebrates a birthday (easier than getting a gift!) and in every new country we visit. So, we've been to more than a few by now. My all-time favorite place is Gordon Ramsey in London, with a score of almost perfection (let's say 98/100). This is my #2 restaurant of all times by a tiny margin - I would say 95/100.  A good Michelin star restaurant is more than just the food. It's a journey the chef is taking you, it's a show, it's an experience. I know it sounds cliche and corny, but the steep price you are paying is for the whole package, which is usually more than just what is on the plate in front of you.  In a three-star experience, the feeling usually is very formal, almost like going to a ballet or an opera. You nod your head, feel important but don't understand half of it. The atmosphere is Lazy Bear if very refreshing and different (yes, I am aware they are a two-star restaurant). Still fine dining, but slightly less formal. The team makes you feel like you are visiting their home and invited to an elegant dinner, rather than the ""heavy"" atmosphere you might get in other restaurants of this caliber.  I won't spoil the fun and write what happens when you enter the place. You can read it below, in other reviews, but I think it might spoil the adventure somehow. Photos do not make justice to the food. Go there."

Lazy Bear,40,A pricey but worthwhile party.,"Like most of The Bay Area’s most highly regarded Restaurants dinner at Lazy Bear does not come cheap, a nearly-$300 ticket before Beverages the cost of entry to what is essentially an upscale dinner party for forty willing participants, conducted over the course of just under three hours in The Mission.    Started as an underground pop-up, a “lottery” system replaced by online tickets when the concept turned brick-and-mortar, it by request that diners arrive fifteen minutes before their assigned start time to mix and mingle upstairs, a scoop of communal punch bright with Grapefruit as well as Booze followed by several small bites plus Chef Barzelay’s special Pommeau recipe for solos who are introduced by staff and seated across from one another.    The nation’s most highly rated “dinner party” per Michelin, two-stars in the 2019 guide placing Lazy Bear one above Chicago’s EL Ideas and un-rated spots like Playground 2.0 or Travail Kitchen, it is beginning in a well-appointed loft that a flurry of bites arrive in five-minute intervals, the most memorable a lazy-cut Egg emptied and refilled with its scrambled contents plus Hot Sauce and Syrup or the Petit Four of Foie Gras carefully highlighted by Ginger and Fruit.    Proceeding downstairs after half-an-hour, the night’s other solo diner a talkative man from Boston in town for a tech conference, it was toward the head of the table that full-vantage of Chef David and his team was offered, each member subsequently introducing a dish and inviting diners to walk up, get close and ask questions at any time.    Presenting the menu as a “field guide” complete with an area for notes, the ten courses to follow beginning with Parker House Rolls employing Spelt and Rye in combination with tangy Butter, it was following an offer for more Bread that plate one arrived, the combination of salt and bitterness at first startling but soon finding balance with smoke and a sweet linger that led nicely into a follow-up dish featuring generous chunks of Crab suspended in foam atop tender Grits and the Crustacean’s “Brains.”    Serious about sourcing, the menu described by Barzelay as “evolving” rather than changing with the season, it was utilizing both Flesh and Offal of local Abalone that the ninth of fifteen offerings showed well, the crispy Cabbage largely just for texture while flavors of the sea predominated, just as they would with Sacramento White Sturgeon served in a light soup alongside Brandade generously topped with Caviar.    Generous with Beverage pairings, the room growing louder with each course though servers remain a bit stiff, it was after explaining a multi-step process of aging, smoking and grilling that Duck Breast with shattering Skin was served essentially “a l’Orange,” both it and the Vegetable-centric Bordelaise to follow anything but “lazy” and the latter particularly noteworthy as it managed to completely reinvent Celeriac as rich and meaty rather than an earthy Starch.    Ordering Coffee before progressing to Dessert, Lazy Bear’s “Cold Brew” rich and creamy with a hint of Molasses, it was from a trio of Pastry Chefs that six items were presented, the Orange Creamsicle mellow and fun thanks to popping Candy while the Donut to follow was unfortunately dry and unimaginative, the better bites coming as Mignardises including a Pear-shaped Cookie splashed with Sherry and bite-sized Éclair piped with Candy Cap Mushroom Cream."

Lazy Bear,50,A Great Experience,"This restaurant doesn’t need another great review from me, but I am happy to give them one. What a pleasure to dine here. This was my second time and it was as good as the first time. My only tiny, tiny complaint is that we felt a little bit rushed. They do two seatings each night and the early seating both times for me felt a little rushed."

Lazy Bear,50,Special Occasion Extravagance!,"Our son who lives in SF was LUCKY to get a reservation for the three of us (my husband and the mom unit) a month in advance. And he pre-paid for the food. I think they may open reservations around mid-month...anyway, do note that this is an exclusive and very expensive culinary experience. My husband and I paid for the wine pairings to go with the 6-7 small-bite courses and this is the way to go: you want to pay attention to everything the staff is telling you, and it would take way too much time to try to sort through the comprehensive wine list and figure out what pairs with what. A very special and memorable night!!!!!!!"

Lazy Bear,50,"Great experience, even better food","Our group of 5 had a great experience at Lazy Bear. Knowledge & enthusiasm of staff was impressive. Wine pairings were spot on, and custom to our preferences. I would recommend for any size group. We were a combo of co-workers & friends and the atmosphere was perfect to create conversation."

Lazy Bear,50,Best Dinner in SF,"The drawing room style comfortable casual fine dining experience is a rare combination. The American fare focuses heavily on local produce - I found out that even the caviar and truffles they use are from within 100 miles!!! Love the format, the theater and the interaction with the chefs and line cooks."

Lazy Bear,40,Casual Fine Dining,"I can see why this restaurant has great reviews. It is a fine dining experiencing without the pretentious atmosphere. Came here for an anniversary/birthday dinner with friends. The restaurant was amazing in accommodating my food allergies. The customized menu that acknowledged our special occasion was very much appreciated. The restaurant is decorated as a comfy cabin where you begin upstairs with a couple refreshing drinks and appetizers. Then you are lead downstairs to your seat where you see the staff working in harmony to create each dish. I had a lovely night except for the server who kept referring to me as ""Maria"" (which is not my name). If you have a chance to dine here, I highly recommend it."

Lazy Bear,50,Foodie's delight!!!!,"My husband and I are from Chicago and whenever we travel, we try to hit as many Michelin starred restaurants as possible. We managed to get in off the waitlist for dinner on a Friday night. Not only was the food excellent, but it was a complete blast!! The whole dinner party theme is very well executed. From the drinks and apps in the upstairs balcony room, to the communal tables and free flowing alcohol, this makes for an excellent time. I had the review from the woman who got hammered while attending Lazy Bear by herself and it brought me to tears. I should have paid attention to the warning as my recollection of the dessert courses were very blurred. We had lovely dinner companions and lots of enjoyable conversations. This is such a wonderful concept restaurant and we are hoping that something like this pops up in Chicago. We will be back again if we can get tickets, the next time that we are in San Francisco."

Lazy Bear,50,"Unique, delicious, friendly, attentive, but $$$$$","This was definitely a meal like I’ve never experienced before. Since the menu changes each night, I didn’t take many pictures, but suffice it to say that you have probably never experienced a meal like this before. My faves when we went we’re the soft-shell crab, the wagyu beef, the squab, the salmon, buttermilk melon soda, corn grits, cereal grains, cheesecake truffle, the pancake macaron, and the cold brewed coffee. All were carefully prepared and presented. Pleasurable to look at, but even more so to eat. There were some less favorites, but with 18 different items to try, I am pleased?    The dinner party theme was amazing as well. It felt like a great social event. Even the chefs and waitstaff were ready to explain anything you wanted. We were so surprised to get an anniversary card signed by the entire staff!    We did the wine pairing, which made the meal even more enjoyable.    Hats off to the chefs, hosts and servers to make this a very special event for us. Try it, but be prepared to enjoy maybe the most expensive meal you’ve ever had."

Lazy Bear,50,Amazing Culinary Experience!,My wife and I dined here and we loved every minute of the experience. You are first escorted upstairs for a cocktail hour where you are served drinks and a few small courses. Then you are taken downstairs to sit at communal tables for dinner. We enjoyed talking and interacting with our table mates. The service was 5 star and the atmosphere was fun and casual. The food was inventive and absolutely delicious. The menu changes often so we cant wait to come back to try again! They were also very accommodating to my wife who is pregnant and cannot eat certain foods. They really went all out to make our night special.

Lazy Bear,50,Outstanding in every way,"Lazy Bear is a unique exceptional experience in every way- the service is impeccable, the food is playful, creative and out of this world delicious and the presentation and staff are uniquely fun. We attended a private party held for a friend who is a true foodie and they created a truly wonderful evening. They also did a terrific job taking care of those with special dietary requests. With so many great restaurants in the city, this one stands out as uniquely special."

Lazy Bear,50,"Stunning culinary experience, amazing service","I have been lucky enough to eat in a number of Michelin-rosette restaurants over the years, but this was the finest dining experience I've had anywhere in the USA. The whole experience was wonderful and seemed beautifully orchestrated to not just give you memories of fine dining but of an overall ""experience"".    There are two seatings per day and we chose the later one, which started at 8.30pm. We arrived a few minutes early to find the main dining room in full swing with the previous sitting. We were taken upstairs to the mezzanine floor where we had a view over the dining room and were given a cocktail. A few minutes later, right on time, the first of 5 tiny introductory courses was served and we were off. There were 5 courses upstairs, ranging from a glass of whipped scrambled eggs, through a unique oyster, some lamb tartare (which was about the best lamb I'd ever tasted), a glass of rhubarb soda and a softshell crab. All were completely memorable and striking.    Then it was time to go down to the main room where we were seated and prepared for the main event. You all sit along two large tables and the idea is you talk to the people on either side too, as that's all part of the experience. I was there with my wife and two teenage sons to celebrate various family milestones. We enjoyed talking to the others and then the main chef and owner came out and gave a small introduction, plus introducing the first course downstairs, which was... bread and butter! But not just any bread and butter. This really was worthy of being a course in its own right and we loved it.    Meanwhile, we had chosen the paired wines and I want to mention that both the choice of wines and the attentiveness of the service was the best I've ever experienced. Wonderful, interesting and appropriate wines and amazing attentiveness so that your glass was never empty. There are even soft drink pairings for non-alcohol consuming members of the party and one of my sons enjoyed those.    One of the key aspects of the experience is that food is prepared in the kitchen which is part of the main room, so you can go right up to where the kitchen area starts and watch, and interact with the kitchen and waiting staff, who were universally friendly and well-informed.    Each time a new course came out the chef responsible would give an entertaining little introduction and explain it - it really added to the experience. The following courses involved halibut, beets with foie gras (which was about the tastiest thing I've ever experienced), king salmon, grilled porcini and rack of lamb. The portions were all tiny (which is perhaps just as well when you are eating 12 of them) but the flavors so intense that you were never left feeling either hungry or overfed. One of the attentions to detail I particularly liked was the way the waiting staff checked that the teenage boys, one of whom had played 3 games of water polo that day, had enough, and provided extra bread and extra lamb servings exactly when appropriate.    Then there were two memorable desserts plus some ""treats"" - all perfectly chosen to complement the experience. Finally, after we'd been chatting to him at the kitchen area, the main chef offered us a kitchen tour, which was also very enjoyable.    It has to be said that at this price it's hard to say a place like this is good value for money, but as a world-class experience my whole family will remember the rest of our lives, perhaps that's exactly what it is. Either way, I'd love to do it again."

Lazy Bear,50,Excellent,"I dream of going “back to the bear”.  The food is excellent, locally sourced, artfully prepared, lovingly served. I’ve now been multiple times, private party, early seating, late seating. Each offers a unique experience, but none was radically better than the other.  I highly recommend the upgraded wine pairing. Each time they have served some extraordinary hide to find gems."

Lazy Bear,50,wonderful experience,"Some Michelin restaurants experience in China, so I did not expect too much on this one. However, as soon as I walked in, I thought this one might be difference. The following food proved my thought, and each dish is art. I have never eat the bread plus butter like that. Everyone who have plan to San Francisco should go there, especially the friends from China."

Lazy Bear,50,Honeymoon visit,"Thanks to all at Lazy Bear for giving my husband and I such a fantastic evening tonight. Front row seats to watch the action, a sweet card celebrating our recent elopement, and last but not least-a phenomenal meal. Creative, confident, bold flavors throughout the meal. We opted for the alcohol-free drink tasting and were wowed by the unique pairings as well. Very memorable evening!  Highlights-egg custard, oyster,white asparagus, rhubarb drink, buttermilk soda, trout and pea, artichoke with shellfish broth, honey dessert,gummy bear, cold brew coffee."

Lazy Bear,50,Delicious meal in SF,"The experience here was really out of this world! Before dinner you are seated upstairs, with a beautiful view of the restaurant, served appetizers and drinks, and are then taken downstairs to the communal dining room. Each meal is served with an explanation by a chef, outlining what it is, how it's made, and how to eat it. The wait staff is incredibly attentive. The food is served beautifully, and is delicious. In fact, my friend and I found their homemade bread so delicious that we both were laughing that the was the high bread point of our lives, as we were doubtful we'd ever find anything better. Their iced coffee was unlike anything I've ever tasted. The experience and the food were well worth the money. I would do it again, and it was an amazing first night in San Francisco thanks to this place!"

Lazy Bear,50,Probably THE BEST restaurant and culinary experience EVER,"Thomas Keller might just kill us, but Lazy Bear IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST food and experience we have encountered in our 50+ years as foodie type folks!  From the beginning with cocktails in the upstairs lounge overlooking the dining room and kitchen with multiple bites to a very curated and interactive (communal seating and being close-up with the kitchen and staff) downstairs, we two couples were blown away!  The spelt rolls and buttermilk butter, salmon, lamb chop, veggies and on and on, with multiple dessert bites and wine choices were spectacular.  DO: Go hungry, cause you will eat it ALL! The rub, very hard to reserve and pricey $300 pp+.  DON'T: Y'all go and steal our reservation, ya hear?!"

Lazy Bear,40,Great dining experience,"We tried Lazy Bear for a special dinner last night. First of all, great service. Everyone had appetizers upstairs, before we escorted to the communal dining tables downstairs. Good quality food with great presentation. Definitely worth going at least once for a special occasion, or to treat yourself for a gear meal and dining experience."

Lazy Bear,40,Interesting Concept,"I'll be going against the grain here, but I do not think this restaurant deserves 2 Michelin stars. Interesting and fun concept: Yes. Good service: Yes. Very limited wine list from obscure wineries which is a negative. The food was beautifully presented and tasteful but not out of this world. Good to try but not a must."

Lazy Bear,50,Fun adventurous dining,What is not to love about Lazy Bear; the loft starters and aperitif foreshadow the food to follow - adventurous and creative. The community table is a fun experience. The staff are professional and their passion to provide you with seamless fine dining service reflects well. Don’t cheat yourself out of their wine pairing- well worth the add and thoughtfully pairs well with each course.

Lazy Bear,30,Disappointed,"My husband and I were so looking forward to this dinning experience. Unfortunately we were both disappointed. All the dishes were executed beautifully, wait staff was fabulous, and the atmosphere was very warm and chic. The food was the issue. Lazy Bear focused too much on “sea” themed dishes last night. Almost every course came from the sea or lake.( scallops, trout, abalone, oyster, and caviar topped so many dishes). My husband and I both enjoy seafood, this was over load. And neither of us love caviar, but we are willing to try it in different settings. But over and over and over is a little much. Honestly the duck course, Apple course and the abalone were the best items on the menus last night. The “dumplings “ topped with caviar and sea grass was way briney. If Lazy Bear would diversify their nightly selections, with a few “land meat” choices it would be almost perfect."

Lazy Bear,50,"Epicurious, do it!","This place hits all the marks, service, atmosphere, experience. Arrive early and enjoy some cocktails upstairs and socialize with the other diners. From start to finish this was a 2 star Michelin experience you won't regret."

Lazy Bear,40,Wow - food matches the experience - but could be better,"4 snacks; 8 courses; petit fours of exquisite food. But that is not even half the story - you are here for the experience. Open kitchen, encouraged interactivity with the chefs; food served to the communal tables at once; each course introduced by the chef. Services is brilliant and by staff who are obviously proud to be working there. The food itself is innovative in concept (much has been foraged, and home preserved). The dishes develop over years with concepts from earlier menus being developed with the an extra smoked ingredient, or some infusion that has been made.    But, its incredibly labour intensive serving perhaps 50 people all at once, particularly when you are offering a drinks package with each course (an incredible value drinks package, with numerous little top ups). This means that to make money, you have to have two sittings. We were at the earlier sitting (6pm for snacks; 6.30pm for tasting menu and out by 8.25pm), and we felt that the service was rushed. We could have done with more time to digest the food (both literally, and with the people around us). It would be better to drop one dish, shave a bit off the price and take it more leisurely.    Usually, you can also go back upstairs to further digest the meal (again both meanings) but the night we went, there was a private party following so we had to leave. If we had known we couldn't linger when we booked, we would have chosen another evening."

Lazy Bear,50,Well worth it for our special day,"This was definitely all about the experience. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with congratulations as it was our wedding day today. We were seated in a special ""love seat"" upstairs where the snacks and drinks began. We were then seated at the communal tables, met our fellow diners and the meal began. At every course, a chef introduced the course and explained the details behind it. The highlights were the bread roll and butter, king salmon, corn and the mushrooms. The quality of the food, service and the experience was all well worth the price tag. Highly recommend for a special occasion."

Lazy Bear,40,Aspiring For Excellence But Falling Short,"This super-expensive restaurant has a number of innovative features--e.g. a separate area upon arrival for 30+ minute opening drinks and amuse bouches, a small notebook to record food tasting notes, communal announcements as each course is being served. And some of the 9-10 small courses are sublime.  But flaws abound. The separate arrival area does not have room for all the sit. Plastic chairs at a communal table, all courses served at the same time to all like a banquet-leaving slower eaters gasping, succulent lamb meat but half fat, opening tidbits over-salted while salmon later on needed salt. Also the loudness of the music is offputting for such a fine restaurant.  Most egregiously, the premium wine pairing was a disaster--the sommelier tries to show off by serving obscure selections many of which--especially the whites were weak."

Lazy Bear,50,The Bear no Longer Hibernates!,"The bear hunted, the bear ate, the bear slept! But have no fear the, bear has awoken! Please go see Chef David produce interesting/ creative tasting menus. hear the story behind the dish. Dine at long communal tables with strangers, it is enthralling. Captivating. Subtle yet bursting with flavor. Ingredients are true yet enigmatic. Believe in what they do, believe in what they serve, believe in how they offer. Expensive is the only qualm. However precious enough to delight!"

Lazy Bear,50,Excellent dining experience,"but not uniformly. This is a fine dining great experience. You start with four snacks in the upstairs balcony. Then you go down to the communal two dining tables. The kitchen is open and the chef welcomes everyone and invites everyone to get up during the dinner to visit the kitchen and view the next course being created. Our 9 course dinner started with a fluffy roll and home cultured butter that was cheese-like. Excellent complex dishes included king salmon, sungold tomato, corn grits with truffle, grilled lamb rack, and blackberry tart. Very good courses were nectarine dessert, melon, and pork cheeks. Each course is introduced by a different chef. The service is excellent. Dinner is around $180+20%=tax per person,. Disappointing was the wine pairings at $95 +20%+tax = about $125. Only three of nine were very good. Three others average and three not good. Nevertheless, wine service was enthusiastic. Great for a very special evening."

Californios,50,Simply SUPERB in Every Way! A Must Visit.,"I can’t wait to visit Californios a third time. It was so good the first time in 2022 that on a trip last month I invited a friend to join me. From start to finish WOW! We were both super impressed. Creative, fresh, visually stunning and above all TASTY food, with superb drinks pairing and exceptional service, who could ask for anything more. My favorites were the ceviche, potato soup with caviar and, once again, the unmatchable trio of tacos. If you’re in or visiting San Francisco, this restaurant elevates Mexican food to an culinary art form and is a must for any foodie."

Californios,50,Spectacular,"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Californios last night. It was hands down one of the best meals I can recall enjoying. Every single course was very delicious and creatively and beautifully presented. The service was outstanding. There were 15 courses and I was worried whether I would be able to finish it all--I am a small person--but the portions are just right and I made it to the end with a smile. I particularly loved the cod taco, the potato soup, the quail, the venison, and the chocolate dessert. We had eaten before at their Mission location, which was cozy and dark, so this new space was unexpectedly fabulous. High ceilings, colorful paintings, large plants, comfortable seating, very spacious. Absolutely loved the vibe. I honestly enjoyed this more than the French Laundry. It is pricey but for all that we received it felt like an excellent value. Definitely going to come back."

Californios,20,Overpriced,"My wife and I went for our anniversary to celebrate the occasion expecting a Mexican cuisine.    As far as I could taste, the main touch was Latin American not Mexican as they are presented in their website. They introduce Ceviche in the menu which is Peruvian, Arepas which are Venezuelan/Colombian and the main dish is Japanese Wagyu just to give few examples.    On top of that, pairing comes with Spanish, French and Italian wines which was not expected for a Mexican menu. However, tacos were delicious.    We were expecting more from a two Michelin star restaurant at 1,400$ price for two."

Californios,50,"Brilliant cooking, should rely on that instead of luxury ingredients","We opted for the wine pairing with special tour, got shown around the kitchen and wine cellar. we later learned it was the first night they did this; it was a little awkward but I loved it all the same. First, the cooking at this restaurant is absolutely top tier. Highly creative, but not gratuitously eccentric. Every single thing that came to the table had beautiful contrasts but also perfect balance. Chilis were used in most courses but never at the expense of balance. One dish consisted of tomato water (umami bomb!) plus a sort of tuna ceviche or aguachile in strawberry juice, plus a trio of three different melon slices, each with a uniqut tajin. Every. Single. Bite of this dish was deligihtful: the tajins enhanced the melons. The strawberry, whlie shocking, was a thought-compelling dressing for the tuna. And the tomato water was, well as good as tomato water gets (i.e. extremely tasty). Each element enhanced the others. The big finish was a shocking large portion of A5 Wagyu beef served with an impossibly delicious sauce based on squash seeds. My only complaint on this course was that there was too much meat! A5 is very rich, and while finally succeeded, it was not easy to polish off the whole serving. Things they could do that might merit a third Michelin star: staff should be more personally knowledgeable about the menu (the service overall was great, but we've come to expect all servers to know the whole menu). Wines were presented with what seemed to be rehearsed speeches about what to expect. This was not really necessary, but was also unconvincing. These canned offerings were in lieu of actual personal knowledge about the qualities of the wines, and of deeper knowledge about their provenance. Finally, there were a LOT of prestige items in the menu: caviar, wagyu beef...As if (this is pure conjecture) someone felt a need to justify spending such a sum for what could (by the ignorant) be dismissed as mere Mexican food. It is Mexican, using a lot of ingredients and techniques familiar to most people, AND the quality is among the best I've ever had. Now I enjoy caviar and Wagyu beef at least as much as the next guy, but I saw these luxuty items as a bit of distraction away from the genius of the cooking. One other thing: The music was too loud. Despite all this nit-picking, I strongly recommend this restaurant. Can't wait to go back!"

Californios,50,Perfect Experience,"I delighted in the tasting menu and the wine pairing at Californios. It was simply perfection!    Creative, approachable and delicious — there were a few dishes and ingredients that initially met me with apprehension — only to be wowed and moved by the innovation and symphony of flavors. This is a two-star menu that I could experience over and over again and never grow tired.    The service was meticulous, fun and relatable."

Californios,50,Cultural immersion through authentic and intense familial flavors. Mexican Cuisine at Its Finest!!,"There is no doubt in my mind that Californios is elevated Mexican cuisine at its finest with service to match!!! So many unique flavors and tasty combinations I can’t pick a favorite, though the 3 different type of tacos stood out. The fish and beef dishes were amazing and the sommelier’s choices were spot on. I haven’t seen their old location but the current space is chic, elegant and well laid out. Top-notch professional and friendly service all around. Whether it’s for a special occasion or a dinner out, Californios is the perfect spot for fine dining and well worth the price!!    PS-Given it’s new location (355 11th St) TripAdvisor and Californios needs to update their listing."

Californios,50,Needs more national attention,"What I'm comparing it against: fine dining experiences in major cities.    Overview: A 2-star Michelin restaurant and also one of the few restaurants to have 4 stars from the SF Chronicle. Elevated Mexican fare in prix fixe format only. TOCK reservations only.    Vibe: Located in the Mission District, an area with a lot Latin/Hispanic culture, small artsy shops (including a wonderful fragrance shop called TigerLily), and a lot of wall art. In short, very different from the Union Square area. The restaurant itself is extremely small and intimate (a good thing). Dark, nice wall art, and a younger yet refined feel compared to places like Le Bernardin and Benu. Also, no classical music, but instead things like Ivy, The Smiths, and other 80s and 90s alt-rock and new wave. No dress code, but you want to dress up to some extent.    I was at the Chef’s Counter. At other counters (like D.C.’s Pineapples & Pearls, for example), you marvel at how technical, orderly, and spacious the kitchen is. Californios’ kitchen, on the other hand, provides a different yet rewarding experience. It is much more intimate and closer, and the area where 4-5 chefs work seems almost cramped (but I don’t say this negatively). I just don’t know how they work effectively, but they do. What’s really fun to watch is the code-worded communication between all of them (think Peyton Manning as he’s communicating with the offense pre-snap). In other words, you don’t understand what’s being said; you only know that you’ll enjoy the outcome.    Food: Wonderful, and the 2 Michelin stars is the appropriate rating. Elevated Mexican fare with a variety of meats, sauces, etc. You can also order an additional wine/beverage pairing (I just ordered a couple glasses a la carte). I believe the sommelier was at the French Laundry before coming to Californios. Several courses but I was not overly full (which was an issue at Benu the previous night).    Service: Absolutely wonderful and genuinely warm—that applies to hosts, servers, and the chefs working under the Head Chef.    Long story short—such a wonderful experience. I’d love to come here again someday (all the way from Virginia!). Covid-19 is temporary, but great food is forever. I hope the staff there is doing okay during this time.    I would have posted 12 or so pics, but this website freezes every time I try, so you just get text from me I guess."

Californios,40,Amazing meal but very expensive!,"Three of us dined here one evening over the Christmas period, and it was definitely an 'experience'!    Firstly, you should be aware that you have to pay in full in advance and have to choose your 'slot' when booking from pre-defined sittings - totally to be expected with such a complex menu from a small restaurant where one table of 'no shows' would be a real problem. Also, the restaurant itself is very discreetly set back from the street with blacked-out doors so it is a bit of a surprise at first to walk straight into the small dining area on arrival, with a full view of the chef's station along one side of the room and a lot of staff milling around the small space.    We arrived right on time, but had to stand around a little awkwardly in the doorway as our table was not ready and other guests were already waiting on the small bench seating/waiting area.    Our coats were taken, a complimentary sparkling aperitif offered and after about ten minutes waiting we were shown to our table. This was not a major issue as there was plenty to look at while we were waiting as the chefs were preparing other diner's plates on the pass in front of us. The staff were all very friendly and looked after us extremely well throughout the evening; it was just not the slick start we expected from this standard of restaurant.    We were each given a 'gift', which was the evening's menu in an envelope so we could choose whether or not to see what was coming (we chose not to 'sneak peak', and each dish was introduced separately by the staff as it arrived). We also each chose to have the drinks pairing with the meal, which was a fascinating selection of wines, cider, champagne, madeira, sake......I really enjoyed trying the different drinks with the dishes, but if you like red wine you may wish to order your own bottle as there was only one glass of red offered in the selection that we had.    The dishes themselves were absolutely knock-out amazing; mostly small bites (some were two bites - we were helpfully informed by the waiting staff how many bites to use on each one!). There were many ingredients used that we had never tried before, and with my view of the pass the immense care that the (mostly young) chefs paid to every plate was a joy to watch. Whether we actually enjoyed each dish or not is obviously down to personal taste, but very little went back from our table. Each dish was presented on it's own carefully thought-out plate, and cutlery was kept to the minimum (most of these dishes were 'finger food' size and you are expected to eat with your hands). The attention to detail in the dishes was second to none, and it was very reassuring to see the head chef at the top of the pass inspecting every single dish before it went out.    Stand-out dishes for me were an airy sea urchin delight, delightful little sticky rib tacos and the beautifully-made ice cream and chocolates. The only dish I struggled with was the plantain tamale which seemed to be all about the theatre and not about the substance - the truffles and caviar it came with were virtually tasteless. However, this is down to personal opinion and others may think differently!    The plates were put before us in quick succession with no long waits between courses, even so the whole meal took nearly three hours which seemed to whizz by - it was so exciting to see what would come out next.    There were a few 'niggles' - our table was in a fierce draught, and we had to ask twice for the aircon to be adjusted (otherwise I would have had to ask for my coat back as it was so cold on one side), we also had to ask for our table water to be topped up a few times which was disappointing as there seemed to be a gentleman who's only job it was was to pour water and the restaurant was not that big! There was also a slight muddle at one point where new cutlery, glasses and plates appeared and then suddenly disappeared again as the course sequence was obviously lost for a moment - but it was a busy evening and these things happen. There is also only one small, rather dark unisex restroom so you had to time your 'bathroom breaks' carefully - the staff were happy to let you know when it was free though.    At over GBP £1000 for three people (with the drinks pairing and a bottle of sparkling water, plus tea/coffee), there is no denying that this is a very extravagant evening's dining. I found it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Would I go back? No, because I could not justify the cost and I consider it a 'one-off' treat. Would I recommend it? Absolutely, if you can afford it - the opportunity to try all these amazing dishes at the world's only two Michelin starred Mexican restaurant is definitely one not to be missed.    PS. If you don't think you like Mexican food, don't worry - there wasn't a refried bean in sight!"

Californios,50,Excellent in all aspects,Very refined and yet super delicious The tasting menu is made of 20 plus small tapas like bite size dishes Excellent selection of fine wines The full course takes around 2 and half hours with very attentive services Well worth every penny

Californios,50,Getting even Better,This was our second visit to Californios and it was even better than our first. We spent three enjoyable hours that felt like an hour devouring 20+ delectable offerings from the kitchen. Service was very efficient and friendly.    If you want to try sophisticated Mexican at its finest this is the place in SF.    One suggestion: avoid the wine pairing. You would do better ordering off their wine list which is comprehensive and fairly priced.

Californios,40,Trying Hard,"In a city with quite a number of self important, $200+ per meal prix fixe menu restaurants, Californios has its work cut out for it trying to produce authentic Mexican food with local Bay Area ingredients. Further, the diner has to decide if eating Mexican is worth $200+. This is a fair question, because in Mexico City, it certainly is and dining is on a high international levels Californios has its work cut out for it.  In many instances the small plate creations are really exceptional and you will long remember them. Some courses are just average, but on the whole the dining experience is worth the effort and the service and chef detail exceptional."

Californios,50,Fabulous Mexican tasting menu experience with a very fun and enthusiastic team—for a steal of a price!,"We enjoyed dinner at Californios for the second night of our annual culinary weekend in San Francisco. And what a Mexican dinner it is! We’ve dined at Taco Maria in Costa Mesa and at Pujol, Quintonil, and Biko in Mexico City, and this was right up there with the best of them. The food was truly sublime and authentically Mexican, the timing and service were wonderful, and the atmosphere was relaxed and convivial while still exuding a sense of chic sexiness. The wine pairings weren’t perfect, but they were all very good—with a few mind-blowing and one that was a bit off for us.    The entire service team here was an absolute blast—we really enjoyed getting to know them and interact with them in a way that is unusual for us at such fine dining. They knew their stuff about the food and wine, but they had fabulous senses of humor and genuinely appreciated our inquisitiveness and our curiosity. They even took note that we hadn’t loved the one wine pairing, in particular, and suggested our feedback was the reason they might change it. We really had fun here as much as an amazing dinner. A rare dinner, indeed!    Our entire meal was a mere $341, including both our menus and both of us having the wine pairing. That is an absolute steal for a 2* Michelin meal in this city or in most places! We absolutely loved it and can not wait to return.    Kudos to one of our new favorites! We loved it all and loved all of them!"

Californios,10,All hat and no cattle,"Comically pretentious. Food is under seasoned and not delicious. Wine pairing portions are skimpy and lots of talk about where the wine comes from while the portion barely covers the bottom of the glass. Worst of all the fish dish was so rotten and smelly we had to send it back and never received an apology or even an acknowledgment and the bill for four of us was close to a thousand dollars! If you want a delicious meal in San Francisco go,to The Progress on Fillmore street."

Californios,50,"Creative, authentic, distinctive, impeccable service, atmosphere for those that really want to find treasures.",Rarely do you find a restaurant that does it all. The 16 course menu is one gem after another in just the right order and each dish is unique and brings out another taste that continues to build during the amazing service and engagement that everyone including the family members brings to the meal. The space is luxuriously comfortable in the Mission but provides the perfect accompaniment to the food. Even the utensils and the plates surprise you course after course but have brilliant minds behind them all. Wine compliments each serving or select from a wine list the reflects the same degree of perfection. This is Mexican cuisine and imagination taken to a level that won't be matched.

Californios,50,Explosion on your taste buds!,"This review is LONG overdue. I had dined here back in February with my sister and our husbands, in celebration of Valentine's Day. Due to traffic, we were arrived a few minutes late (which I hate), but the host was extremely nice and welcoming. Now walking into the restaurant, it's like walking into someone's kitchen with the dining area right in the same spot. It's that intimate...and we loved it! To be in a dining space where the decor is very hip and classy, while being privy to the hustle and bustle of the chefs right behind really set the tone for what was coming.    And the food!!! I was very anxious to see how Mexican flavors can translate to a menu in the style presented and from the get-go, it was one burst of complex and beautiful flavors after another. The courses flowed really well, from the savory tastes, through the vegetables, into the black cod and carne asada and with a beautiful finish of sweet (the churro w/ foie gras was certainly bold and fun, but the apple dessert course is still something burned in y brain). The service was impeccable - hosts were constantly checking in on our drinks, making sure that our glasses were filled with whatever we needed at all times. Fantastic experience, accolades are well-deserved. Cannot wait to go again."

Californios,50,"Great flavours, presentation and service",2 Star restaurant serving modern Mexican.    Small dining space makes for an intimate experience with the counter seats overlooking the open kitchen my top choice.    Impeccable and friendly service. All the staff and chefs were friendly and happy to chat with the solo diner.    The food was packed with flavour and beautifully presented. I could not fault a single dish. The Uni taco and Wagyu beef were standout highlights but every dish met a very high standard.    I highly recommend this restaurant in San Francisco.

Californios,40,Different and exciting,The dishes were so unique and delicious. I love to eat but just too much food for me as I was too full to really enjoy the last part of the menu.

Californios,50,Outstanding cuisine and services ! Bravo!!,This was a great surprise. Impeccable hosting and quality. Impressive presentation of the dishes and unimaginable food taste. Californios took the leading position on our list of top Michelin restaurants.

Californios,40,Interesting taste-menu,"Sat at the chefs-table, amazing to see the work they put in in every plate. Ended up with 19 different dishes, for me that was maybe 5 too many. Too full to enjoy the last ones. Great way to celebrate my birthday!"

Californios,50,One of the meals of my life,"This must be one of the best restaurants, not only in SF, but in the whole of Calfornia, including most of the three start Michelin restaurants. Not only does it have a feeling of luxury once you pass the front door and is met by the most corteuos staff you could ever wish for, but the meal is at the same time deeply traditional, wildly inventive and just plain tasteful. Not once in a meal consisting of 15? courses do you get anything that is not rooted in tradition, either Mexican or south Californian, or where innovativeness is prioritized on behalf of taste and texture. Eating tortillas and tacos will never be the same again. The wine menu consists mostly of quite unknown wines, but they all match the courses perfectly. A mexican bubbly wine served with the entrees was just smakshing, just to mention one example. Tankfully, most beverages in the wine menu is just that - wine - and only one beer is served with a rather hot soup and some courses dominated by hot chili. Service is perfect and friendly. Expect to pay about 300 USD, and although it is not quite a bargain, it is a good deal. Reminds me of some of the best Scandinavian restaurants like Maeemo, Geranium or Noma, only based in a totally different culinary tradition."

Californios,50,"Gracious service, delicious and creative menu and sophisticated interior","My husband and I celebrated our 70th birthdays and had an amazing meal. The space is sophisticated with dark paneling, colorful art, comfortable tufted banquette seating and pillows for added comfort (there are also 6 seats at the bar where you can watch the chefs in the kitchen but we opted for comfort and privacy). Everyone who served us was knowledgeable about the food and wines (we included the wine pairing with our meal) and made us feel welcome. Our December 2, 2017 menu (which is presented after the meal ends to allow the servers to guide you through each delectable plate) reflects 19 items ranging from horchata to start and a digestif to finish. Every plate was an artistic presentation, flavors were unique, ingredients were excellent. Some of my favorites included the dried scallop chicharron, the mushroom tortilla, the lobster taco, the awesome bone broth (incredibly flavorful), the three beans with tiny caviar and gold leaf flecks as part of the presentation, the incredibly tender and flavorful wagyu beef and the squab breast. That's not to say the other dishes were mediocre - they were absolutely wonderful, too. The wine pairings complemented the dishes very well; many of the wines were from Europe (France, Germany, Spain and Portugal) and were interesting on their own and even better with the foods. The pairings weren't limited to wine as we had an artisanal ale (from Michigan) and a fermented cider from France. Our meal seemed a bit fast paced to begin, but the entire experience extended over 3 hours, so be prepared to savor each plate. Yes, this is an expensive meal, but if you are looking for an outstanding dining experience that is both exquisite in presentation, flavor and spot-on service, then try to score tickets to this 2-star Michelin restaurant."

Californios,50,Highly recommended fine dining,"A restaurant with nondescript facade that serves impeccable high class dinner on a set menu – that is Californios, San Francisco in a nut shell. The dining experience of over 3 hours was surprisingly well taken. Each item in the 18-course dinner was served with an explanation of its ingredients and cooking methodology and heightened our appreciation of the food. The selection of wines was excellent and paired very well with the food. The chef also came to the table for closer contact. All the dishes were so palatable as to beggar description. Although its not an inexpensive place, it is highly recommended if you want to experience what fine dining is all about."

Californios,50,Outstanding,"Meticulously executed, super inventive, haute Mexican. No misses on our night from this kitchen. The wine pairing was excellent with my wife and I loving all but maybe 2 selections. If you're seriously considering going then by all means don't miss this most excellent and inventive restaurant. Dress among other diners wasn't nearly as upscale as I anticipated with a few t-shirts. Vibey decor with clubby music, but not loud. Small room with an entirely open kitchen on the side. Unassuming building in a very down to Earth neighborhood. So happy to have chosen Val Cantu's super enjoyable cuisine."

Californios,50,amazing place pushing boundaries,"this place was amazing, the attention to detail, thoughtfulness and care that went into every dish was simply beautiful!  keep an open mind about each course and enjoy it for what it is.  the tasting menu is a good 3 hour experience and is a wonderful journey!  we sat at the chef counter and the staff was extraordinarily skilled and happy to talk about each dish presented.  anybody who gave this place a bad review just didn't get it!"

Californios,50,If I could give 10 stars!,"I have eaten in a fair number of good restaurants; several being Michelin star. This restaurant tops them all. I consider the meal we had here one of the highlights of my life and will be talking about it forever. There were 19 courses; each one memorable, delicious, superbly presented and appropriately proportioned. I can't believe I walked out of there not feeling over fed. Even the dishes used were unique. And the service; the best I have ever experienced. My son and family treated us to this meal so I have no idea of the cost but whatever it was, it was worth it. I loved it!!"

Californios,50,Amazing...,"The interior is luxe, the food is refined and the service is impeccable. It’s small and personal, with just 22 seats divided between tables and a chef’s counter. Everything feels carefully thought out form the black wood and leather interiors to the modern selection of paintings and a selection of music that manages to veer from hip hop classics to 70s pop.    The meal consists of a seven-course tasting menu, which can be adjusted to accommodate vegetarians or other requirements.    We started out with agua fresca – a tart/sweet blend of strawberry and celery juices, with a cilantro puree that rose up slowly from the bottom.    What followed was beautifully plated dish after beautifully plated dish of delightful interpretations of Mexican dishes. The corn and rice chip with fermented pepper puree was a particular highlight –rich, smoky and unctuous. I could happily have gorged myself on a bowl of this umami delight.    D"

Californios,50,Great experience,Fantastic experience. A twist on Mexican food. We travel only for gastronomy experiences. This place was the best one in San Francisco.

Californios,20,Tedious,"I will agree with other reviewers that many of the dishes show imagination and the presentation is good.    But most of the dishes just didn't taste that good. Lobster in an apple peel cone sounds imaginative, but all I tasted was the apple. An uni dish with peas hardly had any flavor. One green taco was oily, and seemed a lot of trouble for the mash which was inside (which I never identified). As for the concluding meat dishes, the braised Wagyu was just okay, and gave no sense of Wagyu-ness, unlike a char-broiled Wagyu (also in a lengthy tasting menu) I had a month ago at Amber, a 3-Michelin star restaurant in Hong Kong. The very last meat dish, stewed lamb, was sour and bitter, and all the lamb flavor was smothered by the very heavy seasoning.    The wine-pairing seemed haphazard. It is probably really hard to match most of these dishes, but then they shouldn't offer a pairing.    My bill for one came to $330, including the 10% city tax and the compulsory 20% service charge. The total bill struck me as expensive relative to what I got. The restaurant is very small, about 30 seats, and considering the number of cooks in evidence, it must be difficult to survive financially, leading to such a price level, which greatly exceeds that of many 2-3 Michelin-starred restaurants I have dined at in Manhattan, except for Eleven Madison Park (see my review), which with the standard pairing costs exactly $450, all-in, and well worth it."

Californios,50,really an amazing meal,"So, I have now been here twice, most recently 2 nights ago. Both times a really wonderful dining experience. The restaurant is very small and almost hard to find in the Mission. The staff were exceptional. It is a no-choice multiple course meal and we also did the wine pairing. Maybe 15 courses, most small and fish/Mexican focused. 8 wines. Sounds like a lot but every course worth it. Chef came out for a few. Tables far enough apart that sound/privacy was good.  Definitely worth it for foodies/special occasions.  Downside - not Saison pricey, but with wine and included tip 325 pp. They are planning to start selling reservations a la Alinea...not sure how that will fly.  Highly recommend."

Melisse,50,Spectacular! Perhaps my new favorite in LA,"Our Los Angeles anniversary weekend’s final dinner at 2* Melisse in Santa Monica was absolute perfection. What an amazing meal. I can’t believe it’s taken us this long to try! We loved almost every single course, and too many to count were mind blowingly good. The wine pairings — unusually both white and red for every course or group of courses — were both avant-garde in approach and yet completely fulfilling and delightful. Every wine pairing was fantastic, and yet the two wine approach let us enjoy elements we otherwise might have missed. I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.    The team was as effortlessly entertaining as they were professional. Service was fantastic — with the single caveat of the early arrival bar seating being a bit oddly done. We adored the sommelier and a few servers, and really enjoyed getting to know them a bit better as much as the food and wine.    We absolutely loved it. Way better for us than wildly overrated Providence. We definitely will return."

Melisse,10,"TERRIBLE! $1500 for 4, SERVICE HORRIBLE, HEATER BROKEN, only outdoors!","Horrible experience. They have prices of 5 star restaurant but not worth even 1 star.  1) Setting is in parking lot next to ugly apartment building. No charm, no class!  2) Currently only outdoors tables, very cold at night.  3) Charge $35/person cancellation so you go even on cold night.  4) Only 1 heater per table, have no extra heaters. Ours didn't work, were freezing all night.  5) Online menu (which had my favorite veggie dish) is different from the one at the restaurant, (which didn't). Menu was confusing, poorly explained.  6) We are vegetarian and they had told me on phone they had vegetarian menu. Not true, they only had one dish of pasta or risotto . That's it.  7) If 1 person wants 4 course menu, then the whole table is forced to order 4 courses.  8) They brought me my first 2 courses at same time. When I asked them to keep one warm, they told me to keep it at the table.  9) Food was ok but not hot and definitely not worth the price.  10) Service was HORRIBLE! Waiters were standing at entrance, chatting with each other, ignoring us. Spent my Birthday evening freezing and frustrated by not getting help.  11) The bill was $1500, that's about 4x of what we had expected when we decided to go there! Surcharges here and there that had not been explained when we ordered. We were shocked. It was MOST DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT. It wasn't worth $100.  12) Talked to the manager about it, she was SUPER RUDE. Said our heater didn't work, they only have 1 heater per table and have no extra. She didn't care, didn't want to hear my complaint, didn't offer anything. We've been to a lot of excellent restaurants and this definitely isn't one of them.  13) At those prices you must have good service. Ambience. Working and extra heaters. WE'LL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!"

Melisse,50,Take put menu,The food is superb and the take out dinners are fabulous and worth every penny ( or $$$$). Easy to heat up at home .

Melisse,10,Don't eat there,"I am writing to alert you to never go to their restaurant. We went there at 6pm with the understanding that nothing could be guaranteed as far as a booth or their seating.; When we arrive, we saw the restaurant was empty and requested a booth. What we were told was they weren’t available yet there were patrons sitting at booth (2 to the booth). After questing the booth, the overly sensitive maitre d went to the owner and complained that we weren’t happy – he came out and snapped his fingers saying we should leave because we were being abusive to his staff; which we were more than happy to do. the restaurant is overpriced and the way we were treated was indefensible – especially from the snapping finger owner – The web site says they cannot guarantee any requests yet when we went there a couple (2) people were sitting at a booth. When we mentioned that the restaurant was empty and we wanted to have a booth; we were ceremoniously dismissed – This type of customer service is not expected from an over price restaurant – We have lived on Santa Monica for over 40+ year and can only say that this is indicative of the type of classless restaurant ownership that is unbecoming of Santa Monica – If you visit Santa Monica avoid this pace at all costs – It is pretentious and lacks any class due to a high end restaurant . The place isn’t worth you time or money."

Melisse,50,Ok. Melisse. Food is extraordinary.,"Ok. Melisse. Food is extraordinary. Service was perfect: Charming, funny and fully informational. What’s not to like? Well, a couple of things IMO. First, price. We had the tasting menu. With the wine pairings. 8 courses. Give or take a few parenthetical courses. $800+ per person with tip. Too much, IMO. I’m never a fan of pay first. Something wrong about that when we’re talking about this kind of quality and service. But kinda worth it. All of the preliminary ‘courses’ were sublime. The Waygu Tartare beggar’s purse w caviar, the Buri were wonderful. The uni cromesquis was unreal. The UFO oyster was great though I still think Wellfleet Oysters are sweeter. The Leek Chanawanmushu, Uni scrambled Egg and OsetraCaviar were unbelievably good. They followed that with Chesnut soup with whipped black truffle which was so good I was tempted to beg for seconds. The Hakkaido Scallop with warmed garlic,Tokyo Negi and Black Trumpets, the spiny lobster were reasons to contemplate another pass at begging for seconds. Kinmedai Sunchoke, porcini,w spinach was excellent. The quail, the lamb and the waygu were also excellent though at this point though by this point, while I wasnt full, I was starting to feel like I’d had enough. Not too much for dessert which was also extraordinary.Pinapple guava, passion fruit and Vanilla yogurt with a sensational wine ‘pairing’ of Galant de abbesses & 2018 Bugey Rose. The Wine pairings throughout this great meal went a long way towards earning that big price tag. Worth it? Yes. A really memorable and fine meal. All of the servers and the chef were doing everything they could to make sure we were happy campers. They succeeded!"

Melisse,50,"Excellent all around, Michelin Stars (2)","We had dinner here on 2/9/19. We were seated timely, the food was superb, and service excellent. The menu that night was prefix. We chose the 4 course because 7 or 10 sounded like a lot of food. The dinner lasts a long time...about 2 1/2 hours for ours. The only problem I had was that it was too filling...I just can't eat that much food anymore and I ended up all night with an upset stomach. I told my husband...no more prefix, I just can't handle it. It is a very special place, and very expensive. Check the menu before going so you know if you can afford it. Our bill was around $1000 for four."

Melisse,50,Special Occasions,"Honestly , I did not want to go BUT happily surprised with excellent service from start to finish great presentations of each dish and excellent experience for all . Four course is plenty and did not rush through our meal. Don’t care for 3% added to bill for health insurance but can tell them remove from bill. Definitely go back for special evenings."

Melisse,50,Joel’s Special Occasion Restaurant,"As locals, we enjoy dining at Melisse, Joel’s Special Occasion Restaurant, several times each year. As arguably Santa Monica’s Top gourmet restaurant, it’s reserved for those special times that we want to celebrate. Michelin starred, so pricing is commensurate. Enjoy that special occasion!"

Melisse,50,Spectacular!,From the moment you sit down you know this is going to be a unique and special experience. Our waiter Ryan and the entire staff make sure the guests are never left wanting. Every detail is attended too so that the water glasses are constantly filled and the bread plates are never empty. The cocktail menu is innovative and the 4 course dinner which sounds like it might not be enough was just perfect.  Each course is plated like a photo from gourmet magazine and explained in great detail by the Sous Chefs.  Be sure to add the cheese plate supplement which is a stunning addition and paired with a very special port. We spent almost 4 hours there sharing an unforgettable dining experience!

Melisse,50,Best meal of our three week holiday in California,"We came here on our wedding anniversary and were not disappointed! The restaurant had put a card and two little gifts on our table and the staff individually wished us a happy anniversary - so thoughtful. The food was fantastic and the service was outstanding. We are vegetarian and asked for the four course vegetarian tasting menu. There was no menu but the chef cooked for us taking into account our dislikes and allergies. There were 2 amuses bouches as well as 4 courses, around five choices of bread and two special drinks and petit fours. The price may seem high but for this quality of fine dining and service, it was well worth it. It is a shame to hear that the restaurant is being changed to a much smaller fine dining area as well as a lower cost restaurant. The city lacks fine dining restaurants of this quality!"

Melisse,40,"Good food, great sommelier, average staff","Beautiful displayed food, tasty. Decent food for price level but untrained staff left experience mixed. Wine list is expensive so I recommend telling sommelier much you want to spend and get half bottle. I think this restaurant would do well to have a bar that overlooks the kitchen or at least some access to the kitchen perhaps at the end of the meal or the beginning with a welcome Prosecco. This would enhance the experience. Bar could also offer bites that others could partake in that can’t afford the price. Staff need more training at this price level and prestige. Excited to try the restaurant post renovation."

Melisse,40,Traditional French in Santa Monica...,"Hit & Miss. The $40 glass of wine was tasty. So was the $30 glass. So that tells you this ain't a inexpensive night out. Reminds me of the Mansion at Turtle Creek in Downtown Dallas. Nice, good food, but I don't remember anything standing out like Boulet in NYC (gone!). Got the 4 tasting menu. Surprisingly filling, you will need to be very hungry for the 7 or 10 menus. The venison was outstanding. The foam on the pasta was weird, didn't really add to the taste that much. They said this was on the menu forever, so it's popular. There is a VEGAN tasting menu available, which I now regret not getting because I love how French cook vegetables. HINT HINT. Melissa is definitely for special occasions, couples or groups, not solo dinners, as there is no bar."

Melisse,50,"Great food, srtill being served with authority and finesse","Melisse has been one of the fine dining restaurants on the West Coast for 20 years. The food is immaculately prepared and served with style and elegance. The portions are properly sized so that the 7-course tasting menu which we had was a  perfect amount of food. The wine list is a little pricey (most wines over $100), but reasonable choices can be found.    It is probably not a restaurant one goes to one a week, but for special occasions,it cannot be beat."

Melisse,30,Slow Slide Continues,"Melisse is planning to close in — well, is it December, or ‘end of the year’, or now ‘in March’. They’re closing “for renovations” but not sure if they’re going to be back in the same location, or somewhere else. Huh?    Meanwhile, back at the dining room, it’s just not the same cutting edge vibe anymore and hasn’t been for a while. The food is still generally good but sometimes confusing and the service timing seems either too fast or too slow between courses, like they don’t have the same level of staffing.    Not sure that I’ll be back before the ‘renovations’ get underway."

Melisse,50,The Height of it All,"Melisse is a restaurant that sticks with you long after you have finished your last bite there. My last bite here actually occurred June 2016. To this day the meal is one of the top 5 restaurant experiences of my life. The moody atmosphere, refined service and incredible French cuisine all build a dining experience that is surpassed by none.    I'm not sure if it is still on the menu but the ""whole roasted black truffle chicken"" is something to behold. A beautifully brined chicken roasted whole with black truffles stuffed under its skin. The crispy truffle chicken was served with pomme puree, various squashes and mushrooms.    The dinner is expensive but in my opinion completely worth it."

Melisse,50,expensive but worth the splurge,"Excellent restaurant with multiple tasting menu options, professional but not stuffy service. The food from start to finish was oustanding. Extensive but expensive wine list. overall great service and wonderful food,expensive but worth the cost for special occasions,"

Melisse,40,Brilliant Restaurant in Santa Monica,In our view ticks all the boxes for high end restaurant. Great menu service and wine list in nice setting. Fully booked when went there on Wednesday night

Melisse,10,Still Sucks,"Went back for biz dinner. Thank God not on my credit card. Still over-priced and after a 20% tip, they still have the nerve to add 3% without your consent."

Melisse,50,Birthday Dinner,"The right place to celebrate important occasions. The amazing creativity of the chef and his crew is outstanding. We enjoyed every amuse-bouche, every appetizer and entree. The service is outstanding as well.We will be back!"

Melisse,40,"Great food, excellent service","Had a dinner presentation here. The restaurant does not have a sign that's easily distinguishable. The location is more of your landmark to know where it is since it is in the the corner of Wiltshire and 11th.  The salad dressing they used was the best I had ever tasted, including their selection of breads. The main meal (I ordered steak as my main entree) is properly cooked and has different degree of tastes of certain sweetness, sourness, and texture due to the sides that came with it. This is a restaurant where you needed to dress up and have a formal meal.  Overall, a very good experience. A plus, they have valet parking which is difficult to find in Santa Monica."

Melisse,50,Wonderful experi,"We enjoyed a lovely meal at Melisse.  We chose the 4 course meal but upgraded  for the Truffle Egg and for the Japanese Wagyu Beef. The service was great and the wine suggestion fantastic. The atmosphere was quiet but very comfortable. The bread was impossible to stop eating of which there were four types, basil, French  ciabatta and olive which along with the 2 types of butter from France.It was so good people! The Truffle Egg dish was the best thing we had. If you like truffles, then the upgrade will be money well spent. The warm Tomato Soup along with the Strawberry Sorbet was surprisingly satisfying.The Japanese Wagyu was very tasty and so was the Snake River Pork. While the meal was pricey, the food was so good and the dining experience so enjoyable that we would definitely return again."

Melisse,50,Nothing was better in my life !,I'm serious:) so perfect 👌 it was a symphony of 12 courses and wines... unforgettable and absolutely brilliant kitchen and service ! Maestro himself went out of kitchen for a while..

Melisse,50,Excellent! We went for the night of my 60th,"My wife booked for my 60 birthday celebration- it was brilliant.    We had a table for 6 and all took the four course chefs special with a wine choice from the sommelier. The food was exceptional and the advice on the wine "" on the button""    We all had a wonderful evening, we enjoyed the presentation style , particularly the explanation of each course, this added to the event.    Thank you to all the staff"

Melisse,30,It's OK,"We went for dine LA. The place is small, holds 12-15 tables. Do not sit near the window it gets hot in the summer.  We sat down and found my plate to be dirty. It took them awhile to give me clean dishes. The person walking around with bread did not stop at our table, when he finally did, the green rolls (basil) was all gone and took another 20 mins before it was available.  There were quite a few waiters but it took forever to be served or waited on.    The food was good but honestly, I have had better at Maemo in Norway or at providence in so cal.    We spent about $270 for two for the set menu - dine LA wine but no wine paring.  They have nice little stool to place your purse on.    Parking is $7 valet. No parking around. Street parking requires special pass.  Overall, I wouldn't go back there again."

Melisse,50,It's definitely a Michelin,"We reserve this restaurants for the top celebrations in our life, and then it is worth every dollar, every decadent morsel they serve you. Dining at the Melisse will stand out in your memory as one of the best culinary experiences of your life."

Melisse,50,THIS is a dining Experience!,"We had been here once before and went back for an anniversary dinner. It met or exceeded our memories of our first visit. This is not an inexpensive meal, but the service and food quality were amazing. We did the 10 course tasting menu and each was great. If you enjoy wine make sure to get the wine parings. We will be back again."

Melisse,20,What a disappointment.,"I Went there for Father's Day weekend with my girlfriend, The ambience is below average, dark room with no windows and purple wall , I will have to admit the presentation of the food is beautiful as you can see in the pictures but with all honesty and respect to the chef, the taste is not as good as the picture ,the fish was fishy and my steak was medium rare when I asked for medium well, and the rude waitress had the nerve to tell me this is the French way off medium well.  This was my first and last time to Melissa , I believe 500$ for Two people for this kind of foods is a little too much.  3% of the bill for the employee health coverage , what a BS.  I would definitely not recommend this place."

Melisse,50,Perfection...,"Our second time to dine here. Every dish is unique, exquisite and to die for. We chose the seven course menu. The staff were knowledgeable, helpful when asked the ultimate dining experience. Expensive? Yes, if you go by the numbers. No, if you ho by the quality."

Melisse,40,Good not great,"Mélisse certainly has a great reputation - classically French with two Michelin stars back in the day Michelin did LA (2008, 2009) - but it just didn't quite hit the mark.    The menu is a little confusing. We went for the four course with each of these containing multiple choices, some with supplements (for caviar or wagyu for example) and then verbalised specials and offers to split one of the options as an extra course. The end result was a lot of upselling and spending a lot more than the $120/head price for the ""four"" course option. Now I'm not complaining - our first night in the US and definitely there for the experience - but someone more cynical than I might assume the menu structure and the maitre d's selling technique was aimed at creating confusion!    The food was very good but not excellent. White asparagus with morels, lobster bolognese and grand marnier soufflé were standouts.    Service was competent but note comments above. They also missed our cocktail order which was delivered half way through our first course - it seems the aperitif is less of a thing in the US.    We had an enjoyable evening but wouldn't necessarily return. Much preferred Maude on our next night in LA."

Melisse,50,Unique pieces of art..,"If you love and appreciate well educated and experienced chefs then this place should be on your list. All Menus are 5/7/ or 10 courses.  Highly recommend the wine parings..the sommelier hit it right on with each course. Beautiful presentation, high quality ingredients and blends of flavors very unique."

Melisse,50,Fantastic!,"This is a must do if you are in the area. It is one of my top 10 dining experiences...and I've had many all over the world. The service is great, attentive without being intrusive. I told one of the waitstaff who were taking care of me that I enjoyed the house made chocolates so he brought me a few more pieces and surprised me with some to go as I walked out. I had the 4-course tasting menu and was quite satisfied at the end of the night. I loved everything but my favorite dish was theTruffle Tagliatelle..definitely worth the $65.00 supplement and the Scallops. The basil bread os a must try. The restaurant definitely deserves the 2 Michelin Stars!"

Melisse,50,When you need perfection,No chef hello- no crazy scene - no ridiculous bar mixologist - no bs  So why visit -  Excellent staff who cares about your experience  Excellent food presented in a way you remember the flavor not just how it looks on the plate  Wine service is world class  Yes guy savoy comes to greet but his food is mass produced and boring at best  Ducasse corporate  Young up and comers in LA - go for a fun night but expect mistakes  Make a party to remember go to Melisse  Pea soup 9/10 a bit cold  Egg caviar 9/10 flavor is correct but somehow the dish doesn't blend perfectly  Lobster bolognese 9/10 portion to big  Duck 10/10 period !  Breads 8/10 good but not memorable  Cheese cart 5/10 I suggest they drop it. No love here as cheeses are same as murrays at Ralph's - pass  Soufflé 10/10 big hit at the table. Don't miss  I will visit Melisse on a regular basis because I respect the effort to deliver excellent flavors and a friendly professional staff

Melisse,50,An Experience to remember,"An Experience to Remember. The food was not only Delicious but so Beautiful! There were some courses that were bold and some that were light. The many different flavors, smells and the beauty of how it was all put together made for an Dining Experience that will never be forgotten. Staff was incredible and the Chef even came out to talk with us. Melisse is a dream of flavor and art that I am so glad I got to enjoy!"

Melisse,50,Food as art,"Clearly the best restaurant in all of Los Angeles. Every experience is unrivaled. A variety of prix fixe menus with additional special menus such as for Valentine's Day. From the amuse bouche to the appetizers to the entrees, each dish is a surprise with unique combinations and presentations. Service is magnificent without being ostentatious although prices are commensurate with the experience received. I have never left unhappy or disappointed. The ultimate special occasion restaurant in metropolitan LA."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Best Peking duck!,We had a great food experience. Dim sum kombo and chicken soup before the Peking duck. Everything super-tasty and the service was friendly. Recommended!

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Great food and services!,"Frequented Min Jiang Dempsey before eventually hosting my wedding banquet there. The quality of food and services is top-notch, with all dishes carefully designed and prepared. Service staff and restaurant managers were attentive to the needs and wants of customers. Will highly recommend to all chinese food lovers!"

Min Jiang at Dempsey,40,Modern up scale Szechuan cuisine!,"Modern minimalist decoration with wood blinds covering the huge glass windows! Menu looks very refined cuisine. Ordered their set lunch consisting of their special appetisers, soup, abalone with egg white and truffles, steam perch fish, lobster noodles, Beijing duck, pan fried prawns and scallops and lemon grass desert. Taste was good with lovely platings. Service was acceptable while price was on the upper plane! Overall, food tasty a four star!"

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Min Jiang Dempsey,"Went to Min Jiang at Dempsey, we were thrilled with the service by Joshua, Shing Yuet and Steven. They did their best to accommodate our requests and were very friendly, as well as helpful in our menu choices. The food and atmosphere here was good and I enjoyed having dinner here with my family."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,BEST Peking duck in Singapore,The BEST Peking duck ever! Min Jiang was our favourite restaurant when we lived in Singapore. Back on a business trip and Min Jiang was our first meal after we arrived. Wonderful welcome from Joshua who remembered us well from 5 years ago and the food was exceptional. Superb food and service. Highly recommend the Dry Chilli prawns and Beef in black bean sauce if you have room after the Duck ! Thank you Joshua for a fantastic evening.. you made us so welcome. Hope to be back soon !

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Lunch at Min Jiang,Lunch at Min Jiang on 26 May 23 Amazing food and presentation accompanied with impeccable service by our server Boon Xuan

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Good dinner in nice environment,"I went to Ming Jian @ Dempsey for dinner with my bosses from Europe. The atmosphere of the place is fresh but cosy, surprisingly quiet even fully booked. We had pre-ordered the food, which came to the table in good timing. All dishes were perfectly prepared and served professionally by SuiXiao, in addition Boon Xuan made sure that all our extra wishes were fulfilled with a happy smile which brought us all into a good mood. I was a bit concerned upfront as I read some negative reviews but they now have a new fan. We had a perfect evening there."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Lunch at Min Jiang (Dempsey),"Had attended a family lunch at Min Jiang (Dempsey) on 14 April 2023. Our service staff, Joshua, was pleasant, friendly, attentive and prompt. He is knowledgeable about the food and menu, gave us good suggestions. We had a nice pleasant experience at the restaurant and will be back again."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,10,Total disastrous experience and bad services - Food and services are grossly over rated,"DISASTROUS PLACE FOR DINNER..... THINK TWICE    Booked the restaurant months in advance.  Family of 6 of us arrived the restaurant at 6.25pm, place our order (think was 9 dishes) at around 6.45pm. We were served 2 dishes at around 7.10pm. At 7.30pm, we chased for our order, we reminded the waiter for the rest of our order and waited till 8.30pm, nothing was served.    In between, the waiter replaced our choksticks and plates but placed only 5 sets. We asked for 1 more set as there were 6 of us. Waiter came back and literally throw the chopstick on the table.    We asked for 4 glasses of cold tap water and 2 warm water. While waiting for our dishes, we had it top up twice after drinking. On the 3rd top up around 8pm (after waiting for our food for more than an hour), waiter told us that they cannot serve us cold tap water anymore and we need to purchased bottled water which we then ordered sparkling bottle. After 2 refills and they decided that we need to purchase water bottle?. If they have make it clear when when we were ordering food that we need to order the bottle water and they do not serve cold tap water. But not after 2 refill and 1.5 hours after.    Ruined my birthday and family dinner."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,40,Nice ambience,Perhaps it's because we had a nice quiet corner and the setting was really conducive to have a birthday lunch there. Peking duck was excellent as well as the lobster mee sua. Service is pretty decent.

Min Jiang at Dempsey,10,Disappointed,What is the point of having a contact number to call if nobody pick up or disconnected? +6567755501 or +6567740122? I'm not even calling for reservation. I need to ask to get surprise payment for parent’s birthday that having lunch over there at the moment. What is the use of your phone???

Min Jiang at Dempsey,10,Famous Peking Duck?,I am not if the famous Peking actually look like this ? I had this pcs last week. Should I say HUGE OVER-Rated ? Thanks for ruining my expectation

Min Jiang at Dempsey,20,Bad taste in the mouth,"Visited with high hopes, but there was a strand of hair in their artisanal flower tea. The waitress attending to our table came and actually voiced that it was strange that the strand of hair was not in the cup of tea earlier. I tugged on the hair and it was bundled together with the artisanal flower, thankfully or not it proved that the hair was bundled with the tea and not a stray hair from myself ?! Then she hurriedly took the tea away and brought a fresh cup. No other remedial action was taken.    Not going to bother to criticize the other disappointing aspects of this supposed Michelin star restaurant.    The 2 stars remaining are mainly for the nice touch of the birthday greeting given by the waitress with the longevity tiny buns at the end of the meal . Still Min Jiang has fallen far from its heyday standard."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,30,Disappointed duck and service,"Heard from friend that this restaurant is very good especially the duck. Tried to ordered a few dishes, the speed of service was very slow, the duck was so smelly, fish was ok, others were not really tasty. Won’t visit again."

Min Jiang at Dempsey,40,"Great food, service could be better!",The meal and the jasmine tea was excellent! Special mention of the fresh scallops with asparagus & hon shimeji mushrooms and stir fry three treasure vegetables. Dim Sum platter was unavailable and that was a disappointment. The dessert of chilled cream of mango with sago pearls and pomelo was great too. Service was a bit confused and lacking. Overall worth another visit!

Min Jiang at Dempsey,50,Very nice lunch.,Nice location and great space. Nice visibility and view outside with a great bay window. Very good dumplings. Guests very much liked the crispy suck. I loved the crystal prawns.

Min Jiang at Dempsey,40,Ambience is great!,"Brought my mom for a birthday dinner here as we had dinner here previously pre-Covid as a family. Food is great as we remembered, even if the pricing is quite exorbitant. The ambience is just fantastic, and I think they had updated their decor slightly. (Although getting to the place and parking is a bit of a challenge on weekends.) Service overall was a bit slow but our server Raymond did his best and made some good food recommendations. Hope to come back again once we can all dine out as a full family again!"

Min Jiang at Dempsey,30,Just go once for the ‘experience’,"Beautiful settings but crowd was very pretentious. Dishes were hit and miss, especially for the ala carte which are priced significantly higher than dim sum. I guess you’re paying for the decor and design of the restaurant. The ha gao, soup and fish dish were barely passable. Good to go once for the experience but wouldn’t go back regularly for my Chinese fix."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,An Enchanting Sunday Afternoon at Sir Elly's Terrace: A Journey Through Shanghai's Heart,"Picture this: the sun hanging low in the sky, casting a warm golden glow over the bustling Bund of Shanghai. It was a Sunday afternoon, and the city was alive with the harmonious blend of old-world charm and modern energy. Amidst this vibrant tapestry, I found myself on a journey to Sir Elly's Terrace, a hidden gem perched atop the Peninsula Hotel.    The Bund, a historic waterfront area, has long been a canvas that tells the story of Shanghai's evolution. Its skyline, adorned with a collection of colonial-era architecture and towering skyscrapers, mirrors the city's dynamic soul. And in the heart of this lively mosaic, the Peninsula Hotel stands as a testament to the city's elegance and luxury. The Peninsula's history, entwined with the Kadoorie family's legacy, adds an extra layer of significance to this remarkable place.    As I stepped onto Sir Elly's Terrace, a sense of enchantment enveloped me. It was around 5pm, and the terrace was bathed in a soft, ethereal light. The atmosphere was a symphony of relaxation and sophistication – a perfect escape from the city's hustle and bustle. The Terrace's real magic lay in its panoramic views of the Bund. From this vantage point, I could feel time slowing down, allowing me to soak in the city's rich history and its modern ambitions.    In the company of friends, I decided to embrace the moment with a classic cocktail – a Negroni. The Negroni's harmonious blend of flavors seemed to mirror the essence of the Bund itself – a fusion of old and new, bitter and sweet. Sipping the Negroni, I felt connected to the stories that had unfolded on these historic streets.    The Peninsula Hotel is renowned for its impeccable service, and Sir Elly's Terrace was no exception. The staff's genuine warmth and attentiveness elevated the experience from wonderful to unforgettable. Every detail, from the perfect spot to offering insights about the city, was thoughtfully taken care of. It was as though the Peninsula's commitment to excellence extended beyond the walls of the hotel and onto the terrace.    As the sun began its descent, I realized that my visit to Sir Elly's Terrace was more than a mere outing – it was a journey through Shanghai's heart. The Bund's timeless allure, the Kadoorie family's enduring legacy, and the Peninsula's dedication to creating moments of wonder all intertwined to craft an experience that I would forever cherish.    As I reluctantly left the terrace, I couldn't help but marvel at how the city's vibrant energy continued to pulse. The Bund, with its history etched in its stones, stood as a testament to Shanghai's journey through time. And in the midst of it all, Sir Elly's Terrace remained a hidden oasis, a radiant jewel that had offered me an experience of pure enchantment. As I walked away, I knew that this was more than a visit – it was a story I would tell for years to come, a memory that had become a part of my own journey."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Nice drinks and wonderful view.,"Breathtaking views over Shanghai and incredible cocktails. The service is on the slow side (read 20 minutes for a ginger ale), but everyone was friendly. Definitely recommend."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Hits and misses,They didn’t get my reservation right so we didn’t get the river view. Not a good start    We ordered a la carte:  - oysters very good  - crab and caviar good  - beef tartare too sour  - sole good  - beef and foie gras excellent    They didn’t have camomile tea. They offered ginger and later retracted. Hmm    And no petit fours. Hmm

Sir Elly's Restaurant,30,High expectations with some disappointments,"Very nice place with a great view that offers a beautiful ambiance. BUT was not blown away as I was hoping to for a Michelin restaurant, for 2 reasons.    My wife and I ordered 6-course Chef's degustation menu for a full experience. As soon as we sat down, we were offered a glass of champagne to start, BUT in a manner that was presented, it seemed complimentary with dinner. Our mistake in presuming so. Why big deal - the glass of this champagne was almost 30% of the full dining experience. Considering we also ordered a bottle of wine with our dinner, 500RMB per glass champaign should not have been presented in a manner that insinuates a complimentary drink and without any indication of cost. Also, why my bottle was opened, my wife's champaign was not and the wine was clearly flat. It turns out we may have not been the only ones who were caught by surprise as diners next to our next table were also visibly surprised when the check arrived.    Secondly, one of the 6 dishes was a steak which we asked for medium, but, in our opinion, it was certainly more than rare on the inside. Still not bad, but again, expectations were different.    As for the dishes, foie gras was delicious, seafood dishes interesting, but not my favorites, and the chocolate dessert was nothing special - rich chocolate that looks nice but tastes like a nice dessert you may get in any good restaurant.    Is it worth it? Besides a nice ambiance, for a Michelin restaurant, I was certainly expecting more, and certainly did not like feeling blindsided with a champaign."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Best View In Shanghai!,"Best View In Shanghai by far out of any of the roof top bars in the city. Excellent service and they really know how to mix a good drink. The corner table has the best view but to book it you must order bottle service. If you want something a little more quiet, head down to the 13th floor and sit at the bar. Great view of the Bund"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Amazing view and original cocktails!,I visited this place for a few cocktails and for the view - I must confess both were amazing! A must visit.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Great view of the Bund illuminations,We ended up here for cocktails and nibbles just after dark on our recent trip. The view of the from the terrace bar is spectacular.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,service isn't up to par but everything else is,"this place has the best view and vibe (chill, upscale) vibe in Shanghai, Told the waitress that we did not like our ""daqueries"" and she kinda shrugged like what do you want me to do about it...that wasn't the best reaction still would be back"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,The best of the best,"We had dinner at Sir Elly's on the last night of our recent trip to Shanghai. We stayed for one week at The Peninsula and worked our way through all of their excellent restaurants. Dinner at Sir Elly's was a wonderful experience. An amazing evening that started with cocktails on the roof top and then a beautifully crafted dinner with superb, warm but never intrusive service. It just doesn't get any better. Highly recommended."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,The view is worth the price,The most romantic view in Shanghai! Absolutely breathe taking. It’s crowded during sunset - so come early. The tables are worth every cent and the food and champagne is very good - the weather was beautiful and we spent the entire evening here.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Fine Dining Lunch,"Wow ! Very good food and service, plus a very awesome view. Comes at a price but worth it. Recommend the fixed lunch menu. Certainly the best option to keep the price down a little. A lot of little dishes that you don’t see get added . All very good !"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Wow wow wow,"We’d been to the Flair roof top bar the evening before and thought nothing could beat it. But how wrong I was, the views from this bar are spectacular. When we arrived they were having a Mad Hatters Tea Party and you had to buy a ticket which included a drink or buy a package which then entitled you to a table. Whilst it wasn’t cheap we would have got a package if we could have chosen something else so we just got the ticket to go up. I wasn’t keen on the free cocktail so quickly ordered a Negroni which I paid for, this was very well made. We also had burgers, fish and chips and a bottle of wine. As we’d ordered quite a bit I asked if I could sit down just for a few minutes, next thing I know we are being led into the VIP area where we spent the rest of our evening. Whilst it is very pricey £70 for a bottle of wine the view and the ambience made it completely worth every penny. What an amazing way to spend our last night in Shanghai and China - Thank you"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Wonderful view! Amazing rooftop,"Wow! Unforgettable view of The Bund and Pudong, with the colorful buildings. Facing the Pearl Tower, it is a rooftop with reasonable priced drinks and expensive snacks, but honestly, it worths! High class service! Did not try the restaurant (below floor) but will some day."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,14th floor!,Not too high!!! But the views are absolutely priceless. Great drinks and snacks. The hotel is absolutely first class and the rooftop did not dissapointed us! Is our top second view in Shanghai! Eorth coming here for sunset too!

Sir Elly's Restaurant,30,"Great views, but ....","Went for evening drinks here because it has such great views of Lujiazui and the Bund. Of course, it did not disappoint in this regard.  We found one section closed for maintenance (I’m told) and then two other areas closed off for people with a package deal I get it), but there was no- one there and they would not allow us in to take photographs? The real issue here is that 3/4 times I received a straight and curt answer, but no flexibility - this included moving seats to get a better view. It gave me the impression that following the rules was first priority, not the customer. They could have communicated better and more friendly. I was also surprised that some staff members had very limited English. Please not that prices are expensive here - CNY 55 for a can of Coke! We did enjoy the complimentary snacks."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,20,Dinner,"Visually interesting for the presentations, however the taste is not there.  The service is good but prices are too high versus the taste expected in one star Michelin restaurant"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Wonderful rooftop bar overlooking The Bund - well worth a few drinks,A great bar to visit for some five star views of Shanghai and The Bund. Pricey drinks that pay for the views you can enjoy from what must be one of the best rooftop bars in Shanghai. A cigar friendly bar that even on a cold night has a warm feeling about it - not sure where the heat comes from! Great Peninsular service from the bar staff. I’ll definitely visit again.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Excellent restaurant,"I went to Sir Elly in mid-May during a business trip. It was my first time there.    I went to the restaurant twice but with different friends. I went there once on a weekday and the other time on a Saturday.    Their business lunch on weekday was wonderful at a reasonable price. The view of the restaurant was also great.    I went back on the weekend and found that their brunch was also wonderful. I like the egg with lobster, which was out of my expectation.    The best was their service. We ordered the brunch with free flow of champagne. We found that the price on my menu was different from the price on my friends' menu (mine was wrongly printed), The manager was so good that they allowed us to use the lower price.    The different on the price was not big but it did give us a very good customer experience.    We will definitely come back to such a good restaurant."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Postcard view of Pudong !,Everyone can easily get a postcard photo of the Bund and Pudong without filters! Recommended to have a drink before dinner while watching the change of the skyline during the evening :)

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,"Great Food, Impeccable Service, Wonderful View","During a port call while cruising on the Queen Mary 2, my wife and I had Saturday Brunch at Sir Elly's in the Peninsula Hotel Shanghai. The food was excellent and the presentation so exquisite that we took pictures of every course. The service, led by Dorlco Ip, the restaurant manager, was impeccable. Ms. Ip's friendliness and helpfulness was reflected by her staff. With its location on the fourteen floor of the Peninsula Hotel, it has sweeping views over the Bund and Pudong. We would definitely go back."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Great Meal,We had a great meal at this Michelin starred restaurant. Food was creative and the presentation was exquisite.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Fine Dining in Great Atmosphere,"A friend proposed to come here for a dinner, really a sterling, sedate atmosphere for a fine evening.  The service was on high level as well, and the food was just outstanding. There are only few places in Shanghai I could tell which come close to that level. (easier to find ind Hongkong than in Mainland China...)  A place I immediately put on top of my shortlist of top dining places in Shanghai."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,one from fav,one of the best cuisine in town.  can enjoy a good experience or by yourself or with your beloved or with an important client.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,fabulous views of the Bund,A wonderful place to sit and have a drink while taking in the views of the Bund and Pudong. At night all the buildings are lit up and you have a light show. Absolutely fantastic!

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,"Excellent, great cuisine.","Went there a couple of times always great food and service, Chef Terence do it great. On top of best and probably the best in China."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Best view on the Bund,"Located on the 14th floor, this rooftop bar has the best view over the Pudong skyscrapers as well as the Bund. The ambiance is pretty chic. The drinks are pretty pricy though but you kinda expect it if you come to Peninsula’s rooftop bar. Drinks come with 3 plays of nuts and okra chips. The staff are very friendly and professional and speak multiple languages. I’ll come back again in a few weeks when I’m back in Shanghai again!"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Best View at the West Bund,"Whenever I go to Shanghai, this is always my first stop after dropping my luggage.    I went there around 8:30 pm without reservation. The Terrace at the 14th flloor was packed with guests (advance reservation is a must for the stunning view). I told staff at the entrance that I would go to the bar without knowing that the bar area has been turned into a standing zone. As two bar tenders were busily preparing drinks, no one had time to ask what I needed so I just went down to the indoor bar at the restaurant at the 13th floor.    Since the upper floor was packed, there was only one bar tender at the bar of 13th floor. He seemed new but helpful. Then I realised I couldn't sit right behind the bar near the window overlooking Pudong again.    Although Peninsula's Deutz Blanc de Blancs 2010 is still good as I love champagne, to be honest, I was very disappointed that I couldn't sit at the bar area overlooking Pudong at both 13th and 14th floor anymore. Once I had sat there for almost hours when it was 3-5 degree celsius to look at the view. I miss that!    Somehow I understand this for the sake of all guests who would love to look at the stunning view."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Delightful lunch,"It is nice to have some western food once in a while, when visiting Shanghai. That is what I craved one day around lunch time. This place is located in Peninsula Hotel in Bund. The lunch is enjoyable, with good views. The service is impeccable."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,View to die for,"We went for the view and stayed for the drinks and food. Sliders and truffle fries were better than anything in the US and the view was spectacular. Snacks with the drinks were very good, too, but did I mention the view?"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Why not the Best,"The fog turned into a tempest on the Bund with heavy rain and lightning, a bit scary also for the experienced traveler. The Peninsula provides shelter and a cool white wine (the Peninsula house wine) for aperitif on the ground floor near the lobby where all the luxurious stores wait for rich customers. A decent Combo with a female singer and a good saxophone plays old standards. Very nice.  Then up to the 13th floor where Sir Elly's welcomes you. A beautifully decorated old fashioned room with a high ceiling and a splendid view over the Bund, the Hungpiao river and the Pudong bank. Wonderful giant flower pots, breath taking.  Then a friendly waiter, a short menu full of delicacies. I picked the scallops to start and a beef filet for the main course. Both beautifully presented and well cooked by experts, fully to my taste.  A dark red Rioja to go along. A young talented pianist who needed a hint to abondon repeating himself over and over. Fine background music.  All together a good evening and meanwhile the rain has stopped."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,30,"Food was average, Decor and view amazing, there are better places on the Bund.","The decor was beautiful. However the food whilst good, didn't really have the x factor. We each chose 5 course alacarte (1080rmb = $216 AU) which was 1 hot & 1 cold entree, 1 seafood dish and 1 main then a dessert. They had a 2 Michelin star chef recommendation menu but we opted for the alacarte for a mixture.    We had a mix between caviar tuna tartare, king crab ceviche, scallop with squid ink crisp, fregola, black cod, lamb and pork. The bread inbetween was very good - special mention was the black truffle croissant type bun.    Good intimate experience but comparing to other one-Michelin starred there is a lot left to be desired.    The dishes weren't memorable and I dare say that if it wasn't for the 3 types of bread we would have been hungry still."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,"Perfect for a quiet classy lunch, served with stunning views","What makes Sir Elly stand out is not the quality of the food (good but not great) for it’s One Michelin Star but it is the entire package of location in the classy Peninsula, great views of the Bund, luxurious ambience, attentive service that sums up the total elegance of the experience. A quiet lunch for a very reasonable value, without pretentious long waitlist like some of the other Michelin starred establishments and genuine not haughty service is the highlight. Food is good but there is always better elsewhere but for everything else Sir Elly offers I will not hesitate to go back."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Excellent food and service,Excellent food and service If open the view from terrace is really great Expensive choice though around 200 euro for a ful course and wine

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Great views,Came here for a couple of drinks before heading out for the evening. The bartender on duty that evening really knew how to make a drink. The views of the bund are excellent.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,classy,"had brunch there during cny, it was pure pleasure. food, service, and views were all great. cloak is rare but there’s one. asked for sparkling water and mistakenly given still, apologies and replaced immediately. a shift change of staff, our waiter came and let us know she’s leaving. life is good at the pen."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,"Very good food, wine pairing and view","Had a great dinner with a fabulous view at the window. Slight turn off at beginning. Was pushed to go for a champagne aperitif and to place my orders within 10min.  It became clear that “people” wanted to get the s start get home, good evidence is that the sommelier went home before 22:00    Now to the really good things.    Each of the 3 course means was prepared and pr dented perfectly. Warm plates, served right, fine food and tasty. Right portions and timing intervals between dishes. One of the higher up waiters did an excellent job proposing wines that paired really well with the food. To be able to have competent guidance and presentation by people who care about their grooming, way of talking and commitment to excellence made the meal even more enjoyable.    Very good, will come back regularly!    Also, other guests can ruin even the best venues, I had the feeling that the other customers were “better” than the loud talking, mobile phone obsessed WeChat crowd you can’t get away from in even some of the better places. This is a perk!"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Always lovely in the Pen,Always above standard and view from hotel is lovely. Peninsula will never disappoint anyone. Good food and great service. Home away from home.

Sir Elly's Restaurant,50,Very The Peninsula Hotel,"We have a dinner on the 30th. Food was good with The Peninsula service. Nice place, nice service with a great location."

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Beautifully presented small plates,I have two perfectly cooked scallops for my main course - a very small main course! They were lovely and served with citrus but I would have favoured slightly more. My friend had a tiny piece of fish. Dessert was bigger!

Sir Elly's Restaurant,40,Very Good,"Beautiful view, is amazing, the food is very good and the drink too, the Hotel is so beautiful, and is very nice to take photo in the night"

Sir Elly's Restaurant,20,Good food let down by unfriendly service,"This place has a Michelin Star and the food certainly deserves it, albeit at a very high price (the 8 course tasting menu comes in at just under RMB2000 a person before tax and service). If you are looking for a good French Michelin meal the food will not disappoint. But oh dear, the service. From the moment we walked in we were somehow made to feel unwelcome. Through the whole two hours we barely received a smile from the waiter. I asked for the 8 course tasting menu minus a couple of courses I didn’t fancy. Initially I was take it was ‘all or nothing’, later ‘OK but we will still charge you for the whole thing’ (even though I hadn’t asked for a discount). Bread was excellent but served sparingly - again making one feel that I was impertinent to ask for another slice. Drinks were topped up when the waiter could be bothered rather than when necessary (and the dining room was far from busy). I would not have minded but it’s the kind of place that insists on placing your unfinished water/wine bottle on a separate table some way from your table.  I would not go back and to be honest there are better, cheaper and friendlier French meals to be had in this town (try L’Atelier). The kitchen deserves its Michelin Star but the front of house does not."

Odette,50,Beyond amazing,"We had the most fabulous evening at this fine establishment. The food was delicious , the presentation was dramatic, and the service was divine.    We’ve been to many three star Michelin restaurants and Odette is in a class by itself.    Elegant but not stuffy. The staff was knowledgeable about the wine ( and the list is extensive).    The add ons to the set menu are offered in an irresistible way, be careful, they do add up.    Special shout out to Vanessa who went above and beyond!"

Odette,50,Odette,"We had an amazing dinner at Odette on September 28th. The food and service were top notch. The wine pairings come from lesser known regions and complement the food well. The food - well, the food surpassed our lofty expectations, simply delicious. Highlights were the Mozambique langoustine, chef’s signature pigeon preparation, and the mind-blowing “Blanc” dessert.    The ultimate highlight of the night however was taking with Chef Julien after the meal. It helped that dinner service was over and he could relax but it really was special, many thanks chef. We enjoyed our jam in Bali! Also, special commendation to Sarah! She was awesome! A future star no doubt in the restaurant and hospitality industry, you can see the determination to do her very best. Thanks to all!"

Odette,50,Place is wonderful,"Dining at Odette in Singapore was a gastronomic journey that touched the soul. The restaurant’s dedication to culinary artistry was evident in every dish. The tasting menu was a symphony of flavors and textures, each plate presented as a masterpiece. The staff’s impeccable service and knowledge of the menu elevated the dining experience. The restaurant’s elegant and contemporary setting, with views of the National Gallery Singapore, created a memorable atmosphere. Odette is not just a restaurant; it’s a celebration of fine dining, a testament to Chef Julien Royer’s talent, and a must-visit for anyone seeking an extraordinary culinary experience in Singapore."

Odette,50,Made my night!,"The well deserved three stars! Even though it’s a three-stars restaurant, you don’t have that solemn atmosphere yet everyone in the team was very friendly and welcoming. You feel as if you were dining at their home right when you first entered the door. Service was impeccable and all staff knows the dishes really well and understands dishes behind too. A really enjoyable experience."

Odette,30,"Odette us a good restaurant, but not Michelin nor the best in Asia","Odette is the first Singapore-based 3 stars Michelin restaurant that I have patronised. I've had my fair share of Michelin restaurants around the world, in my opinion, some exceeded my expectations, some are worthy of the title and there are quite a few just like Odette, fell short.    I had been intrigued by Odette for about five years now, as we frequently passed by it at the national gallery. Despite hearing both positive and negative reviews from peers, I knew that the only way to judge was through firsthand experience. Given its high price, I decided to reserve it for a special occasion, my partner's birthday celebration.The night ended with me being $1600 lighter, with a full stomach but an empty spirit.    The national gallery provided an impeccable backdrop for a restaurant, surrounded by artistic ambiance. Nonetheless, the interior of Odette felt lacklustre, stuffy, and dim during the dinner service. The chairs lacked comfort, especially for someone tall like me.    The menu offered a vegetarian choice and a classic option, and we opted for the latter. While the staff was polite, they seemed distant and impersonal, which was surprising for a 3-star Michelin restaurant, touted as ""the best restaurant in Asia.""    The first lacklustre incident occurred when we were ordering our wine, we inquired about the profile of the selected Volnay wine. The staff's response was that he had not yet tried it. While I appreciate his honesty, it seemed surprising that in a 3-star Michelin restaurant, the staff was not familiar with the wines listed on the menu. Moreover, he made no effort to seek assistance from someone who might be knowledgeable about the wine.    In general, the dishes presented at Odette were visually appealing and skillfully executed with precision. However, they fell short of delivering the ""wow"" factor and innovation that I typically associate with top-tier Michelin dining. Certain dishes felt safe and predictable, leaving me craving bolder flavours and more imaginative combinations. As a complete dining experience, the dishes failed to harmoniously convey the essence of Odette's unique narrative, leaving me with the impression that the restaurant lacked soul.    However, the real disappointment came when we reached the dessert course. Considering it was a special occasion and the esteemed reputation of the restaurant, we had anticipated a customised dessert from the chef. To our disappointment, all they did was place a candle and write ""happy birthday"" on my partner's plate when serving the dessert. The experience turned even more disheartening when we noticed the table next to us being served a bespoke chocolate cake for their birthday celebration. The staff made no effort to address the situation, and the proximity of the tables made it all the more disconcerting. This left us with a bitter aftertaste.    As the evening drew to a close, they prepared a takeaway gift for us. However, it felt rather awkward as they only provided one jam for the two of us to share, essentially giving one gift for both diners.    To wrap it all up, in my opinion If you seek an elegant dining experience with refined dishes and good service, Odette certainly meets those criteria. Just not 3-star Michelin level nor the best restaurant in Asia."

Odette,20,Odette: A Missed Symphony of Flavors and Service,"Date of visit: 24 July 2023 (Dinner)  My partner and I had high hopes when my partner made a reservation at Odette for my birthday occasion. Unfortunately, our dining experience fell short of expectations, leaving us feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.    We found the dishes to be mediocre and lacking the soul and passion that one would expect from a fine dining establishment. Each plate lacked a memorable journey and narrative, failing to evoke emotions or excitement with every bite.    To start, we were served cold, hard sourdough loaves of bread and truffle brioche. The bread should have been warm and inviting, but instead, it felt like an afterthought. This set the tone for the rest of the meal, where we encountered further disappointments.    The kinki fish dish, in particular, was served with bones still present, making it unpleasant to eat. Such an oversight is unacceptable for a restaurant of Odette's calibre.    Moving on to the desserts, they were equally forgettable. The caneles in the petit four were a letdown, as they were inconsistent with my partner's; mine were hard to chew and far from the pillowy texture, they should have had. In contrast, their cheese platter was the highlight of our meal and we enjoyed that the most.    Adding to the disappointment was the lacklustre acknowledgement of my birthday. While my partner had indicated the special occasion during the reservation, all we received was a ""happy birthday"" message written on the dessert dish that was already a part of the regular menu. It felt impersonal and insincere, and this sentiment was amplified when we noticed another couple beside us, celebrating a birthday being presented with a birthday cake by the restaurant. The contrast left us feeling overlooked and unappreciated.    Beyond the food and service, the overall atmosphere lacked warmth and friendliness, failing to create a welcoming ambience that could have elevated the dining experience. Furthermore, what makes matters worse is the lack of any service recovery effort from the restaurant. Despite our disappointment, Odette hasn't reached out to us to address our concerns or offer any form of apology.    In conclusion, our experience at Odette was marred by mediocre and lacklustre food and a general lack of attention to detail. For a restaurant with such a prestigious reputation (the best restaurant in Asia and holds 3 Michelin stars), we expected much more. We hope that Odette takes this feedback constructively and works to improve its offerings and service in the future. Until then, we cannot recommend Odette as a dining destination for anyone seeking a truly exceptional experience and a celebratory occasion."

Odette,10,Roadkill Dinner,"I’ve had 1-star experiences in Singapore with Nouri, Bacchanalia and Putien. I’ve had the greatest expectations heading into 3-star Odette, given the many positive reviews and accolades.    The staff didn’t talk much about the dishes or the inspiration behind them. They had close to 10 sommeliers and the guy that served me just said this page and the next page have Sauvignon Blancs.    The only takeaway was pigeon being served as the main course. I’ve had game meat in New Zealand and I can tell you pigeon is more obnoxious. Imagine the smallest morsel of meat you can cut with a knife and fork and infuse it with aged yolks of three century eggs. I only had a small bite and had to stop myself from retching seven times after with the sheer traumatic remembrance of the taste.    They only had two menu options - vegetarian and meat. Imagine shelling out $2,000 for 1.5 bottles of the cheapest white wine and the meat course for 3 people and being severely underwhelmed."

Odette,50,Business lunch or a couples lunch,"Magical restaurant in the national Museum of Singapore. Everywhere is white and full of lights, which is restricted on the plates: And lunch would be a better idea because the light coming from offsite creates a different Ambiance."

Odette,50,Fantastic French food,Pricey but worth it at the same time. Just brilliant food and presented so amazingly well. Hoghly recommend this restaurant!

Odette,50,Exceptional. Again.,"Having dined at Odette previously, I looked forward to a return visit on my recent trip to Singapore. It did not disappoint.    From booking to departure, the service is flawless - staff are friendly and attentive (but not overbearing). The food is excellent, with allergy and dietary requirements expertly catered for. The matching wine a perfect pairing. And the venue, a historical building with a modern open plan layout and open kitchen.    Opting for the vegetarian tasting menu:  - Amuse bouche (delicious, incl. their signature cheese shoe pastry scroll)  - Mushroom and truffle soup  - Avocado many ways, with an excellent use of textures  - Beetroot, again with a superb mix of textures and flavours, including a sorbet beetroot  - Organic egg (presented by the chef personally, with second to none)  - Artichoke, which again had a good mix of textures  - Mizo and Yuzo saki  - Pumpkin pasta with truffle… again great flavours, perfectly cooked pasta  - Palate cleanser a rose-based sorbet  - Desert delicious  - Petit four nice mix of refreshing and sweet    A minor criticism, given my visit coincided with Perignon truffle season in France it was disappointing there was not an option to pay a supplement to add it to multiple courses (as they had with the main)."

Odette,50,Outstanding,"Another glorious dinner at Odette, about my 5th. Nestled in the National Gallery, this 3 michelin star restaurant and voted best restaurant in Asia 2023 is a treat    About 8 courses of very good to excellent items. Chef’s signatures are always there - organic egg and pigeon. The other dishes were wow - langustine ravioli and kinki fish    Service excellent too    You leave with homemade jam and desire to return"

Odette,50,"Outstanding food, amazing people","The most comprehensive range of flavors and textures. My 4th time, and not my last, if my pocket can take it. Good ingredients and great staff don't come cheap, but it's value that I appreciate. All the dishes were outstanding, with new innovations. What I notice at Odette is how Julien Royer loves and trusts his staff, or as he refers to them, colleagues. That's evident in the fantastic food, calming ambience and classy, not stuffy, experience. A treasure to have in Singapore"

Odette,50,an amazing wine pairing!,"My husband and I went to Odette when we visited Singapore, and overall it was a great experience and certainly at the level of a Michelin 3* restaurant, even before the pandemic.    Around the world, service standards have suffered, especially at the higher and restaurants. That was not evident here because all the staff were very attentive and knowledgeable and present. A special remark goes to the staff who seamlessly interacted with us on different courses while still being aware of what we had eaten previously.    My husband and I split the two menus, so I got the vegetarian and he got the meat option. This way we could see everything that they offered. And also, the wine pairing was completely different, which was a bonus.    I won’t go into all of the dishes because there’s too many, and they are liable to change, but the highlights were the uni and caviar, the charred avocado, and the gorgeous smoked egg.    Odette probably had the best wine pairing that I’ve ever had at a restaurant. Some wines were unattainable because they had great relationships with Italian wineries. Some wines were very expensive on both menus, and I say that because oftentimes it’s just cheap white wines from the previous year on these venues, but that was not the case here. They even had some very high-level California reds that we had not had before. There was a lot of variety of wines between the vegetarian and meat menus. Wine service was seamless and the multiple wine servers were very knowledgeable about the offerings and why the pairings worked.    Overall, a great meal, and certainly a highlight in Singapore."

Odette,50,Exceptional Experience,"The Best of the Best! Odette, much more than 3 stars!    Haha, plagiarised with permission from my buddy Sunil, but a few add ons!    Julien Royer has the ultimate in talent & skill! Such perfection, such detailing, such skill! Overwhelmed to say the least!    Today's service was impeccable, you think fear of the 6'4 German contributes, but there was undoubted warmth and sincerity in everything done.    The food was spectacular. The best meal here ever for me. And with no pigeon too, (a usual winner at Odette) So that says a lot. The standouts were the lobster and kinki dishes. Precision personified. The little pieces of squid at the side were perfectly elegant. Magic.    I was asked wether the Lobster or Kinki fish was better! Impossible to answer as both were 💯 pointers in our books!    And the chicken rice to end... wonderful audacity. And no chili needed or wanted. My buddy didn’t realise that “Poularde de Bresse en Vessie” is such an iconic dish originated by the chef of the century Paul Bocuse who would have been so proud!    A final shout out to the sauciers. The sauces today were truly amazing. Such balance and punch.    Thanks again.    #odette #odettesingapore #michelin #theworldsbest50 #wgs #worldgourmetsummit  #singapore #foodsg #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #gourmet #cuisine #foodagram #foodaddict #SGfood #sgfoodstagram #sglifestylesingapore    @julienroyer"

Odette,20,Overrated and overpriced.,Went with friends recently. Overrated and overpriced. Food average and wine pairing very poor. I did not get the sense that there was a lot of thoughts into the wines. Milking its fame before the reviewers catch up and take away their stars!

Odette,40,It was an ok experience,"Sorry, not upto 3 stars. Les Amis was better. Cavier quality was not great. The egg dish was too rich. Steamed Kinki fish was not good. Pigeon was ok. Other dishes were good. For three star, everything has to be excellent and perfect, which it was not."

Odette,50,Holy crap! Amazing,"Just phenomenal…one of the best meals I’ve ever had. Enjoyed every course and did the langoustine ravioli supplement which was quite possibly the best dish I’ve ever had. Yes, I know…a lot of “bests” but I have no way else to describe it. Courses were also plentiful and weren’t small bites leaving you yearning for more every time…even though I wanted another helping after each one. Well done Chef Royer!"

Odette,40,"Very good quality but missing the ""secret sauce""","The dining experience at Odette is exceptional - the food was really good, good presentation and strong service standards.    However, I cannot justify the cost given what else is available worldwide at similar (if not lower prices) - consider Quay (Sydney), Gramercy Tavern (New York) or even Jaan (Singapore).    The secret missing ingredient is the ""story"" from the staff - there is only a basic explanation provided in respect of each dish. I had to ask questions on the source of the ingredients etc. In other words, there is no emotional connection / journey built into the experience.    As a simple example, Jaan (Singapore) was better experience and value for money - importantly, the Chef at Jaan comes to the table to present the main dish - an exceptionally nice touch that does not exist at Odette. Jaan also tells the story in respect of some of the dishes at least in terms of linking back to the Chefs heritage / upbringing in the UK - that connection is not sufficiently explored at Odette DURING the meal (NB: there is a lot of information on the website though)"

Odette,50,Highlight dinner in this Singapore trip,"Odette... this has been on my wish list for years even before Covid but I have never been able to book it... Now that I can, I must seize this opportunity...    The menu is simple in terms of choice, either vegetarian or the standard 7 course selection.    I have been to the sister restaurant ""Louise"" in HK a few times and let me just say without visiting Odette, the experience is not complete. While the smoked organic egg was also available in the ""Louise"" menu, the Rosemary smoked organic egg at Odette completely re-defines my interpretation of this dish. The smell, texture and taste of the whole experience brings me to another level. Yes, the one at Louise was good but this was exceptional.    As I already had the pigeon at ""Claudine"" for lunch that day, the staff there was kind enough to replace that course with poularde de bresse which I appreciated.    Other memorable dishes on the menu would be the Marukyo Uni and scottish blue lobster.    Overall, the staff was attentive but I must say that the hefty corkage (without a 1 for 1 policy) is quite overwhelming. I also noticed that not many tables were opening/drinking wines which I thought was very unusual.    Memorable moments do come with a price, and obviously an experience at Odette is of no exception, but nonetheless, it is an experience I am more willing to pay for... and I am glad I had it with 2 of my closest friends here.    One last note, do arrive at the venue earlier as the National Gallery is also a place worth visiting before your gastronomic journey."

Odette,30,Birthday,"We tried the 7 courses, great ambiance chic and simple, 3 courses very amazing but a bit disappointed by the rest for the price. Good to try but we will not come back"

Odette,50,Michelin Star Experience,"Excellent ambience and service. Presentation of each item - visual, audio and taste of course. Try their 7 course Epicure menu. Need to book ahead. Great for lunch or dinner. Great for anniversary."

Odette,50,Expensive but worth it,Had a amazing dinner paired with wine. Food was really impressive which i am really big fan. Service was top notch without any fail. Well done and keep it up guys!

Odette,50,Honeymoon dining ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Thank you Chef Adam Wan, John and team from Odette for the most magical experience. My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon in Singapore and this was the perfect meal.    We dined with Odette for lunch in the main dining hall and went with the “Epicure” tasting menu + wine pairing. I made the reservation nearly 2 months out. Loved the story behind the restaurant. Each “Act” had a beautiful presentation, fresh ingredients with well balanced flavors. I particularly loved the “Mushroom tea,” Rosemary egg and Buttered Scallop.    We 100% hope to be back and dine with you again some time in the future :)"

Odette,50,Outstanding Odette,"1 of 3 restaurants with 3 michelin stars in singapore. From amuse bouche to petit fours, every dish is very good to excellent. The pigeon main is outstanding. My partner doesn’t eat dessert and the fruit platter put up is not as impressive as the best one from Chef’s table, Bangkok    Very good service, though they forgot our tea at the end"

Odette,50,Excellent food - Staff went above and beyond,"Went for a solo lunch - was given a ringside seat so that I could watch the kitchen in lieu of conversation. Each course was flavoursome and cooked to perfection - the morsels of squid accompanying the fish course almost melting in the mouth without a hint of rubberiness. Wine pairings were well matched and just the right side of novel for my palate, a good example being the enjoyable Savagnin's nutty almost sherrylike stylings alongside the chorizo accented smoked egg. Similar innovation was evidenced by the beetroot course - a variety of flavours to be explored, perhaps carefully if wearing a pale outfit! A minor hiccough was dealt with incredibly generously by the excellent team lead by JA. I will return as soon as their busy diary and my travels allow!"

Thevar,40,Thevar,"Food was excellent but i think restaurant is understaffed. air condition directly blows on seats, very uncofortable. Toilets were dirty"

Thevar,50,A masterful elevation of South Indian Flavours,"A delightful non-pretentious meal that demonstrated that south Indian flavours can use showcased in sophisticated, beautifully presented, and tasty dishes."

Thevar,50,Excellent experience,It is definitely a must if you comiyto Singapore. Mano and his team are just amazing so it’s the food! Really some of a place!

Thevar,50,Indian fusion with precise flavours,"Creative menu combining international food-scene and typical Indian flavours. Very precise and authentic flavours with great presentation. Wine-pairing could have been better, but service was just brilliant."

Thevar,50,Delightful Magical,"Deserves all the accolades.. if you wonder what art taste like, then allow the talented Chef Mano Thevar and his amazing team take you on the fantastic course.. sit back and take your time.."

Thevar,30,Not worth the hype,Food was average a lot of misses and some very ok. Understand it's a very labour intensive process to prepare and present the food but I have had better value food at Michelin star restaurants.

Thevar,50,Magnificent meal and experience,This has been by far one of the most amazing meals I have had. Each dish had its own unique touch. The staff explained each dish in detail including how best to enjoy all the flavors of the dish. The restaurant has a small number of tables allowing the staff to be super attentive to the table and patrons. Truly make you feel like a VIP. Kudos to the chef and staff. A well deserved 2 stars!

Thevar,50,One of best meals ever,"To be fair, we went here several years ago for my birthday. I chose it after reading how Chef Thevar combined his food dishes from home with his classic training to create a fusion of cuisine. It was one of the most fun, tastiest dinners I have ever enjoyed. Everyone was amazed at the balance and blends of flavors...I can still (In a good way!) taste the dhosa all these years later. Incredible dinner! Thank you"

Thevar,50,2nd Time Back and It Keeps Getting Better,"The best food experience we have ever had. Chef Thevar brings immense flavour and creativity with some truly homey Asian influences. It’s not pretentious, it’s not a mass affair. It just delivers a great memory."

Thevar,30,Underwhelming dinner in an overwhelmed restaurant,"A long wait between each dish adds to the poor dining experience. Chefs looked unprepared for 5:30pm diners and were extremely flustered while preparing snacks. I had to wait 10mins for snacks to be served. As dinner went on, there were telltale signs of an overwhelmed kitchen. Chefs had trouble ensuring consistency in the dishes served. Hokkaido Scallop with coconut sothi was a standout but the following dish, Boston Lobster Venn Ponggal, was too chewy for my liking. Chettinad Chicken Roti was a creative take on Mexican taco. However Beef Bryani with Wagyu shortrib had its fair share of issues. The beef bryani was outstanding with a mix of pistachio and cranberries giving it a sweet, sour, and savory taste. Unfortunately the Wagyu shortrib fell short of expectation. It is possible the chef may have mishandled the timing or heat leading to a dry and slightly chewy texture.    Non-alcoholic paring was a confusing mess. Sommelier and chefs need better communication in ensuring that drinks go well with the dishes served. Unfortunately the sommelier couldn't explain the thought process behind each pairing and serve them as it is resulting in each drink being at odds with each dish."

Thevar,30,Definitely not worth the price,"I think the menu started really well! Their entry items are truly gorgeous and so were the two desserts presented! Shoutout to that ghee sponge with sweet corn payasam!! Truly a magical dish!    However the raita, rasam and petite four(?) were severely lacking. The raita was too sweet (personal opinion), rasam was trying to be a miso soup (personal opinion) and the peach fizzy shot which is the petite fours was not fizzy and honestly was the most underwhelming item and ended the meal pretty terribly (I’d say this isn’t a personal opinion).    Save your money, you won’t feel like it was worth your money."

Thevar,50,Great food created with passion and humility,Gotta be my top modern indian restaurant in SG. Familiar Indian flavours from Malaya peninsula done a la Fine dining techniques with European influence. & Absolutely delightful hors D’oeuvres + star of night wagyu beef short ribs briyani ..💗 Chef Manor’s laudable and dedicated passion in his fine creations is worth its 2 michelin accolades!

Thevar,50,A culinary adventure!,"We secured a reservation here based on reviews across a variety of different sites, all I can say is we weren’t disappointed! We sat at the counter which is a great spot as we chatted to the chef/owner and got to see the expertise of of him and his team as they worked to produce beautiful dishes. The service was impeccable and the food was an amazing experience for our tastebuds. Highly recommended."

Thevar,50,Excellent gastronomic experience,"All the dishes were excellent from starters to the desserts. Even the palate cleaner was a hit, in fact my best pick. A well deserved 2 stars."

Thevar,50,A culinary experience to remember!,"We had a wonderful dinner for two at Thevar. We experienced the Chefs menu and impressed by the innovative and unique interpretation of the cuisine. Flavours were fresh and surprising and produce used was of top quality. I loved most if the items in the extensive menu. The wagyu beef and dessert were my favourites.    For a two Michelin star establishment, the staff was endearingly casual and friendly and it wasn't a formal or stuffy environment at all.    Last but not the least, the port wine suggested by our maitre d deserves a review of its own.    Highly recommended!"

Thevar,50,FLAWLESS - simple as that!,"When I first booked Thevar I was somewhat daunted by the price and what I expected from my meal and experience.    I shouldn't have worried a single bit however!    The meal was constructed in a brilliant way, and I was sat at the counter, so watched how seamlessly the kitchen operated.    I had the honour of having a number of dishes presented and explained to me by chef Mano Thevar himself. The level of his food is incredible, but meeting such a humble and down to earth chef made the experience that much more special.    Simply perfect from start to finish!    I cant wait to go back! 😀"

Thevar,50,Worth a trip !,"Excellent meal!!!    We had to come here after reading about it and our favourable experience at revolver. The venue, pacing of the meal served, the ambience were all very good but the best bit was their staff who were very interactive and we had a great time chatting. Food did not disappoint and the flavours were awesome. Highly recommended."

Thevar,50,"Unbelievably good, best Indian food I have ever had","I found Thevar on the Michelin site and was intrigued by them adding another star this year. We went for the second seating of the night at 8:30pm and when we got to the restaurant, we were seated at a table for eight, right by the entrance. We were the only ones at the table with lots of very much appreciated privacy and an excellent view of the kitchen. We ordered the set menu with the wine pairing. The welcome was very warm, and we felt right at home. The chef also personally welcomed us, and it was great to see his very humble and super friendly attitude. Then the food started coming and offered one feast of the mouth after the other. The flavors were amazing and the texture of the food was very surprising and interesting throughout. Right from the start the appetizers were just blowing us away and the wine pairings were spot on! The waitstaff was incredibly well knowledgeable on both food and wine on top of being really friendly and on top of all our needs. The vide of the restaurant that seat about 20 people was lively and far from stuffy. The dance of the chefs and watching the food come out of the kitchen was great entertainment and mad ethe 2.5-hour sating fly by.  Course after course did not fail to amaze and the portions were spot on. I do noy like eating that late usually, but this meal did not cause me to go to bed feeling unreasonably full.  After we finished our meal we got another visit by the chef-owner, it was really nice to receive a goodbye and it allowed us to share our love for his food. If you, like us, go to Singapore for the food, Thevar is a must. We will certainly return!"

Thevar,50,Best restaurant I been too in Singapore!,"If you want to treat someone special for their birthday, this is the place to go and wow them! I would definitely come back again to THEVAR!"

Thevar,50,"Delicious, Innovative and Special","Considering I went to THEVAR for two of my four dinners in Singapore I would say that I loved my experience.    The food is special. A modern interpretation of Indian with heavy influences from Malaysia, the menu is unique and mouth watering. A trio of small bites began my evening and I was immediately caught off guard. The wildly different flavors and textures jumping around in my mouth had never been experienced. There was delicious tuna, pork belly, tomato tartlet each infused with spices that speak on one hand traditional but at Thevar become something entirely new. The meal progresses with a beautiful oyster dish, another fish preparation and then a chicken roti that I would equate with the best street taco you’ve ever tasted. The main dish was a tandoor lamb and lamb biryani that was cooked to perfection and bonkers delicious. On night two, chef swapped this out for a gorgeous sea bass and fish biryani that bested the lamb one. Again, I’ve never had fish biryani but I am now a fan. The evening ends with a gorgeous granita and a beautiful desert full of texture and taste. The service was perfect from the moment I was greeted. It is not a pretentious restaurant at all. While most two star Michelin restaurants would worry about silverware, napkin service, and the like, Thevar has perfect service but wants you to relax and enjoy your evening. The music is fun, the wine list is unique and delicious and the chef and staff are friendly and inviting, This is like having the most amazing meal ever in a good friends house. Thevars food is well worth its two stars and is unlike ANYTHING I’ve tasted. Bravo. I hope I come back to Singapore to sit at the chefs table and continue my culinary experience."

Thevar,50,Exceptional!,Dish after dish of delicious flavours! worthy of their stars! everything was just good. Service was spot on too.

Thevar,10,"Hyped, not worth it!",I know ten other non Michelin restaurants that serve better food with ten times more passion and interest. I don’t care for Michelin stars but someone in my family does so here we were on one unfortunate evening. We reached on time at 5:30pm for...More

Thevar,50,Lovely Michelin Star Restaurant,"Original, considered Indian malay fine dining, great chefs menu for vegetarian and non vegetarian alike."

Thevar,50,"Well deserving of 2 Michelin stars, extraordinary!","Visited for dinner and every course blew our minds, great kudos to everyone in the kitchen team and service crew (special mention to Ram, keep it up!!) 😊 Must visit!"

Thevar,50,A burst of flavours,"An excellent tasting menu of fusion Indian food, with the flavours coming through beautifully in each course. Highly recommended"

Thevar,50,Extraordinary,This Restaurant is really innovativ- Fusion cooking at its best. Oriental-asian- mix. very Kind staff- perfect Service. Looking forward to a second visit soon.

Thevar,50,Couples Dinner,Fabulous couple dinner! As always food and service consistent. Brought friends to try as they’ve never been and they were impressed with the food. Congratulations on being #92 at Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants! Keep up the good work team Thevar!

Thevar,50,Delicious,Thank you chef Thevar and team for a very delicious dinner and friendly hospitality. Innovative cuisine with south east asian style.

Thevar,50,Birthday for Graxe,"Sit at the counter! The food is beyond reproach, the service impeccable! The chef himself is humble and soft spoken, and the team is great. Shoutout to Elgin, masterful sommelier, attentive and cheerful"

Thevar,50,Great dining experience,"The food was amazing - intriguing, flavourful, simply delicious! The staff were warm and attentive. A wonderful dining experience"

Thevar,50,Excellent food and service,Really enjoyed my meal. Dishes were very well thought out. I love the balanced flavours and creative use of ingredients.

Thevar,50,Best Experience,"Wow! Whether it is the booking experience, follow through on diet needs, serving sequence, taste, quality, quantity- you name it, every aspect was simply superb."

Thevar,50,talented & artistic. good value,interesting twist to indian cuisine. artistically presented. pleasant to the eye and deliciously executed.

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,"2 Michelin star food, views and service","Amazing service, the best views in Singapore and a one of a kind tasting menu for the country. Staff were very welcoming and friendly - Chef Kirk visited all tables. They accommodated for a dietary requirement with ease."

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,40,Great meal with great view,"I had a good experience at Jaan. Service is smooth, professional and friendly. Dinner tasting menu is great, with nice tableware. Some dishes taste average, however they come with great details and nice presentation."

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Dinner at the top,"Another wonderful dinner though the chef is away at the michelin awards tonight. From the amuse bouche to the petit fours, every dish is very good to excellent. The main of guinea fowl was outstanding. Very good service"

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,A truly unforgettable experience - stunning view & amazing food,"Went for dinner to celebrate my birthday. Chose this place because I’m not all that familiar with British food and I wanted to give it a try and it’s one of the best decisions I ever made because JAAN absolutely blew me away!    First and foremost, the view of the restaurant is stunning and the decor was stylish. Service was impeccable. Now don’t get me started on the food - it’s one of the best, if not the best meal I’ve ever had! You can see why they have 2 Michelin stars, it’s definitely not just for show.    For drinks, we asked our server for recommendations and got a champagne and a glass of wine (unfortunately I forgot the names), and both were impressive! I don’t drink much but I enjoyed both a lot. I’ve never had champagne before but you bet I’m definitely gonna get more next time, was raving about it even after the meal. The wine was also absolutely fantastic.    As for the food, every single course was full of surprises. Everything was very exquisite and both the presentation and taste were a delight. The goose mousse was lovely, and the roast leek & potato soup was full of flavour, definitely some of the best soup I had. Even after the meal, I find myself keep thinking back about it. The squab pigeon was really the highlight of the meal. Tender, savoury, with a thin layer of fragrant and crispy crust on the surface, even the turnip that came with the dish was sweet and flavourful. The strawberry eton mess was very refreshing and I polished off my plate quickly. Words can’t express how much I enjoyed myself.    Highly, highly recommended! If the chance comes up again, I’m definitely going back for more!"

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Exquisite food journey,An exquisite food journey! Excellent service; we enjoyed our interaction with the service staff. Kirk even came by to say hello. We will definitely be back to celebrate many more special occasions at Jaan.

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,An Impeccable Reinvented Experience,"Elaine and Kelly took care of my reservations and delivered on their promise- a lovely window seat. But the views are not why you come here. The waitstaff was helpful, every ready-to-serve any request and explained every course and the appropriate sequence/method to truly enjoy the dishes.  Chef Kirk Westaway got out in the dining room, stopped by our table to check on our meal, and truly made us feel special.  2 Michelin stars indeed with a team that clearly put in the work and I’ll definitely be recommending Jaan for its reinvented British cuisine."

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Birthday dinner,2-Star Michelin worth the price and service. Food was superb.    The dishes was paced just right. Took us about 3 hours. Dishes looks small in serving portion but by dessert time we were full.    Every single dish was pleasing to the eye and the taste was divine.    Great attention service.

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Great dinner,I had an awesome dinner at Jaan. Everything cooked and presented was cooked perfectly. I have no complains. I might visit the restaurant again.

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Excellent food,"The dining experience at Jaan by Kirk Westaway was really special. I had requested for a window side table and we did manage to get one, though it was in the corner, which was a 4 on 5. The menu is quite nice and we were really enjoyed the variety and presentation of each dish. The appetizers were delicious and I liked their presentation. The only 2 dishes that we didn’t like was the Pigeon (a bit gamey) and the 36 hour cured Wagyu beef (which I got as a replacement of the pigeon). To be honest by the time the mains came we were quite full with the food and the gorgeous Portuguese wine we drank. Each dish was really well presented, though the explanation of the dish by the serving staff could do with a bit more tuning. We had to ask a few times to explain what the dish was. Some finesse would be good from a Michelin 2 ⭐️ ⭐️ perspective. I must say that I really enjoyed Kirk’s representation of the quintessential British food…. Definitely unique and interesting with the flavors, textures and style.    Overall, the staff was courteous and friendly. I would suggest them to consider serving some cheese along with a aperitif of some sort, as part of the experience versus the additional charge. The dessert was also delicious, I preferred the chocolate cake over the strawberry dessert, which was quite light and delectable as well. It was also nice meeting Kirk in person. I have dined in several top 50 Asian restaurants and this too was a nice box to check. The decor is a bit underwhelming, the white table cloth, flower selection etc. on the table needs to be spruced. We would like to revisit the place, perhaps for some lunch this time, so we can skip dinner that day given the amount of food we get to eat."

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Singapore trip last year,"The place for relaxation ,I will not forget it.the staff very kind , Finally everything perfect . Recommended for stay in vacation."

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Exquisite experience,"Every course of the set was an interesting yet undeniably tasty mix of flavours. Service was friendly and top-notch (thanks to Glen and his team!), and the views of the city and Bay are amazing. The rye sourdough bread is one of the best we've tasted so much so that we brought some home."

JAAN by Kirk Westaway,50,Summertime in “England”,"Had the Summertime 7-course Modern British lunch overlooking the beautiful city view of Singapore.    It was an impeccable experience from the beginning till the end of my time there with my friend.    Food was well executed for their summer menu edition. Especially the “Potato & leek soup”, “sweet tomato” and the main course (chicken). The soup was just simple and nice warm comforting dish that simply reminds me of home. With a strong start to the courses with a rather simple and beautifully plated “Sweet tomato”. Look simple. Sounded rather basic but soon after you had the first bite... the mind was blown off. The balance of the acidity and the sweetness with the overall texture was so well presented. I would really loved to have more of that! After which my next most beloved course was the main course, chicken. I must say, it was the best chicken that me and my friend had ever have it in Singapore. Highly recommended to try their cheeseboard too for an alternative to classic french cheeses. English should deserve their attention for that too especially the Devonshire cheddar cheese (that was where chef Kirk was from) we chose from their cheese trolley ! It was divinely delicious with such a lovely complex profile!    Service was top notch with Rashelle that had kept us accommodating throughout our meal along with the manager, Glen that has been very hospitable and made us felt home and cosy all throughout the time. John the Assitant sommelier was too a very lovely charming guy.    Overall, the team deserve a great compliments from their hard work and I’ll definitely be recommending Jaan for the modernised British cuisine."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Deserves the 3 Michelin star,"3 michelin star 10 seater counter sushi place that needs a reservation. Some of my favorites here include Uni from Miyagi prefecture with corn pudding, fresh Takobutsu, and the Hairy Crab on Wintermelon puree."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Excellent food. Excellent Chef. Excellent service.,Food was outstanding with excellent preparation. Highly recommended. Our private tour guide recommended this longstanding restaurant in the heart of Tokyo.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,nice,after visiting sushi shikon in hong kong we were happy to be able to dine at sushi yoshitake. the high expectations were fulfilled and the evening was funny in the end as some guests and the chef were smart entertainers. beautiful new location.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The best sushi place on this planet,"Continuing to win six Michelin stars, the master sushi chef Mr Yoshitake is a legendary! So many appetizers makes one so happy. Better to book thru hotel concierge. Definitely the best is Ginza, Tokyo, Japan and this planet!! ミシュラン6つ星シェフの吉武さんの寿司は芸術の域を越えてます。握り前に頂く品々でノックダウン。最高の職人技に誰もが満足することでしょう。"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best Sushi I've ever had in my life,"After a friend got us a reservation which you have to do long in advance, we were in for a treat.  The whole experience was nothing short of amazing and all the details were thought of. Service was great on all fronts and Yoshitake is a true culinary wizard. Not cheap but worth the expense"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Do not miss this place,"If you want a super special sushi, don’t miss Yoshitake. The menu is exquisite, the service is fantastic and the food does not require a review. I would go back a thousand times!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,"Wow, just spectacular","This restaurant is in a very nondescript building in one of the backstreets off the main Ginza strip. It wasn't hard to find but do your research before hand. This is a 7 seater restaurant so take note there is a cancellation policy. It wasn't easy getting a reservation for this place as they only open up reservations at the certain time and it gets booked out quickly. I was lucky and got my reservation via my hotel concierge 2 months before my trip.  Master Yoshitake-san was very friendly. I was the only non-Japanese speaker in that sitting and he took time to explain everything he was serving to me in English.  The meal started of with some cooked appetizers and sashimi. I have to say they were incredible. From the monkfish liver to the bonito in a bonito broth to octopus. The stand out for me was the abalone in an abalone liver sauce. It was bursting with flavour and the sauce was deliciously decadent and creamy.  There were quite a lot of courses (8) served before the sushi course began. And then a total of 14 pieces of sushi were served. It was an extremely filling dinner, and I was very full at the end which is unusual for me.  As for the sushi, Master Yoshitake uses a red vinegar in his shari apparently, which gives it a brownish tint. His shari was mild and perfectly complimented the fish. Every single piece I had was spectacular, but my favourites were the lightly smoked yellowtail, of course the chutoro and otoro, the 2 types of uni, the kuruma-ebi and the anago.  The meal was just fantastic. i think this will be my go to splurge restaurant in Tokyo now (if I can get a reservation that is!). Just outstanding."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,We had an amazing time - delicious sushi and great ambiance!,"Nestled amongst the buildings at the back of Ginza, we finally pin-pointed the correct building and made our way up in the lift. We opened the sliding door and was met by the maitre-d in western bow tie, black vest and pants. He verified our names and asked us to wait a bit as we were early.    Within a couple of minutes, we were ushered in. The head chef greeted us and his team looked up from their work and also greeted us warmly. We felt most welcomed. This small, Michelin star restaurant has 7 counter seats only. Booking is essential. We did this via our hotel about a month in advance. Bookings need to be made for the next month, preferably at the beginning of the month before. Our hotel did the booking for us at the beginning of August to dine in September. So far, we noted that Peninsula Tokyo and Palace Hotel have been able to secure bookings at these hard to get restaurants.    I ordered sake and it was recommended that we move from the first carafe at the top of the sake menu to the next, as the meal progresses. We enjoyed the sake very much and ended up consuming 3 carafes [180ml each]    The meal is ""omakase"" [translated to ""as the chef pleases'] with lots of preparation that goes into the meal. A small paper menu in English is laid up on the table for us to follow the meal course. The left side was mostly sashimi-style with some type of accompaniment. Example - the freshly grilled eel was accompanied by edamame soup with dollop of caviar.    This lot of courses showcased the depth of talent at Yoshitake. Much of the flavours of the fish were well paired with other preparations made by the chefs. The chefs worked very well together and you can tell that they enjoyed their tasks.    The head chef was ably assisted by a younger assistant and he helped grate the wasabi, chop the fish, prepare the fish for smoking, and heated up the seaweed for the final Temaki handroll, amongst other things. There's a chef team in the kitchen, prepping or cooking the food. They all integrated well as a team and it was really nice to see such a well-oiled machine.    The sushi course started after the team sliced the respective fish variety, bathed it in soya sauce or further preparations. Once half the sushi course were lined up in a Parade Square manner, the chef-owner dipped his hands in cold water and started to prepare the sushi and deliver it to his patrons. He was always careful to deliver the tasty morsels from left to right, then from right to left; with each patron or family given a chance to receive their sushi first.    The head-chef was talkative and interacted well with two Japanese ladies. He also talked to the other couple and us three. He also gently chided my son for slouching half on the table and half against the corner, telling him he had to sit up straight for receive his sashimi. When my wife and I started an animated conversation about the peeling process of the prawns, he laughed and asked us what was happening.    We had a vey pleasant dining experience. Our dinner booking was for 8.30pm, and we did not end till 10.15pm. We hung around a little more before saying our thanks in Japanese and moving off. The meal here was more reasonable than our previous Michelin star Sushi meal - with more courses and more sake.    This is a certainly a great sushi practitioner and well worth the Michelin star. Ee certainly enjoyed ourselves with such amazing food and such warm company. We will return another day!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The Very Authentic and Interesting Experience,"This is a very small restaurant but the attention to detail and the way the whole experience is delivered was a one off experience. While you will get a very personal experience in other places, SY takes it to a whole different level. Every mouthful is skillfully constructed.    It mist be noted that if you're out for a relaxed night out that this is not the place. This is about an intense food focused experience."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The best Sushi experience ever..,"I been here invite by a japanese colleague,otherwise apparently is not easy to dine here,  The restaurant is open only in dinner time, and is always full, you have 2hours for enjoy your dinner, they not give you a menu a la carte but is fix from the chef, that is preparing in front of you and is just amazing and also what I loved is the commune table we was sitting 7 peoples on the counter and most of us not know each others.. in the end of the dinner you have new friends.."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Worth every penny,"Had Visa Concierge help make the reservation and is still one of the few restaurants that allow for a 3rd party to make reservations for you. Some hotels wont even help make the reservation while some of the sushi restaurants only will take hotel concierge reservations. A month before heading out to Japan, our chances to get into a nice sushi restaurant seemed very slim but Visa Concierge came through for 4 people at 8:30pm in the private room. The food was local. The flavors were amazing. The Chef himself, was cheerful and spoke English very well. He made us laugh and feel comfortable. We had 3 carafes of sake and it came out to a total of 325 per person. Would I do it again? yes. Was it worth it? yes."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,What a Treat!,"We really enjoyed our evening at Sushi Yoshitake. There are only seven counter seats and Chef Yoshitake presides. There are almost as many staff who keep drinks filled and help prepare the tasting menu. The dinner takes about two hours for you to eat and enjoy each morsel. The staff were very friendly and spoke English. We felt very welcomed, almost as if we were in Chef's home. This is a very expensive night out but if you can go for it we recommend it. We have been to many Michelin starred restaurants throughout the world and this was yet another unique and very special evening to be remembered."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,The gem of Tokyo. One of the best I ever have.,"Late review of Sushi Yoshitake. Chef Yoshitake is one of the top Sushi chefs that stands at the pinnacle of the art together with Jiro and Saito. The restaurant is located at a inconspicuous building which took me awhile to find. In short, a middle age lady suddenly approached and asked me whether I am looking for Sushi Yoshitake. At the restaurant, Chef Yoshitake was very friendly and warm throughout and the service of other staff was impeccable. Every slice of sushi and sashimi was made with the freshest fish. So fresh and sweet that it made all other sushi and sashimi I ever had, except Shinji and Shoukouwa, an insult to what sushi and sashimi should be. All the sashimi simply melted in my mouth. The assortment sushi and sashimi carried various taste to the max: fresh, mild, rich, buttery, firm, subtle, sweet, and brine. Few dishes stood up among the rest of the treasure. Steamed abalone with abalone liver sauce. The creamy, deep and a combination of egg plus foie gras taste. The option to have the remaining of the sauce with top grade Japanese rice was simply marvelous. The sea urchin, fatty tuna and unagi sushi caught my attention as well. The rich, buttery, and briny taste of the sea urchin was so delicious that it reminisces the ocean. I lost words with the fatty tuna and unagi sushi. The fatty tuna and unagi evaporated once they reached your mouth. Minimum chewing effort was required as they slide down my throat. Fat, creamy, and rich coupled with the perfect sushi skills. Now I can no longer go back to ordinary sushi. Next time in Japan, I will definitely try Jiro and Saito. For now, only Shinji and Shoukouwa can satisfy my palate. Not forgetting to mention, Chef Yoshitake was warm and professional enough to greet each and every customer when they leave and I managed to take pictures with him."

Sushi Yoshitake,30,Not Enjoyable Dining Experience,"We chose Sushi Yoshitake mainly based on reviews saying that it was friendlier to foreigners compared to other high end sushi restaurants. In our personal experience, this was not the case. There were 6 of us at the counter: 3 foreigners and 3 Japanese speakers. From the start, it was plainly obvious that the chef was selecting certain cuts for the Japanese speakers. Of course, he is free to do as he pleases, but it didn't make us feel exactly welcomed. As the dinner progressed, I could sense the chefs passing judgment on the other foreigner diner, who was neither loud nor ridiculous.    All in all, the food was good. However not good enough to compensate for the unpleasant dining experience. If you're someone like me who enjoys sushi, but not enough to pay money to be uncomfortable, I'd go to Kyubei instead."

Sushi Yoshitake,20,Service & Techniques over Taste,"This restaurant highlights my opinion that the Michelin Guide is more about experience than Taste.    As mentioned earlier, this restaurant is located in the difficult to find  すずりゅ:suzuryu building. The outside of the building is dirty & scummy, though inside was immaculate.    Opinions of this place often state that the Otsumami here are better than the Nigiri - personally I preferred the Nigiri over the Otsumami while my Japanese dining companion didn't enjoy the red akazu vinegar used in the sushi rice.    Overall I thought that the menu was about subtlety and restraint created through innovative textures & techniques rather than TASTE!    Noteworthy Dishes:    Braised Octopus: had a brilliant colour & been well massaged, making it very easy to eat.    The famous Abalone in Liver sauce For Me was a letdown - whilst the Abalone had a noticeable smokey flavour, I found it to be too chewy and not tender enough, and overshadowed by the awesomeness of the Liver sauce.    Frozen squid - this had one of the most interesting textures of any dish I've eaten.    Double Hokkaido Uni Gunkan - Easily the Best dish of the Entire Meal - the Only thing on the menu that gave me that Angels accompanied by Heavenly Trumpets feeling.    Overall I'd consider the food here to be Very Good, but I was expecting more Taste Wise from a 3 star restaurant charging $250 a head. Both me and my dining companion agreed we much preferred the Kaiseki at Kyubey"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Amazing Sushi Dinner Experience,"I wanted one excellent Sushi dinner and really wanted Jiro because of the hype but only tried 2 weeks before and couldn't get it. This was my second choice and I was flexible and only one so I got in. Generally recommend you book a few weeks before. As it turns out, I am thrilled it worked out this way.  Food was five star plus. A mix of raw and slightly cooked prepared and presented in a thoughtful exciting manner. Chef (owner) was extremely friendly and spoke a couple of words in English but that was enough to make it a great time. For approx $300 US you will eat sushi like a king in a pleasant space and enjoy the experience which will last approx 2 1/2 hours, far longer than the short experience at Jiro. Every single piece of food was delicious and memorable.  Would and will go back at a moment's notice (If I could get a seat!)"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Really wonderful experience,"Really terrific meal. It is a splurge, for sure, but it's one of those meals you should splurge for. You will seat at a counter for around 7 people, all start at once (you MUST be there promptly!), and two chefs will work inches from your face preparing all manner of ocean goodness. It is fascinating to watch them work, and delicious to taste the results. There are so many individual items served to you, one at a time, that you will not walk away hungry (though I had initially feared that I would). The sushi is prepared with rice served so warm and tender that the advice - in this elegant place! - is to eat it with your fingers just a few seconds after it is placed in front of you. I am drooling thinking about it as I write the review."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Suburashi des ! Nihon Ichi 7 ... no 8 stars !,"Ladies and Gents I have eaten many meals in many places.  I lie not when I say that was the most amazing meal I have ever had.  The depth of flavour, the artistry.. sheer delight.  Yes it ain't cheap but boy if you have to choose something for the bucket list .. choose this.  Just awesome the monkfish live was my favourite."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Amazing meal!!!!!!!,This is one of the Michelin dining experience and definitely the best sushi we ever had. We had a private room and an amazing chef who prepared super delicious food for us. The total came out to be about $550 usd for two people which is pricy but worth the experience!!

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Go!,"6 diners at the counter in very close proximity to the chef and his assistants. Almost fanatical attention to detail. My husband was instructed to eat his sushi immediately and not wait for me. You will fall in love with sea urchin. There were 2 different ones served in a maki roll. The nori was grilled over charcoal in front of us. The contrast between the warm rice, crisp nori and cold sweet uni was sublime. 3rd floor of a nondescript brick building on a back street, give yourself plenty of time as they start service on the dot!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,One of the best meals we've ever eaten,My wife and I had a truly exceptional meal here. Chef Yoshitake is considered to be one of the three greatest sushi chefs alive and his artistry and talent were very evident the night we ate there. If you can get a reservation grab it.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Amazing,What a special meal! It is so cool to be able to sit in such a small space and be served by one of the world's best sushi chefs. We had 18 courses and each was unique and absolutely mind blowing. Loved the steamed abalone and the fatty tuna. All were amazing.    Not an inexpensive meal to be sure but if you are looking for something special look no further.

Sushi Yoshitake,50,BEST sushi restaurant we have ever been to...,"My husband and I travel alot. When we travel to Tokyo, which is one of our more frequent destinations, we always book the Michelin Starred restaurants to try. They might not always be THE best, but the list is pretty ""safe"" to say it's good and high quality restaurants.    We have been to many sushi restaurants around the world, and all around Japan. We are NOT easy to be impressed. Sushi Yoshitake is now the TOP on my list of sushi restaurants, and probably one of the very top restaurants we have ever been to. Ledbury in London, and Sushi Yoshitake in Tokyo. Never forget again.    The quality of sushi here is impeccable. We had the luxury and luck of getting a private room and the chef Dai was the most professional and best sushi chef we have ever had. The atmosphere, the quality of sushi, the menu planning, the professional service, the pace, the price.... absolutely flawless.    It's really hard to book a reservation. Book through your hotel concierge is your best chance, and must be quite well in advance.    The entrance of the building doesn't even indicate any signage outside. It's hard to find actually. The building looks very drabby. The entrance of the restaurant is unnoticeable. When we arrived at 810pm, (reservation at 830pm), we didn't see any entrance to any restaurant. It looked like a really drabby old building that looks deserted. Then we looked carefully, and walked to wards a grey colour very old door. There was a paper that said, THIS DOOR OPENS only at 620pm and 820pm.    That was shocking to us actually. We thought there would be a waiting area for us even if we arrived early. There isn't. So arrive on time. The policy is very strict. If you no show, you will be charged for the full price. If you are late, they have the right to cancel your reservation, and you will be charged as well.    So don't be late if you have a reservation at Sushi Yoshitake.    I cannot wait to go again next time we go to Tokyo."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,I went to Hesven and came back!!!,"Best Sushi in my life. If you come to Tokyo you cannot Miss this Restaurant. Amazon good, great chef! Don't change anything from the menú, it's just perfect!!!"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Please do not leave Tokyo without trying this restaurant!,"This is my favorite sushi place in Tokyo (I've been to Jiro's). It's a welcoming place where Chef Yoshitake and his staff are quite nice. Why do I like it so much? For me, this restaurant has the best sushi rice I've ever had. In terms of the omakase, their selection of the fish is also been excellent. It's one of those meals you wish wouldn't end because it's so good. It can be difficult to get a seat but worth trying as it would be a miss to leave Tokyo without going here."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Sushi at the Highest Level,"We wanted to experience sushi at the highest level and chose Yoshitake for its 3 star Michelin rating. We had our concierge at the Park Hyatt make the reservation for us a month in advance, as Yoshitake doesn't take reservations more than one month out. The sushi bar (main dining room) only has 7 seats at the bar and only two separate seating times so one can imagine the challenge of obtaining one. There is also a small private dining room, but I highly recommend sitting at the bar to have the full dining experience of watching and interacting with chef Yoshitake as he prepares your food. Yoshitake-San spoke English very well and explained each dish as he presents it to us. He was very cordial and answered any questions that we had. Not once did we feel intimidated to ask him any questions. My wife was hesitant of the few items ( uni, octopus, and squid) due to past experiences, but she was amazed how wonderful they were prepared by chef Yoshitake and how excellent they taste. This was truly an amazing experience for us - from the attentive service to the excellent execution of the food to the exceptional quality and taste. It was a dining experience that we will remember for a long time. Sushi Yoshitake will be the measuring stick by which we will measure future sushi restaurants."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Awesome Sushi,"This is the best Sushi I've ever had. Very difficult to book and we are lucky to book the last two seats during our stay. Chef has fantastic technique and offer Omakase. There is only 7 seats available for each slot. There is no lunch served and two slots for dinner, 6PM to 8PM and 8:30PM to 10:30PM. Sunday is off."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Exquisite,"In a small building in Ginza, this is a tiny 7 seater. Amazing. Omakase course that started with a few dishes like grilled fish, sashimi , boiled abalone (their specialty). Then the parade of about 12 exquisite pieces of sushi began. Each more delicious than the previous. Incredible meal"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best sushi ever,"The plaudits are well deserved. I even managed to get past the uni, which is usually too much of a barrier for me. Best sushi I've ever had."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Sublime,"Came here last month for a business dinner and was so impressed that I decided to spend my birthday dinner here again when I returned to Tokyo with my wife and another couple. All four of us have eaten pretty good sushi elsewhere in Tokyo and Hong Kong, but we all agreed that Yoshitake is at another level of its own. I haven't had the good fortune of eating in the main dining room (with a whooping size of 7 diners), but have always been served by Dai in the smaller private room. I'm sure we are not the only ones to get lost finding the restaurant in a most unimpressive building on a side street in Ginza. Nor would we be the only ones to stare in disbelief when shown the little hole in the wall that we had to crawl through to get to the private room for four. But I like the cozy atmosphere and I like Dai a lot. A LOT! He's attentive, friendly, funny, ultra serious about his art, obsessed with the jewels in front of him, caressing/slicing/dicing them in various ways just to make them explode with freshness and flavours in your mouth. Several times his delicate creations brought tears in my eyes... literally. It's an other worldly experience to dine there and I surely recommend it to everyone who can afford. You won't regret it."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,An unbelievable experience,"This was by far the most amazing meal of my life for many reasons    We were sitting in the main room which seats 7, right at the counter. Yoshitake came and welcomed us and chatted for a while. He also explained all the dishes in english - all the other guests were Japanese - and even poured and refilled our drinks which was a bit surreal!    The food was incredible and surprising and so fresh. The tuna was nearly glowing it was so fresh. The meal started with some cooked and combination dishes which were all extremely delicate and then the second half was all sushi. Dishes I was a bit nervous of (squid, octopus and eel) were all beautiful and the sea urchin was probably one of the nicest things I've ever eaten    This was an incredible experience and I will never forget it"

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Unbelievable experience in the private room!,"I dined with two friends in the private room and had an unbelievable sushi experience. To put things into perspective, we enjoyed Sawada, Hashiguchi and Harutaka within a week prior to this and we all agreed this was the best experience. I usually don't make reviews but I feel a duty to share my recommendation with TripAdvisor users as this was truly an unforgettable experience. If you are considering between multiple sushi restaurants then beware that 'best' is very subjective and much of the differences people report on are based on a difference in style (rather than being 'better/worse' or the 'best'). Different sushi masters have different styles of art, different rice composition, temperature, wasabi or vinegar strengths etc. These are all intentional and will come down to preference.    I noticed a few of the lower rated reviews mentioned being seated in the private room as a huge downside, enough to warrant 1* in some cases.. Any respectable concierge will tell you in ADVANCE if you are going to be seated in the private room. We knew going into the experience this was the case, and there are certainly some advantages. The privacy of being only amongst your own company can give a more intimate and comfortable experience, and the chef (Dai) was clearly an expert master. If you are going for a single place, of course I would suggest trying to get seated in the main room or with a chef in general as the experience is as important as the actual food.    I would also highly recommend ignoring any reviews that directly compare the restaurant to ""Jiro"" - as this almost always means a tourist who doesn't know anything about sushi. Giving a review of 1* just because the (unknowledgeable) diner thought (based on their non-experienced) it wasn't as good as the over-hyped Jiro is ridiculous..  So, I will not say this is the 'best' sushi in the world or similar. I will simply say I think the reviews speak for themselves and we had the best overall experience here overall.    Everything was great but highlights include the double-uni, house-specialty abalone and liver sauce, all tuna (toro, chu-toro and otoro).."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Fantastic food and reception,"Great host. Great staff. Definitely the best sushi experience I've ever had. But comes at a price. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Tokyo who can afford to splash out. A couple of other places in Tokyo may offer the same quality of sushi, but the graciousness and warmth of Yoshitake San and the rest of the team has been incomparable."

Sushi Yoshitake,50,Best sushi,Best sushi ever! Definitely worth the visit. We enjoyed it more than jiro - more relaxed atmosphere and enjoyable experience.

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,An Unforgettable Dining Experience in Provence,"My group of 12 was in Rouret for a very large, nearby family reunion (cousinade). We stayed in the Hotel du Clos for 5 nights and a few weeks before we arrived I was able to arrange a family luncheon for our group of 12 at the Le Clos Saint Pierre. The restaurant was incredibly accommodating to a variety of needs -e.g. 2 vegetarians and some pretty picky eaters. The food was outstanding, from the appetizers and amuse bouche, to entrees and dessert, and including the recommended wines. We ate on the patio which was well-shaded and breezy. The service was amazing; the staff could not have been more gracious and attentive. While some in our group spoke a little French, we were able to communicate very well with the entire staff. We will soon not forget our leisurely, 3 hour lunch and are looking to come back next year to eat at this Michelin-starred restaurant in the middle of Provence. And don’t forget to book ahead or you will be out of luck."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Lovely secluded local restaurant- away from the tourists,Lovely evening - secluded terrace - lots of local people - very friendly staff. Set menu - food mostly very good - a little unbalanced (delicate appetizers - huge (delicious) dessert).

Le Clos Saint Pierre,30,"A little disappointing, tbh.","Looked forward to the evening we were to dine here, given the Michelin fine dining narrative, but whilst acknowledging it’s a small restaurant, I did expect more choice on the menu than two entrees and one main course. The lamb main was well cooked, but a simple dish with little to differentiate it from other meals we enjoyed in France. The starter was better, though I can’t remember what it was - unmemorable(!) Cheese okay. Dessert- again nothing spectacular and somewhat spoiled for me by the fact the waiter had forgotten I’d told him I was allergic to nuts- he had the good grace to admit it, but if you’re eating here do check if you have dietary sensitivity. Wine average for the price/location. About €220 for two of us, so the sort of price you’d expect for a good meal- sorry we didn’t enjoy one. Strange there’s only one other review in the last 12 months…."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Perfection,"Beautiful surroundings, exquisite food and charming staff. They presented our two and five year old grandchildren with delicious fish and vegetables, the best menu enfant I’ve ever seen. A truly delightful restaurant."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,All you can ask for.............,"There are plenty of good descriptions below so I won't bang on, but 4 of us came for dinner last week and it was as good as ever. The set menu was wonderful and also makes one have something one might not ordinarily have tried, so gets you out of your comfort zone to excellent effect.  The service was perfect and a good wine list for all wallets.  Setting is perfect too  This is a quintessential French village restaurant and if you are nearby is an absolute must."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,"Delicious food, excellent friendly service, pretty setting and absolutely nothing could be better than celebrating there","The limited menu of delicious dishes, makes life so easy. One can concentrate on enjoying the company of those with one.  The evening starts with a plate to share of radishes and little fresh cheese flavored warm bread.  After which we had the most delicious meal of firstly sea bass, followed by beef with a wonderful light old fashioned taste, which we all thoroughly enjoyed despite rarely eating meat. Some of us had a small selection of cheese and finally we all savoured fresh strawberries and ice-cream."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,The perfect mid-week luncheon venue,"What a wonderful restaurant this is. Situated in an unassuming location, the Clos St. Pierre offers a delicious meal in a cosy terrace setting on this lovely September day. Not a restaurant for those who expect to have lengthy or à la carte menus from which to choose. One dines on the chef's freshly chosen ingredients, prepared in a delicate and appetising way. We have been here numerous times, both for lunch and dinner. Of the two, I think we will tend towards lunch for our next visit. September is also recommended -- away from the summer crowds."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,A Perfect Sunday Lunch!,"We came here today for Sunday lunch with a friend, and had a perfect time as always.  The weather was glorious so everyone ate on the terrace, with more than ample social distancing.  We arrived at 12:15 and left at 3:30, enjoying first rate food, wine, service and ambiance."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Excellent food and service,We did not comeback to Provence for 2 years for health reasons and were surprised that the quality of LE CLOS ST PIERRE had not changed. The food was excellent and the service also. We came for Lunch and ate once inside and twice on the terrace. We come once a week. The wine list is excellent but they did not have the BEAUCASTEL CUVÉE PERRIN.. We recommend people visiting Nice to try it.

Le Clos Saint Pierre,20,STOP!!,Something must have happened during COVID. We took dear friends there for a first dinner based on recommandations and it was a joke. The food was average and unimaginative. Tuna carpaccio was overpowered by the dressing and red peppers. 1/3 of an “entrecôte” served with a third of a potato and a cauliflower head. The joke became obvious when the server negotiated for only bringing 2 out of the four cheese plates included in the menu. The cheese plate was a white plate and three average piece of cheese on it. Reminded of me of a cafeteria. La poire belle Hélène was boring. One of the waitresses had dirty fingernails. The bill was €65 by person!!! Michelin need to come back and reassess. And the chef needs a wake up call. We are not coming back

Le Clos Saint Pierre,10,"One of my favourite restaurants, however very bad social distancing.","This is one of my favorite restaurants in the South of France. Really, it is that good! However, and this is a big however, they have not adjusted even the outdoor seating for proper social distancing. In fact it looked the same as before this horrid Covid. Sadly, I will not eat here until it changes, which is a great disappointment for me and my friends that take social distancing seriously.    OK, there will be less patrons, so charge more! This restaurant is already at the high end in both quality and price, however it's patrons realise that these are difficult times and so adding an extra 30% to the food bill would be acceptable during the crisis. .... As long as they remove the 30% hike at the end of the crisis and do not take advantage of loyal patrons."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,40,Still very nice but portions are getting really small,"Le Clos Saint Pierre for dinner outside on the terrace under the trees offers a very romantic environment, with good friendly services. Food is excellent, we had a great risotto and also an excellent raw tuna, and the large wine selection is reasonably priced. But, the portions are getting really small, not always sufficient from my perspective. But will give an other try."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Wonderful to be back,"We hadn't visited the South of France for 15 years, and were keen to come back to this restaurant which we had always loved. We were thrilled to find it as lovely (if not more) as ever, and we had a delightful evening with our friends. The food was delicious, the service charming and it is definitely our favourite restaurant in the area."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,As good as ever,I was the last diner during Daniel’s OMG tenure as the holder of a Michelin star. As good as ever - my favourite restaurant anywhere for its blend of fresh and perfect ingredients; simplicity and elegance; great staff; a charming space - Fantastic!!!

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Memorable,After living in this region for over thirty five years and dining out on a regular basis i can honestly write this was one of best bbest.themmemmmemoramemorable

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Was here again as for several years. Never disappointed!,Have been fairly regularly here for about 25 years. Always very pleased with superb food and very excellent and attentive service. The menues are always very creative and offer new and superb tastes.

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Extremely pleasant staff.,"I have been going to their sister restaurant 'Bistro du Clos' for quite some time now.  it was my fathers birthday so we decided to take him to Le Clos for a treat. What a treat it was!!!  we arrived half an hour too early and all the staff were in the restaurant having a pre dinner service meal. Upon seeing us they all cleared the restaurant and had it laid up within minutes. The decor is very cosy. The wine list isn't as punchy as you would expect in a Michelin stared restaurant. The menu reads very well and I like the fact that there is minimal choice. The food was very good. I must say I have never had bread and BUTTER quite like it. The butter was huge, a great big slab on the table.....Great!!!!! the home baked bread just kept on coming. BUT this was all due to the staff. What a team!!! I love going to restaurant where service is effortless! Massive thumbs up.    However, if I was being really picky, it would be about the noise levels. With no carpet, very low ceiling and no pictures on the wall, it makes it very noisy. It might have been the large table of Dutch people on the table behind us but I think that if you can't beat them, join them. We did.  Wonderful, wonderful night. This place is full of locals that the hostess kisses on both cheeks upon entry, one day that will be me after several visits."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Reunion!,"Saturday lunch here for a large group of school friends catching up after almost 44 years, for some!  We joined those who had opted to relocate to France over the years to celebrate our 60th year+.  It was a very wise choice of venue, with our group seated comfortably on the terrace with lots of room to mingle, swap seats and generally spend hours catching up!  The food options on the 2 menus were great with some flexibility for changing options for those who did not wish to eat meat.  It was amazing to have the group served together with the waiter and waitress delivering our food to the appropriate customer without any need to check out their order. The wine was poured, again without any interference to our constant conversations!  We were very happy with everything about the meal, the atmosphere and lovely setting.  We plan to revisit in 2020.  We have also recommended fir French friends living in the area."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,40,Saturday lunch,"Table for 6 booked outside on the terrace for a Saturday lunch. The table was beautifully laid and the terrace was a lovely location.  Gorgeous bread and a platter of amouse bouches’ were brought out while our drinks order was being prepared. There was a choice of 2 menus, a 3 course 40€ one and a 5 course menu for around 70€.  The menus are set daily so you don’t really get much of a choice, our starter was fish soup which was delicious but a bit much for some of the group.  We were there with a 9 and 11 year old. There is no kids menu (not altogether a bad thing) but they were happy to prepare a plate of pasta and tomato sauce for the youngest whilst the eldest did his best with the main menu.  The main course was a thin beef steak cooked to perfection with a small portion of vegetables.  Dessert was a simple dish of fruit with ice cream, cream and a strip of waffle.  Overall the food was amazing and the service was outstanding but I couldn’t help feeling that the meal was perhaps a little simple for the price we paid."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Open your taste buds get ready for a palate orgy,"Le Clos St Pierre in Rouret is a 1 star Michelin rated worth well over 5 stars in our USA rating .  The lunch dégustation menu is well worth it at 50 euros and flavors so full and varied it’s perfumes for your palate. The Provençal mas décor will plant you right into a movie from Marcel Pagnol .  The service is attentive and very professional, Chef Daniel the « maître des lieux «  will come to the table and salute you then go back to his kitchen to execute a 4 courses Lunch you Will smack lips over .  You are in good hands with this master chef creations .  Bon appétit follow us at  PascalPicks *****"

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Beautiful setting for superb food,"We booked for a Sunday night and the place was filled with locals. We had just experienced the heatwave of France and this was a beautiful spot sitting on a terrace with lights, umbrellas and plants that made a superb backdrop to a splendid meal. We opted for the full menu which is not cheap but not unaffordable. The menu changes daily and the chef decides what it will be. Nothing let us down and the service and food was wonderful. We selected a local rose that was perfect for the selection of food. It was a real treat for our family in holiday. Highly recommend in this quiet part of the world if you want to experience Michelin restaurant food."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Sunday lunch,"Honestly, it doesn’t come much better than this, great service, a very good choice of menus, the food was delicious. I would recommend this place, you will need to book in advance though as it is always full"

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Superb dinner and service,"We visited for dinner at 8, we ate inside as the weather was not so good. There was a good buzz but not too busy. The staff were very helpful and despite our poor French there was no problems with translation. The set menu changes every day, with fresh produce in every dish. The food was really incredible for every course, and we both felt full at the end! I would highly recommend a visit."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,40,"Great food, presentation and service !","We had a great family/friend diner. Food, as usual was very ggod and the service was just perfect. THe only backdraw as we were inside was the noise. not sure it is the room or some of the other guess speaking too loudly but at some point it was disconfortable."

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Exceptional food,We loved our local restaurant whilst staying in le Rouret. Without a doubt the restaurant is always busy and has limited nights during the week. The asparagus dish with fresh egg mayonnaise and a choice of miniature lettuces was beyond fabulous! Great atmosphere and the best in the area .

Le Clos Saint Pierre,50,Reliable choice,"Could not fault our evening - superb service and impeccable food. This is a conventional, traditional French restaurant - just classics done well.    Only two points to note 1) there is no choice in the menu; it is all a set menu ( not an issue for us as we eat anything) and 2) there is only one wine sold by the glass.    Otherwise this is a classy restaurant clearly run by management that know what they are doing. Not cheap but excellent value for money."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Lunch at Søllerød Kro,"I haven't been visiting Søllerød Kro for quite a while, but on a day off from work it was time to visit for lunch.    Søllerød Kro is one of the few restaurant giving the diner several options: a la carte, a 3 course lunch menu, and tasting menus with either 7 or 9 courses. Tasting menus are identical, however the 9 course version includes two additional caviar servings at the beginning of the meal.    I chose the 9 course menu as well as the prestige wine pairing (a classic pairing is also available). To start with I had a glass of vintage Pol Roger champagne (not included in the pairings) and three snacks/amuses were served together with two different kinds of freshly baked bread and accompanying butter. Snacks tasted good, and the bread was utterly delicious (and was generously refilled several times during the meal).    First the caviar dishes were served (two different caviar selections by the way): one with hazelnuts and caramelized cream - simple but great combination of nutty, creamy and salty flavours - and one with an oyster and ice cream made on cress, which was also ever so delicious with the cress ice cream working very well.    The caviar dishes were followed by two different fish servings: first lemon sole with a Noilly Prat sauce, then halibut with Japanese influences (otherwise the kitchen is quite classic French) including dashi and yuzu. Both dishes looked and tasted wonderful.    Then came a vegetarian dish with the ripest tomatoes, I have ever tasted, basil and other herbs, and with a horse radish ""snow"" on top. Horse radish is rather strong and can easily ruin a dish, however in this case the use of the radish was restrained, so the dish was refreshing and worked very well.    Lobster and raspberry was next. I will never complain about lobster, and I understand the purpose of the raspberries was to cut through the rich flavours of the other ingredients, however I am not quite sure about this, probably just due to personal preferences.    A very rich dish followed: an onion soup with mushroom jelly and truffle. Lots of wonderful and earthy flavours. The pairing with a classic Morey St Denis red wine from Burgundy was stunning! The final savoury course was quail, I believe slightly barbecued, with chanterelles - again ""spot on"".    Dishes are quite small and when asked if I wanted a bit of cheese before desserts I accepted. There is no cheese board, but the waiter asked what I preferred and brought a selection of three rather generous pieces with a new type of freshly baked bread.    Then followed a palate cleanser/pre-dessert and the final dessert served in three parts including green tea, white currant, lemon, vanilla, and peas! I always find it a bit strange to include ingredients from the savoury kitchen in desserts, however the peas basically added texture. The dessert was both sweet and refreshing and a very delicious finishing to the meal.    With the coffee two additional sweets were served. The coffee (espresso) was very good - often top restaurants disappoint when serving espresso being too bitter, but Søllerød Kro's version was exactly as it should be: strong and not bitter.    The wine selection was quite classic, mostly from France, but also Germany and Hungary (Tokaji with the dessert) were represented. No modern wines go into the prestige wine pairing, which was amazing, and every pairing was perfect with the food.    When choosing the prestige tasting menu, the prestige wine pairing, top Champagne to start as well as additional cheese course (and wine) of course it comes with a price tag, approx. 800 EUR, which is quite a lot of money. However it is not expensive when you consider all the luxury ingredients, the perfect cooking, and not least the wine pairing, which - in this quality - is considerably more expensive in other restaurants. I believe that Søllerød Kro is indeed a highlight in the culinary world, and it would be great to see the restaurant having a well deserved second (or even a third) Michelin star."

Soelleroed Kro,50,My best Dinner ever....,"We revisited this fantastic restaurant,as my husband gave me a dinner incl everything as a birthdaypresent..Though been there severel times before, this evening became my best eating out experience ever.,Had 1 gl of champagne with the amuse bouche and then it all started...We chose the 9 meals menu with the winepairing..What luck...Fantastic wines, that tasted soo good, compared with the menu..which was ex, to courses with 2 kinds of caviar, then cod, halibut, and a broth which was wS served as a gelly with mushroms inside, and the waiters came with the hot soup and poured it over, and you now eated it as a soup..another dish with filled speciel mushroms, 2 more dishes with lots of black truffles, and another dish with dove in pastry, so tender and tastefull, and finally a dessert based on hazelnuts, served with a beautifull Sauterne. FINALLY coffie of your choice...This restaurant is not cheap, but worth every d.kr hou spend. No cirkus show off at the table, but only good tasting food, where the french inspired food is mainly based on taste, taste, taste rather than looking, even though it is served still mllking so beautifull and delicious. The evening we made our table reservation, later it was told on tv, that thd chef won the bouche d'or competition, so he is now "" the greatest chef in the world...  I am already saving up to go there again. And me and my husband has been 'high"" since this night 2 days ago....what an experience in the culinaric world...."

Soelleroed Kro,50,"A place for fine dining, and to return to",This restaurant has a very good reputation for fine dining. I have had a visit on my agenda for many years. My visit was a great experience with fine dining in good atmosphere in well kept locality. Easy reachable from Copenhagen about 40 minutes with public transportation. With Copenhagen Card the transportation is free. My verdict. It exceeded my expectations. Note it has Michelin star

Soelleroed Kro,50,Always such a pleasure,We have been a few times and this place is just so good. In my humble opinion one of the best in Denmark. I will for sure come back. I consider moving closer just to come by more often.

Soelleroed Kro,40,Very good but not Wow,"We went there for my wife's birthday and sat outside on a nice day. Apart from a party inside only three tables were occupied (one by an American restaurant critic who seemed to focus the attention of the staff). The service was excellent and very attentive. The waiter suggested a white wine which my wife didn't particularly like, so he brought another, no problem. We went for the lunch of three courses.  I thought that the food was very good, but perhaps not WOW. We were given the usual little 'mises en bouche' which were amusing and tasty. Probably expected something historic, but got a competent lunch. We had eaten at Dragsholm Slot (brasserie) a few months before and I thought that it was a notch above. Glad to have been there. Probably wouldn't go again."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Wr loved it and more 🥰,I went there with my wife. No expectation but man this was something out of this world. It expensive but for us it was worth every krona. Fabulous service and everything 100%

Soelleroed Kro,50,The annual Trimbach event.,"The annual Trimbach event was this time lunch instead of dinner, which did not make the experience any less. It was an exquisite experience where the delicious wines were paired with the restaurant's excellent understanding of delicious dishes, where food and wine went up in a higher unit."

Soelleroed Kro,50,We had to celebrate a member,"We had to celebrate a member of our winegroup.    We went to Søllerød Kro as so many times before. A priori the big question was of course could they rise to the same level as before the Corona lock down.    Yes. Of course. Søllerød Kro is the place to go in Copenhagen if you are in to the french cuisine at the highest level.    I can asure you, I will go there again.    NB: we had the finest selection of Bordeaux 1998 and 1990, and they are drinking perfect."

Soelleroed Kro,50,very good experience,"foods was high quality, staffs were friendly and knowledgeable not only about the foods but also about chef and the restaurant history. I had a good time there and will come back again. Totally worth the trip from Copenhagen."

Soelleroed Kro,40,A classic fine-dining experience,"Søllerød Kro has been a fixture of Copenhagen fine dining for decades, and it's easy to see why. It's located in a beautiful old coaching inn in one of Copenhagen's quiet leafy outer suburbs. It's hard to think of a more relaxing setting. It's also been a firm favourite of ours for years, when we want to splash out a little.    In addition to the setting, the food is reliably very good and occasionally sublime, and Søllerød Kro has a substantial wine menu. The staff are knowledgeable and approachable, but in keeping with the setting, tend to be slightly formal, rather than chatty. The style of food can be best described as French haute cuisine filtered through a Nordic lens - in other words, local ingredients or favourites, but given a delicate workup.    The only downside is that Søllerød Kro is well out of the city: if you plan to drink, plan also for a longish taxi ride, or a taxi from the train station at Holte."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Excellent food in delightful surroundings,We visited Copenhagen for the Christmas markets and we booked lunch at Sollerod Kro. It is on the outskirts of Copenhagen in a beautiful village and we were lucky with the weather and were able to walk from the station to the restaurant. We had a wonderful lunch. The food was exquisite! Matching wine was also excellent. Service was warm and attentive. A delightful experience!

Soelleroed Kro,40,Luxerious restaurant faraway from the centre,"We went for an romantic adventure dinner and for a fiest of tasting and good food. In short the restaurant lives up to his standards, specific taste experience, top service and relaxed atmosphere. Foie gras as a starter and beef as the main for me and the wife had the small lobster and the young duck, with this we had the 2016 Chateauneuf du pape exelent red wine. Top dishes, great tasting and served with care. French kitchen at it best. And the bill, yes that was a treat as well just over 4000 dkr not counting the 1000 dkr for taxis to and from the restaurant. A very expensive treat compared to Mcdonalds but worth every penny."

Soelleroed Kro,50,It was by far the best fine dining experience,"It was by far the best fine dining experience I have ever had, we were a group of 8 and the quality of service, timing , synchronization between all staff was mind blowing. It is a must come back place."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Absolutely wonderful,"Simply outstanding. Wonderful, warm and cozy restaurant with Michelin star in the most “down to earth” possible way.  Had the 7 course menu with wine paring, so delightful.  We wanted to change one of the wines, no problem at all and the replacement was perfect. One dish was a bit to salty for my taste, no problem, the waiter took care of it.  Can’t wait to return, just loved it."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Absolutely brilliant,"We spent our Anniversary this time Copenhagen and selected Sölleröd as the place the have the Anniversary dinner. We did have very high expectations (Michelin star, excelent ratings and rewievs), but Sölleröd even exceeded the expectations. Food, wine, service and ambience were absolutely great. We did have the seven course tasting menu and every single plate was superb and was real food - not just tasty tricks (the risk that always is when having tasting menu).  The location is little bit ""remote"" about 30 min from railwaystation by taxi, but in the other hand very beatiful and the surroudings is a part of the ambience.  To conclude: We have been quite many fine-dining restaurants allover Europe and the US. Sölleröd Kro is one of the best - I guess among the top three."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Delicious food and great service!,"Beautiful environment, delicious food and great service. Not to miss if you are around Copenhagen! A feast!"

Soelleroed Kro,50,Phenomenal in Every Way,"I went here for lunch as a splurge after a week-long conference (and a week of conference food). Yes, it is a bit out-of-the-way, but even for me, using public transit, it was only about an hour trip (from Frederiksberg) and a very easy one at that.    When you approach, it looks like a country inn that has had houses grow in around it (I think that may be the case). From the moment I arrived, I was treated extremely well. A variety of canapes (or ""snacks"") as they were described. A chance to order -- with the waiter not at all steering away from the cheaper lunch special menu, though I decided to go for the full 9-course tasting experience. One course after another served elegantly (almost all had a sauce to finish it at the table), and delightfully tasty, well-presented, and amply portioned. Add to that attentive drink refills, bread refills (and two excellent butters). Basically a top-tier dining experience that makes it no surprise this place has a Michelin star.    For those considering here, I would caution that the courses are a bit ""complex"" -- they tend to blend several ingredients, flavors, and textures. If you appreciate that, you'll be in heaven. If you're more of a meat and potatoes person, this might not be worth it for you."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Amazing Lunch,"Went with friends to the charming Søllerød Kro ..A characterful 17C thatched inn by a pond in a picturesque village, with a delightful courtyard terrace and three elegant, intimate rooms. We sat inside in their very posh and lovely decorated restaurant for lunch....what a service..with extremely friendly staff and servers, that made us feel very welcome and special...  The food was to die for...so elegantly prepared and presented...it is not cheap.....but worth every penny...no wonder they had received a MICHELIN One Star • for High quality cooking.....  Thank you for a very enjoyable visit......We shall be back..."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Incredible dining experience at Sollerod Kro,"My wife and I enjoyed an incredible dining experience at Sollerod Kro. We selected the restaurant because of it’s Michelin rating, so had high expectations. They were exceeded in every way including food quality, ambience, and service. We selected the tasting menu and it was sensational."

Soelleroed Kro,40,Solid as a rock,"Busy place, so remember to reserve a table. Historic buildings 20 mins. outside Copenhagen. Well composed 4 course dinner incl. wines. Waiters observant and polite."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Excellent,"I really liked the beef here, it was fantastic. Service was on par and the atmosphere was amazing. Looking forward for our next visit"

Soelleroed Kro,40,Interesting concepts,"Nice place with really good staff. Food was really great, especially the way they treated vegetables. Price was also very good, and the wine pairing had been well thought through. Nice desert as well. Will be back."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Always the best,"A visit to Søllerød Kro is such a classic and well-orchestrated although yet relaxed experience. Situated in the most beautiful surroundings imaginable the restaurant serves amazing food, service is the very best you can get anywhere, wines are fantastic. It's just something very special."

Soelleroed Kro,50,A place you just want to come back to,"The food at Sollerod Kro is always very very good and so is the wine and so is the service and so is the atmosphere and the total experience. Sollerod is one of these places that you just want to come back to, where you are always certain to get an amazing experience. There are very few places that consistently can reach this level."

Soelleroed Kro,50,"Once again - the dinner perfectly suited the excellent wines from Trimbach, ALsace","The seven dishes that the dinner consisted of on this special evening - the annual Trimbach evening - harmonized in the finest style the accompanying wines.  The atmosphere was top notch, serving discreet and friendly, the restaurant's style and atmosphere in a class of its own.  Incomprehensible that Søllerød Kro only has a Michelin star - they deserve at least one more!"

Soelleroed Kro,50,Excellent ‼️,"Together with a group of business associates I had dinner here last week. The old inn is a little bit warn inside but you forget it instantly when you are seated with the menu which is full of super exiting menu suggestions and al’a carte dishes.    I had three dishes  @ Scallops in browned butter and hazelnuts  @ Beef, beetroot, black currant, smoked marrow, roses & Caviar  @ Selection of European cheeses    ... and additionally a wide range of miniature ‘snacks’ to start with and small cakes/ chocolates for the coffee.    All in all we had an fantastic evening in Søllerød Kro, with excellent food and exquisite wines and superb service from a group of very knowledgeable waiters.    Had it not been for the head waiter who was suffering from a serious cold and struggling while presenting the dishes, it would have been a perfect evening."

Soelleroed Kro,50,One of Denmarks best restaurants,"I have visited Søllerød Kro many times over the years, so many that I will no longer review it in Børsen newspaper, where I am food critic. It is one of my absolute favourrites combining classic french gastronomy with a modest modern influence. Service may be the best in Denmark, is absolutely in the top 3, and the ambience is hyggelig."

Soelleroed Kro,50,A must try restaurant,"The compositions of food and wine is definitly in a class of its own - elegant, delicious, and every course was signature of Jan, the Chef. The dedication of the staff was also in a class of its own."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Wonderful Søllerød,"Søllerød was chosen best restaurant in Drnmark by Spiseguiden in 2018. And this is the place to go for culinary delights! Go for a set menu, there are several available, from a couple of plates to 8 plus. Service is absolutely excellent, headed by rest manager Jan Restorff who is a true star, making everyone feel welcome as a VIP. Sommelier and servants are excellent too. Food is to die for. Perfect place for celebrations!"

Soelleroed Kro,50,Wow!!,"everything about this place is soo nice and a wonderful stay and the food is in high quality. Prob one of my favorite places, I have been to recently!"

Soelleroed Kro,50,Fantastic - Well deserved M star,"Wonderful from start. Nice welcome, good seating. Good ambiance and akustic offering easy cross table convesertions. We dinned a la carte and enjoyed both meat and fish. The service is well balanced. Attention without constant disturbance. Great information and selektion of good wines. The food...More"

Soelleroed Kro,50,Amazing!,"We have visited a couple of times this past year, also with friends, and the food always surpass expectations! The wine list is simply outstanding, and Jan is always there with great recommendations!"

Soelleroed Kro,50,The Friendliest Michelin Star Restaurant Around,"The food is of the highest quality and the village setting is lovely. But what really sets this place apart from the rest is the sheer friendliness of the staff. The sommelier is not only knowledgeable, he also revels in finding just the right wines...More"

Soelleroed Kro,50,2 Michelin Star standard,"One of our favourite activities is to check out Michelin star restaurant. In DK we had visited more than a dozen over the years from Geranium, Noma to Kadeau and more. Sollerod Kro is definitely one that we would recommend. As expected the methods of...More"

Soelleroed Kro,50,Astonishing 6 courses!,Marvelous evening dining 6 courses with gourmet flavors out of this world! It will cost you but what did you expect? It’s one of the best restaurants in the city!

Soelleroed Kro,50,awesome,"after our biketour from kopenhagen, we ""earned"" an awesome lunch. worth the taff journey all the way"

Soelleroed Kro,50,A tasting menu to remember!,"Great meal, and a tasting menu to remember. Sollerod amuse-bouche were the ambiance and the surroundings was exceptional, very warm service. Prices are a bit high but worth it."

Soelleroed Kro,50,Heavenly dinning in a class by itself,"Fantastic evening - Trimbach dinner - the delicious dishes were accompanied by great Alsace wines from Trimbach. Great service, friendly atmosphere. Søllerød kro has one Michelin star - they really deserve more!"

Alchemist,50,One word: YES!,"It’s incredible and words can’t really do it justice. The food is great, the service is perfect and the whole experience is unforgettable."

Alchemist,50,check it out yourself.,"Beautiful crazy experience that will leave you baffled. Crazy combination. Food ia great obviously, but it's the experience that leaves you with a strangely beautiful aftertaste"

Alchemist,50,A unforgettable evening,"In addition to the food and the experience being incredible, the atmosphere is enjoyable, service is very good and the staff very friendly! We’ll be back!"

Alchemist,50,Worlds best restaurant,Perhaps the best restaurant in the world. This is not only about absolute world class food but also about a statement and an emotional tour through the different rooms in Alchemist.

Alchemist,50,Mind blowing,An experience extraordinary. And in every way. Of course the food is very special but so is everything else. If you are into this kind of gastronomy it’s a must try.

Alchemist,50,Best restaurant of the world,"The experience is balanced for everyone. The message that Rasmus wanna share is so strong, no one can describe it cuz you have to feel it."

Alchemist,50,Worth it,"This place is ridiculous because of the experience and how they pair the food with the wine and the graphics in the dome and the sound. I’ve definitely had better tasting food, but never in this context. Highly recommended."

Alchemist,50,Worth it,Beautiful experience. Attentive staff who can predict your needs. 50 small experiences. Definitely worth it.

Alchemist,50,The world's best Restaurant,"Even in its early days one of the most ambitious Restaurants ever created I've probably told my 2017 Alchemist story a hundred times and I'll probably tell it at least as many more - a showing of hospitality quite like any other. Already impressed by my visit to Chef Rasmus Munk’s original Restaurant it was an absolute privilege to sit down in the new concept and experience what is truly ""an experience"" - visual, aural, gastronomy, sociology, ecology, technology and even anthropology.    From the immense door to an opening “Impression” featuring a solo violinist playing “Vi sålde våra hemman” every aspect of Alchemist is intended to overwhelm the senses, and across five “Acts” in an equal number of hours Rasmus’ team never ceases to impress in catering to each guest’s every need.    Pointless to describe course-for-course, the journey occurring as guests move from room to room and idea to idea, early bites take place in front of a test kitchen where Champagne finds itself matched to Candy Floss Dumplings and “The Perfect Omelet” before traversing the 90,000 bottle Wine cellar to a planetarium called The Dome.    Often using Food as a vehicle, the overhead projection of polluted oceans coming to life with a jaw-dropping dish of Cod topped in crispy translucent Bouillon, consider also the idea of food waste in the form of Brain, Lung or Flesh from a Crab beyond the Legs.    Never lacking for technique, cryo-freezing and emulsification joining forces with ideas such as growing Mycelium on agar or dry-aging game in wax, custom service-ware makes many dishes more titillating including Orwell’s “1984” Eye or the silicon Tongue Kiss.    Gazed down upon by caged Birds while eating a deboned Thigh titled “Burnout Chicken,” shortly after lights went dark for “Cheers” featuring edible Bioluminescence that has generated a scientific paper, sweets begin with Force of Nature featuring Colostrum, Unpasteurized Honey and Formic Acid before picturesque “Andy Warhol” and Pig’s Blood Ganache complete with a QR Code to become a Blood Donor.    Making a statement about the abusive nature of child labor with “Guilty Pleasure” before guests enter the Pink Room, an impression best left as a surprise, it is after visiting another kitchen that guests end up in the Balcony with their thoughts and three more bites including Ants in “Amber” and a 3D Printed Tarte Tatin.    About those thoughts? Calling Alchemist the most forward thinking restaurant in the world right now is easy. But it's more than that. It is science and culture and art and 100+ people working together to create something extraordinary. It succeeds in its vision. It publishes scientific papers. It shows that big dreams can come true and that those dreams, even using Food as a medium, can make a difference."

Alchemist,20,"Ça c’est ne pas un restaurant deux étoiles, pas du tout!","We went to the restaurant expecting something sensational, but we were very disappointed. We had booked the super expensive ""sommelier table"" and had excepted something exceptional. When entering we were served a champagne that was completely flat, probably from whatever was left from last night or perhaps the night before that. Then the expensive wine pairing did not seem expensive at all, perhaps because we had a booking just before they closed before the summer holidays and did not want to open any expensive wines just for us or simply because it is never anything special - we do not know but we did not get any discount in the end so it is probably the standard cheap wines you will get. The dishes looked great, but without any interesting taste, just very bland. We do not like to lick on a plastic tongue that thousands of previous guests have licked on before us, especially when it was tasteless. When it came to service it is annoying to hear about ""sustainability"" and ""holistic"" when almost every dish was presented, just very annoying. If they really want to be holistic and sustainable they should probably close the restaurant. The head chef, Rasmus Munk was pleasant when he presented one or two dishes of the dishes, but the rest of the time we were left an American women who over and over again became aggressive when we asked something about the food. No, this is not by any means a two star restaurant. Michelin you have to reevaluate this: Alchemist is nowhere near Noma or Geranium or AOC."

Alchemist,40,Almost totally immersive,"Alchemist delivers impressions that lasts. Political and environmental alike the restaurant has something to say. With careful attention to detail Alchemist impresses dish (impression) after impression, room after room, with great variety and care. The dome is an amazing dining partner, mood setter and commentator. The staff was kind, attentive and acted with great precision and care.    The experience was almost immersive but for the first part. A weird feeling of awkward uncertainty presented itself when the waiter asked us if we wanted to start with a cocktail. Yes it sounds horrendous, but bear with me:    In an experience as curated and well thought of as this, I’d prefer Alchemist to design the experience on my behalf and skip this seemingly unnecessary step, perhaps bring a card with suggestions that will amplify the first impressions’ taste instead of competing with them. Not all cocktails fitted the first otherwise impressive impressions, and we felt awkward making decisions we didn’t know the scope of. If I’d known the cocktail would interfere with the tastes of the first five or so impressions, I would have chosen plain water and enjoyed the incredible creations coming from the kitchen."

Alchemist,50,A cultural experience,"First time here and what a pleasant surprise. After you get the through the huge front door, the experience start with around 50 ""experiences"".  There was live performance, food and visual impressions, that made the evening an interesting experience. It is hard to tell in a few words, it must be tried.    A unique holistic experience.    Food, service, location - everything was an experience."

Aloe,50,Very good and a little different dining experience,"Location is a bit extraordinary in the middle of local housing suburb. It’s a kind of Martin Berasategui. Aloe building doesn’t look much outside but it’s very nice inside.  First you have an aperitif with amuse bouche (5 pcs) in the lobby, and select the drink for a meal. Wine pairing is available along with extensive wine menu.  One fixed menu of 7 courses. Everything was very good, although I didn’t find too many ”wau” elements. Service was relaxed, nice and professional.  Coffee and sweets are digested in the lobby again.  I liked the concept of lobby and dining hall very much. Wine pairing was perhaps the best ever. It fit the food perfectly. Location was nice too. Kitchen can do even better."

Aloe,50,A true gem in the Stockholm suburbs.,"Well, I might be slightly bias since I have visited this excellent restaurant several times a year since 2015.  But they have had a long and funny trip through a lot of concepts all the way to where they are now with two Michelin Stars. But it also sends the message that this place is truly worth coming back to, again and again...and again.  They change the menu quite frequently but always with bombastic flavors and a great sense of detail.  Staff always friendly and professional and the venue feels cozy.  The tasting menu is awesome! Flavors from all over the world in new ways, always innovative.  I can all but recommend this place. It is well worth the price and the trip out into the suburbs of Stockholm.  I will be back!"

Aloe,50,Brilliant!,"Totally enjoyed the whole experience - and it is just that - a culinary and wine experience, so if you are simply look for dinner - don’t go. You need to be serious about food and serious about wine in equal measure. We totally loved the experience. End to end.  The food is incredibly well thought through and planned - and the wine stands as an essential part of each course - a vital component.  Every single member of the team knew, understood and could discuss the wine and food in detail and were able to answer any questions thrown at them.  We loved each course as it worked with the one before and after and how seamlessly it flowed. Simple elements were genius - the bread and butter for example.  Creative, ballsey and brave. Not to mention exquisite!  I’d urge any foodie to venture to the Resturant.  One note - the courses are slightly larger than expected, so don’t eat at all during the day before you go. We had to pass on the final ‘treats’ as we were simply too full.  It is expensive. It almost put us off before we booking. But it was worth it. Every single kronor.  Congratulations to the whole team."

Aloe,10,Mediocre experience. Had a better experience in one starred Michelin restaurant in Portugal,"Mediocre experience. Had a better experience in one starred Michelin restaurant in Portugal. 3 meals were ""wow"" while in Portugal 3 meals were okay and others were ""wow"". Presentation was subpar, plates looked like taken from my grandmother's house. Service was decent.    Expected more from two starred Michelin restaurant."

Aloe,50,Top of the line 2 star GM restaurant in the suburbs,"One of these chefs have been on a Swedish TV show with famous chefs competing against each other, which made us want to try his restaurant, and being one of the very few 2 star GM restaurant in Stockholm, it was worth a try. Have only tried one other 2 star; Mathias Dahlgren, in the city, and that was amazing, so this is also compared to that, and my level of a 2 star restaurant/dining experience.    First is that its out side of the city, in a suburb, so its a taxi ride there. When you get there, there is no way to know that this is Aloe. Above the entrace it says ""Living"", and we past it and looked around the house, before a girl asked if we were looking for Aloe, and we were not the only ones.  We were first seated in a small area before the restaurant section, which was devided, and no one told us why when we were seated, so it felt a bit strange. It took a little while before some one came and gave us a drink menu before the dinner, and I had to ask what was going on and why were sitting there. Got the explanation that this was the Hors d'auvre section, and we would have some starters and then go into the restaurant. Did not feel like a 2 start at this point.  We took a glas of non alcoholic tea sparkling, and here I noticed that the waiter did not dry the drops that he spilled on the table, which in my view is a miss take for this kind of restaurant.    To the food; We were told we would get 5 starters/Hors d'auvres first (see my pics). First was Red Curry, tomato, thai basil and coconutoil in a tea cup. Full of flavor and good. Second was much better, which was Foie Gras au Torchon with fig, cocoa and Ras el Hanout (a spice), which was delicious and it was also served with Otoro, with green juniper berry and trout roe that had been distilled in Sake. These nibbles were amazing. Then we got ""Lamb bread"" with a Bagna Cauda sauce, which was also very good, but hardly any lamb flavor, but dressing was amazing. Last was a version of a mozzarella, but in a glass; RAF tomato from spain with Creme Cru, Mariposa and Iranian basil. Very good.  All these packed with flavors, but the feeling overall was not a 2 start GM place and level of service.    Then we were guided into the restaurant section, with a more dark and cozy atmosphere. We were seated at an oval table with another couple, which I felt that we would rather have sat just the two of us, but there are no such tables.  Here the service was much better and up to standard. We sat close to the kitchen and could see the chefs preparing everything, which was nice.  First was a Langoustine Cru; Tartufo di Alba, black osteria caviar from Italy, aged vinegrette and noisette, and this dish with a LOAD of truffle was just marvelous. Amazing! Then we got Chawanmushi with Foie Gras, Cardemum and black caviar. Amazing as well. Third was grilled Char with Vin Jaune and XO sauce, which was also packed with flavor. Fourth was Rouget with Soup de Poisson and Beurre d'ail, so basically the green is butter and black is squid ink on a grilled bit of white fish Rouget with a sauce to it. Did was not anything special, but ok for a white fish. Fifth was Rein dear with grilled and smoked apple, black currant and Bagnoli truffle and this was amazing. So tender and so packed with flavor. Now we started to get into desserts and first got a Mango ice cream from Philibon with a topping that I do not remember, but was very good. Then my favourit of the evening; the Tipsy Cake. I have had it at Heston Blumenthals restaurant in London, and that is my standard, and this did not dissapoint. Tipsy cake with Cumquat, Rose leaf, Cumeopepar and Creme Cru. WOW!  Then we were moved back to the sitting area out side again for coffee and dessert. This time it felt better to sit there. They only had filetered coffee to offer, which was said was a light coffee, but packed with flavor. It was not. Quite flat. To that we were served a plate of ""Cristal"" Pineapple from Philibon, Itakuja chocolate that is double fermentation in passion fruit and Macaron; matcha japanese ginger and sea buckthorn. Second plate was Bahibe chocolate with tripple haselnuts from Piemonte, Raspberry marmelade with yuzu and peppar and Nyanbo chocolate ""After Eight"" with Bergamotte and green mint.  It was also a big black ""Lemon Noir"", which was a creme filling and white chocolate around that was done black, some how. This was delicious.    We did not have drink package to this serving, since I do not drink alcohol and my spouse cannot mix that many different alcohol types.    I would say that overall it was amazing flavors, but did not meet up to my overall expectations of a 2 star GM restaurant. Especially not the local and service level. I just commented on the first part of the evening with how we were seated and not told anything. Waitor not wiping of the table and the atmosphere and internal decoration in there. Food was very good, but compared to Mathias Dahlgren, this was a 1 star."

Aloe,50,Great experience outside the city,Great service and welcoming. Good food with nice wine pairings. The total experience was fantastic. Maybe the place lacks even higher quality ingredienses or a signature dish to take a next step. Otherwise there is nothing to complain.

Aloe,20,No cigar!,"The Ugly:    The layout of the place is horrible, you're sitted with other people you do not know in the same table and you do not face the person you go with, instead, all tables face a central waiter station...you spend your meal looking at the waiters instead the people you go with.....if it was the kitchen in the center I would understand the concept, to be able to see how your food is prepared and plated would be very nice, but I have zero interest in seeing napkins getting folded. Zero.    The Bad:    The menu lacked a solid progression, it kept going around in circles with no direction, not enough meat. The plating felt repetitive at times. Too much sweet, if I remember well we got a small pre dessert, first dessert and then second, followed by a lot of petite fours....it felt 1/3 of the meal was sweets.    The Good:    Technically the food was close to flawless, great sauces, solid purees, proteins cooked as it should, good textures, saltiness, balance, etc. Service was on spot almost all the time but once, when the water glass was empty for longer than it should have. Great wines and cocktails. Neat toilettes.    Veredict:    Menus come and go, and perhaps the one when I visited was not the best for me, I'm sure had I gone on another season I would probably have like it better. What I can't get over is the uncomfortable layout of the place, won't be going again because of that."

Aloe,50,Brave with wit and professionalism,"To eat at Aloë is to expose yourself. The concept is brave and bold. You are presented with food that mixes flavours you might not have put together in a million years.  Chinese “caviar” with coconut ice cream and a drizzle of olive oil.  Hm?  But - dare. Eat. Do.  You will not be disappointed. Chef, staff and food is perfectly balanced. Sommelier is avant-garde with a deep passion for the wineries that highlights craft over marketing. Serving staff is on point and the food...  The food! Shut up and eat."

Aloe,50,Absolutely THE best food in the world !,"I have been to many Michelin starred restaurants in the world including the (votes) best restaurant in the world (NOMA).    On arrival at ALOE, I thought I was sent to the wrong place by the taxi as the approach didn’t look like your typical Michelin starred restaurant. However we were brought to the actual restaurant behind another restaurant at the front called Living.    My expectations wasn’t high as my dining at Sushi Sho the night before was a real let down despite that restaurant being voted the best sushi restaurant in Sweden. Anyway that’s another story.    Aloe’s food was outstanding and the service was absolutely spot on. Very friendly staff who are knowledgeable, polite, professional and well deserving of a 3 Michelin starred level service let alone the 2 star they are rated at. The staff were friendly but maintained a level of professional distance unlike some places where they were over friendly to the point of being unprofessional.    The food can only be described as very creative, full of flavours that are full of depth and makes every single mouthful a wonder. I have never quite experienced every single serving to be so so brilliant and perfect. Most of the times when you dine at a michelin starred restaurant with a set menu you don’t always like everything or there’s something that’s too creative or strange. However at Aloe, every single course was a wonder and makes you just anticipate the next course so excitedly.    Perfect serving size and variety !    Aloe, you deserve 5 Michelin star if there ever was a 5 star rating. Your food is simply stunning and amazing and I vote you as the best restaurant in the world ! Thank you for this incredible culinary experience !"

Aloe,30,"Wouldn’t recommend, save your $$","All the pieces haven’t fallen into place for this setting to really pull it off.  We had the tasting menu with wine package.  The food was all right. Some dishes really really hit the spot of excitement but most of them was just all right. That’s not what you expect and maybe that’s why I’m giving this a 3 out of 5.  The staff wasn’t on point either. I believe that you should breath excitement of service when you work at a place like this, that wasn’t the case.  I guess it would’ve been a 4 or a 5 if the price was maybe half of it, but the price makes it less worth. Save your money a little longer and visit a ⭐️⭐️⭐️."

Aloe,50,"Well worth a visit, amazing food!","Was here with work, we had rented the restaurant for the night and I was very happy with the whole experience. The food was great, attentive staff and the surrounding cozy! It’s a bit outside the city center in the middle of a residential area, so you get about curious if you have arrived at the right destination, which makes it a good experience too. Well worth a visit!"

Aloe,30,"Good but the experience doesn't justify the price, nor the star","I visited with my wife first week of Sept and we had a good but not great dinner. It started of well with a drink in the orangerie, and then when we got seated the showed of some of the ingredients for the dinner. But after that it was all a bit bland. I had the wine paring but the wines never really complimented the food in the way I have experienced before at Michelin star restaurants. The dishes themselves where also either of a taste that I particularly don't like, or the dish simply doesn't work. I stopped taking photos about 1/3 in to the dinner once I knew that this won't be anything special. That the waitress took my wife's napkin when she went to the bathroom and never gave here a new one, or that I got a glas dropped in the head by the head waiter was not directly improving the overall experience. Very quiet in the middle of the week, just 3 couples in total. Maybe I should have come sometime when there was more meat on the menu, but the 4 seafood dishes was far to much for me. Only one meat dish, and that was duck. To much seafood also brought to much white wines. I am frankly disappointed. Dinner was 7000 sek for 2, one wine package and one non alcoholic package which by the way was probably the best of the whole evening."

Aloe,40,"Complex, tasty menu","The last day of May 2019 four of us experienced an explosion of very tasty dishes  sitting for a few hours in front of the kitchen at the recently reopened restaurant  Aloë (Stockholm).  The tasting menu “Spring” consisted mainly of seafood prepared with mainly oriental ingredients.  The monkfish and the lamb were (for 2 of us) slightly overcooked.  The pike-perch with kimchi was a bit too hot for most of us but all the other dishes were perfectly  cooked and the service competent and helpful.  The non-alcoholic pairing (1 guest) was excellent.  Aloë is a great restaurant, particularly for people who love strong, complex, deep savors."

Aloe,50,"Unusual first impression, but a wonderful experience once you're past the entrace","As others have noted, the restaurant is in a residential area and the approach and entrance are a bit unusual and idiosyncratic as such. Once you confirm you are in the right place and are seated, however, everything is first class all the way. The service is impeccable; the setting is very comfortable -- only half a dozen tables and one seating, so in no way crowded or loud or rushed; and, most importantly, the food is outstanding. Each course is an imaginative combination of flavors using the best of fresh ingredients and just wonderful. Not a miss the whole night. I enjoyed every bite of every course served (as well as the non-alcoholic drink pairings). Thanks to the chef and staff. It was a wonderful experience."

Aloe,40,Good restaurant with some things needing attention,"The restaurant itself is located in a spacious yet cozy house in a residential area in a suburb to Stockholm. The food was very good (4-4,5/5) with mainly a scandinavian/asian fusion theme, and is varied enough to keep you intrested. The non-alcoholic beverages were nicely matched to the food(4/5). Our favourite dishes were langoustine with grapefruit and pike- perch with kimchi (both pictured).  A few dishes, although not bad, did not match the same high standard as the rest. Also, the deserts did not impress (the yoghurt meringue was tasty however with room for improvement).  The service was ok (3,5/5) and attentive, however some fine tunement is needed. The main negative was that upon arrival we were left standing and waiting to be seated for 15 min, even though we were on time. And during that time we were served drinks that were added to the bill without informing us.  Exept for this inconvinience which we hope they will correct the overall experience was good, especially the food. Recommended."

Aloe,50,Best in Stockholm?,"Today this restaurant has one star in GM but they will probably have two stars very soon. Extremely competent staff, excellent food in a class of its own and a taste explosion in every dish. This restaurant is probably the best in Stockholm today. So get there! You will be thrilled."

Aloe,50,dinner time,"we were in the restaurant for a dinner last week! the place is really very nice, cozy and comfortable. staff is very profesional and friendly. food - of course is very good, interesting variations :) some dish was a little bit salty, but its just my opinion :)"

Aloe,50,Amazing food and fantastic service,One of the better restaurant experiences in Stockholm at the moment. This place does not have to be embarrassed when compared to other Michelin star restaurants in Stockholm. There is only one fixed menu and you choose what to drink. The place has recently added a sister restaurant in the basement that I have not tried but I am looking forward to that visit. A special plus to the service. Professional and at the same time very friendly. A must in Stockholm.

Aloe,50,Excellent!,"Fine Dining worth the effort to visit a small suburb outside Stockholm city. Excellent food and wine. The dinner takes time so plan to stay for 2-3 hours. Not very many tables, so make reservations way in advance. The premises doesn’t look much from the outside but is nicely equipped inside. Really an overwhelming eating experience. Expensive. Especially with the wine package. But worth every penny."

Aloe,30,"Bit much, really","I've been to quite a few Michelin star restaurants and I must say, to me, Aloë did not stand out among them. Service, interior, ambiance etc was very nice, and no less than expected. Wine pairings were good, even if I personally would have preferred one additional sample of red wine instead of two varieties of sweet wine. I can't *actually* fault the food either, so a three star review (even though it's a strong one) might seem a bit harsh, but let me explain: Apart from one of the dishes, which smelled like feet and tasted worse, all servings were *nice* - they just felt a little overly complicated and with just too much going on. Almost all servings consisted of a macaron-sized piece of protein in the middle, together with something crispy (deep fried potato, tapioca, puffed wheat etc), something pickled, something asian (yuzu, shiso etc), something typically Swedish, and something weird and/or exclusive. Around this, a liquid of somekind (a jus, a broth, a soup, melted butter...) was poured at the table. This matter of composition and presentation, I am sure, is ment to make all dishes stand for themeselves and be small works of art and utter completion. However, I found that it instead made them a bit too alike so that they became undistinguishable from eachother after a while. I also noted that some of the milder tasting elements, like the beautiful otoro tuna, got a bit overpowered. This made the meal as a whole, I hate to say it, a bit boring. Kind of like how fireworks are lovely but after a while you get a bit fatigued and start to long for candles. I understand that it may be a question of personal preference, but I think maybe the experience as a whole would have been more memorable if the individual dishes were a bit more clean and simple with fewer elements to them. All this said, I would still give the meal four stars if it wasn't for the fact that I felt quite sick for the whole night after. I don't have any food allergies, but I think that the accumulated ammount of fat, salt and sugar was the culprit, as I noted the content of all three of them was fairly high in many of the dishes. One could argue that everyone is responsible for their own food intake and that noone forced me to eat it all (which of course is all well and true). However, when you only have a set menu, and one that comes at a hefty price at that, I think you also need to take care not to overly stuff the customers and take into consideration that most diners would want to taste all the servings."

Aloe,50,World class!,A memory for life! We are foodies as well as wine nerds and have visited quite a number of restaurants. Aloë is an innovative fusion restaurant of world class. They also managed to pair excellent wines with the food.

Aloe,50,Amazing Restaurant,"This highly underrated restaurant was incredible on all levels - even when compared to top level dining in London, NYC, and Paris    Top level service    Top level food and presentation    The interior is upscale without being stuffy , and perfect for comfortable conversation.    Off the beaten trail slightly outside of Stockholm, but worth the cab ride from downtown ."

Aloe,50,Contemporary Romantic Gastronomy,"Just to say, two couples was here and got fantastic food and service. We had their 15 cause menu, plus four starters and three desserts. So even if every course is minimal, which is needed, all dshes is very attractive both in design and taste. All small receptive parts of your body is getting something to trigger enjoyment. There is a very nice environment, nearly as being at home with just a few tables. Staff is very serviceminded and attentative and knows the dishes very well. It may not be easy to ,get a table, and it is not cheap. I find it really good and the dinner took about 6h for the four of us."

Aloe,50,Visit Aloé for a excellent meal.,It doesn't look like much when you arrive. But this place will surprise you with a fantastic staff that gives you the best service. Then the food....wow....so well cook t with the right flavors and perfect mix of different kind of dishes. You wont regret a visit to this restaurant.

Aloe,50,In the burbs,"Well worth the 30 minute journey to Älvsjö from the center of Stockholm where Daniel Höglander and team serves the most inventive food in Stockholm at the moment. As Nordic base with great produce but with influences from Africa, India, China and Japan. If you have been to Tim Raue in Berlin, this is a similar concept but better executed."

Aloe,50,Fantastic perfection foods 👍🏻,"We went there for celebrated my father in law 60 years old birthday, the funny thing is we didn't order the foods, but up to the chefs, we suppose to get 11 dishes, but we got another 2 dishes special extra from the chefs, every dish were served with the different wine, all of it taste amazing, I mean another level beyond, can't compare with average restaurant on the street that we always ended for a fine dining, what I know the chefs got 1 star Michelin, but they suppose to get 3 stars in my opinion (used to eat at Gordon's restaurant that got 3 stars chef but really disappointed), the food was super super good, way too perfect, I can't find anything to complain, just take my money, so happy to pay for that foods without any regret."

Aloe,50,Wow!! Hidden gem!,"Followed up a successful meeting with a 6 course lunch of the highest possible standard. You enter a interior/ fashion store and go down one floor.    All courses was fanstastic in flavour, setup and presentation. Staff was very nice and the whole setup is with a personal and relaxed toch (you need to relax... a lunch takes approx 1,5h... but it is soooo worth it!)."

Aloe,50,"Cool, different and relaxed even though the ambition level is at the highest possible",Great dining experience if youre into experiencing what real gastro-nerds are able to create. Relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff and I wont even tell you about the food which is creative and cool. My december visit was minted by japanese influences but according to the staff this changes continuosly.

Aloe,50,Fantastic journey of flavours,what a great night absalutly spolied my senses with such amazing food plate after plate just full with favours... ps i love that u stay as far away from new nordic cusine as possible... keep up the great work guys and im sure that star is around the corner

Aloe,50,A hidden gem in Älvsjö,"It's all the small touches that make this place what it is, from the warm greeting when you arrive or the welcome at the table from the head chef to the amazing food. The dining room is like being in a lodge with a beautiful open kitchen. It's like being at home. Cozy and welcoming.  They had only one menu to choose from (tasting menu) which we accompanied with there selection of wines. The food is amazing well thought out and perfectly served. From start to finish we were delighted, with a killer finish of dessert.  As a side note I can say if your out after a meal that leaves you full then this may not be what your after. I left satisfied and savoring every detail of the evening not wanting for more. You won't leave hungry but you won't leave feeling like you've eaten too much!"

Aloe,50,One of the most memorable dishes of 2016,"Set in the lovely suburb of Stockholm.    8 course dinner, all lovely put together with great care and also stunning precision taste wise. The scallop, quickly seared, humongous in size in a salty broth, was the gem of the meal, and one of the best dishes I've had so far (we heard our neighbor say it as well).    Service - still has some to go. Although not bad, however it did not match the quality of the setting and also the food. everything went smooth, however the knowledge of the food, cooking techniques were surprisingly absent.    - Tip -  Try to get the bar seat and feel free to ask the head chef questions about the food and produces and also see the team work in the open kitchen."

Aloe,50,Magic food for foodlovers,"We enjoyed a 7meal-dinner but we celebrated our anniversary. You just sit down and then you get a lovely hoummousbread nice and warm served to you. Then it was a fantastic journey with 2 different types of saké, nice red and whit wine, delicious strangled pigeon, incredible fish dish, scallops, very attentive people serving us all evening. You sit in some kind of big living room in an ordinary suburb called Älvsjö and you have villas beside the restaurant and no other shops or restaurants. Amazing."

Aloe,50,Well worth the visit!,"Although a bit hard to find, when entering into the warm home-like atmosphere, Aloe already showed its good side. Cosy and nice. The reason to come here is of course the fine dining with excellent food & wine, all cooked to perfection with lots of cross-overs between Scandinavian, Asian, French and Italian tastes. We enjoyed the 7-course dinner with the wine/beverage package well paired. There were some extra starters and surprises as well, which brought the experience to an even higher level. Well worth the 200 EUR spent. Go there!"

Aloe,50,Amazing feast of taste,"We took the 7-course  It was a treat of flavors and combination that were a joy to taste,  a great personalized service and knowledge from the waiter that serve our dinner  I definitively recommend it, It was really fun to sat by the bar and see how every course from the Hors d'oeuvres to the coffee sweet cake, including the drinks to every course  Is not cheap but we really got value for our money,  Is not easy to get a table with short notice but is worth waiting"

Aloe,50,Super!,"Fine dining in a cosy atmosphere! Wonderful food, wine package increased the experience and the tast of the food!"

Aloe,50,The 7-course menu - Not cheap but well spent money for luxury eatingg,The 7-course menu - Not cheap but well spent money for luxury eating! SEK 995 but you can also have a 4-course meny at a lower price. we were SOOO pleased with the service and the meny. Unfortunately there were ony one selection of whiskey which made us a bit disappointed for a restaurant at this level. But I will definitely recommend this fine restaurant.

Aloe,50,Nothing short of excellent,"Every time I think of my visit to Aloë, I can't stop smiling. We had the seven-course tasting menu, which turned out to be eleven courses. Before the menu even started, the chefs came out with a couple of ""appetizers"", which set the tone immediately. Between the truffle covered scallop and the venison, they served a ginger sherbet and with our coffee, they threw in a brioche donut.    When you go here, you make two decisions. The first one is tricky. Four courses or seven. They don't cater for dietary needs (such as Atkins, etc.), but I'm sure they can omit ingredients if you have food allergies.    The next choice is easy. You will have to ask yourself if you are better than their sommelier at picking wine pairings. I'm not, so I went with the wine package, and what an interesting experience that was. The venison was accompanied by a white wine from Collio in Italy and worked perfectly. I would never have picked that wine with venison in a hundred years. A light Pinot Noir went well with the scallop.    I can not recommend this place highly enough. I would be surpised if this place does not get a Michelin star in the near future. Go out in the suburbs, and go the whole nine yards. If you like good food and wine, you will not be disappointed."

Aloe,50,Amazing,"Aloe is located in a suburb of Stockholm, as you arrive it feels like you are visiting an old friend.    The dining room is quite small and again very homely and the staff straight away makes you feel like at home.    We tried the 7 course meny which also comes with extra dishes, a lot of fantastic food!    Highlights were the smoked trout in a potato sauce and the deer with truffles.    Aloe is not cheap but the level of cooking exceeds the price tag.    I hope to comeback as soon as possible and recommend anyone to visit Aloe!!"

Aloe,50,food cooked to perfection,"the place is just amazing... situated in a residential area of Stockholm, away from the noise and the crowd, this place stands up for being elegant but not in a pretentious way. It is located on the back of a decoration store. The room, the furniture and the building are quite simple, but homy. As to the food, you can chose from a 7 or a 4 courses meal. We went for the 4 courses, but there were 8 small dishes, all cooked to perfection. The midcourses' dishes were surprisingly good, specially the blackcurrant and mint ice cream brought to the table before the last dish. I'd recommend this place a thousand times!!!"

Aloe,40,Sympathic outside town - and porno at WC! Take a cab now!,"Our friends has had dinner here a couple of times and they were thrilled about this restaurant that did not do tasting menu. Now they do... We had menu no7, seven dishes and, of course, appetizers. Some of the dishes were fabulous, some were mediocre and some were just boring. Please, don't serve ox's tail. You can't hide the taste even in foie gras and truffles. The wines had high quality, but they did not make the food sing. Since taste is individual and menus are changing, I won't write any more about the dining.    It is such a charming place! Chef Daniel Höglander came to welcome us; the ambiance is relaxing and the service is friendly. It was also interesting to be out in the suburbia. And, the surprise is the toilet with soft pornographic literature."

Aloe,50,The best meal ever!,"I got a birthday present from my wife: A dinner at Aloë's chef's table. We were there with our son on the opening night in May, had their 4 course menu and loved it. This time we went for the seven course menu, with wine pairings. Wow! This was the best meal we ever had. The photos are from May, I decided to let the camera rest this time.  Started with a glass of champaign and the first amuse: a small crêpe with fantastic topping. Then another delicious amuse (and a refill if champagne) and then the first starter, based on raw langoustine. After that, salted and smoked char, topped with caviar. Followed by walleye with chanterelles. Now time for the first main course: raw and tempered fillet of beef, with oysters and Kalix löjrom (bleak roe). Next, a ballotin made from foie gras and oxtail and then spicy corn-fed duck. for dessert baked chocolate, pistage, bergamott and caramel. Coffee and sweets. I do not hesitate to say that everything was perfect.  All paired with well selected and interesting wines from Sicily, Hungary, Spain, Madeira, California... We went straight to bed after the refreshing walk home.  The bill? About 190 Euro each. Lots of money for a dinner. And you have to eat the for or the seven course menu, so don't expect to pay less than 140 Euro with wine. But for this quality of food, wine and service, it's a steal! There is no way you can eat anything near this quality for this price, anywhere else in Scandinavia.  The place recently opened and I am sure it will be very hard to get a table, once the foodies have discovered it."

Bloom in the park,50,An all-around perfect dinner experience,"On the lakeside, in the middle of the park, its location already sells Bloom in the Park perfectly. From the outside the house is all dark and moody while in the inside is all sleek, ligjht colored and minimalist, absolutely gorgeous dinner setting.  Igi and his team make you feel welcome like you are arriving to a friend’s house. The menu items do not get an explanation at the table, only a QR code at the end of the meal reveals the menu. Naturally guests are being asked about allergies, intolerances etc and a vegetarian menu is also available.  The menu is always prepared from the freshest daily produce and in the autumn time it likely includes at least one piece of pumpkin. There is also no drink card but a good selection of wines may be paired to the meal but guests can also just order red wine if they so prefer.  Overall it was a wonderful experience which also comes reasonably priced. This is Michelin level without the stuffiness generally associated with it."

Bloom in the park,50,Great food served with special charm,"A log cabin in a beautiful park... and when you enter the restaurant, it will surprise you. The decoration is elegant with a definite Japanese touch and a surprisingly warm atmosphere. The food is fantastic, the service is impeccable and you are in for a lovely experience"

Bloom in the park,50,AMAZING staff,I had my wedding dinner here. After calling about 20 fine dining places and not one of them being able to satisfy even the most basic requests we had I finally called bloom. I could write an entire essay on everything that was amazing with this place but you go yourself and see. The best thing was the staff. The owner was welcoming and funny. They made the entire evening feel magical. I have never written a review before but I had to because of how amazing our experience was. Thank you Bloom!

Bloom in the park,50,Everything - and then some...,So much more than just a truly sumptuous dining experience! It is that - a wonderful cuisine with well picked accompanying wines - but it is also (despite the white walls) a warm experience with the most amazing host. To the many starred restaurants I have visited: go there and pick up what hosting is all about!

Bloom in the park,40,Unique experience for the eye and the palate,"It was over 12 years since we visited Bloom for the first time. Nothing has changed. Igi is still in full swing, the concept is still the same. No menu, no mentioning of what is on your plate or in your glass! It is your palate that should decide and detect what it is that you eat and drink! A true experience of taste and the eye.  Like the first time we were overwhelmed and recommend anybody to have and share this unique concept.  You enter the restaurant with not too many chairs and before you know the evening starts. A steady stream of nice dishes and drinks !!    Well done again Igi and team. We will not wait another 12 years to come back 🥸🥸"

Bloom in the park,50,"Nice food, great vibe","Omg the experience was beyond amazing!! The environment and the furnishing are sooo lovely, so is the food and the female server/chef we had. The other owner/chef was very rude and made us very ubcomfortable. He greeted us first, so I was frowning before we even sat down at the table so I totally agree with the other reviews here that he could ruin the whole experience. But our server later turned out to be this very nice, charismatic lady, both of us liked her a lot!! Again, I absolutely love the vibe, try to book the table beside the window if you can, it's truly lovely in the summer.  Since they let you guess the ingredients on the menu I'm not gonna comment too much on the food. But there could definitely be some improvements. In general we find the desserts a bit over shadowing the previous dishes, in both quality & quantity. Will travel to Malmo for this restaurant if ever in this region again."

Bloom in the park,10,It is incomprehensible that this restaurant is mentioned in the Michelin guide,"Not even in a street kitchen have I experienced such poor service. The food is ordinary and priced well above level. The owner behaves so rudely towards guests and staff that only a diagnosis can excuse this. Malmö offers so many lovely restaurants, so to others: avoid this trap."

Bloom in the park,10,Never eat there!,"LOUSY SERVICE!!! IF THIS IS THE LEVEL I WILL NEVER EAT THERE!!    Have contacted the restaurant by email, on Messenger and my wife even called them to understand if they are open during Midsummer. They’ve never responded to the written questions and they promised my wife to call back in 3 minutes…..which they of cause never did"

Bloom in the park,50,All time favorite!,"Been in this restaurant a few times and it is one of our all time favorites! Great atmosphere with a but of fun! Owner is politically very incorrect which we love, he us such a character! Great fresh food and menu is always a suprise!"

Bloom in the park,10,Pésimo,"Bad quality food from the Mellan market, Chinese’s shops and Lidl..  As a worker He didn’t paid and who been working without a contract I only can highly recommend to don’t go there to eat bad food and support the owner, IGI, well know in Malmö for his bad reputation… didn’t paying suppliers as well and many other issues that will be better to discuss in a court."

Bloom in the park,50,"Next to lake, nice quality dinner place.","Nice place. Go there relax, enjoy food. There is a parking place for restaurant, so no need to find a place. If weather is good, drink some stuff outside, next to lake maybe a cocktail before dinner. We went there for dinner. You never know what will be the menu, but while tasting, guess the ingredients. Nordic style, simple but nice quality. All the dishes are very tasty and nice. We like it. We came here with family and kids. They also like. Mostly 5-6 dishes. Mostly every 2 Month they change the menu. Nice wine menu. Good service, maybe not fast but good.  End of the food, if you are lucky enough than you can see the little Morris and the others."

Bloom in the park,50,Best restaurant in Europe!,"Me and my girlfriend went to Bloom yesterday (11th of August). Never been there before but we will go back for sure.    We came 30 min early, just entered to see if they had a bar to wait at or something like that. The owner (I think) saw us and came towards us, with the best energy. I told him that we were a bit early and he said that we came in perfect time, because the sun is going down.    He toke us to the behind of the restaurant, which is an amazing view. He then gave us two glas of bubble, that he had taken on the way out without us swing.  We had like 20 minutes of the most beautiful sunset with champagne.    Then it was time for food, but we were already amazed.  My girlfriend have great experience in food and restaurant service and I've eaten ""expensive food"" all around the world.    We had 3 dishes (+3 small dishes between the big ones) and both of us said ""oh my god"" ""f*ck this is so good"" etc. to every single dish!    So food and service was top dollar, 10/10 and highly recommended from both of us.  My girlfriend said that the service here was outstanding, they knew all the details of what to do and what not to do.    When it was time to pay, I felt like ""I don't care how much this will be. I think it costed around 2400kr, which is a lot of money, but I felt like ""Did we get all that, all the amazing food, amazing wines and the experience for only 2400 SEK!?"".    I've never had a better experience in Europe at a restaurant by far, that's why I'm confident to say that it's the best restaurant in Europe!!"

Bloom in the park,10,Good idea if you hate money and like tasteless food,"Nice atmosphere and friendly personnel. Unfortunately, that was the only positive experience from this restaurant. The food can be classified as very tasteless, no description of the food, and extremely overpriced. Wine package for 795sek included 3 glass of different no-name wines."

Bloom in the park,10,One of the worst restaurants in Malmö,"Horrible service, mediocre food.  The waiter was rude to us, didn´t even ask for our booking when we came inside, stood in the hallway literally staring at us.  Instead of presenting the dishes later mumbled ""We don´t blabla about food here"" :(  Tea and ice-cream were good, food per say - not disgusting, but not a Michelin-star restaurant experience."

Bloom in the park,10,Well this was disappointing.,"(Writing this in English to make sure the feedback can reach the staff.)  It's unethical / rude to assume that all customers have information about the concept, prices and menu before entering the restaurant. It's not a great first impression to not say anything about these things at all.  Unfortunately, the evening continued with service that can be described as non existent at best, rude at worst.  I ordered the vegan 5 course menu and my partner the standard one. In spite of having given more than 24 h notice about the vegan menu (which is what they mention on their website), it very much felt like I got what was left in the pantry - but it still cost as much as the standard menu. The most filling thing I was served was the ice cream for dessert, other than that it was a different vegetable for each dish (so I basically got a very expensive, deconstructed salad).  As we gave the feedback that the vegan menu didn't feel equivalent to the non-vegan one, the person we assumed to be the owner responded with being defensive rather than being apologetic or wanting to know more.    The only thing I appreciated about this evening was the comment at the top of the receipt: ""The Damage"". At least they got one thing right."

Bloom in the park,10,Owner with an aggressive attitude,"My wife booked a wedding anniversary dinner when we were back in her native Sweden. She took the time to ensure we reserved a window table for a view over the lake. All confirmed over email. When we were shown to our table it was the furthest from the window. On hearing her question the polite waiter, the owner marched up and became very defensive immediately. He told her we had a perfectly good view of the lake. She said that was fine but she had been expecting another table. The owner then told her that the guests at the table she thought she booked were there every month at that table. If she wanted to tell them to swap she could but he wasn’t going to. It was unnecessary and aggressive. It put a severe dent in the evening and when we got back to the Swedish family it was the feature of our conversation. He was a bully"

Bloom in the park,20,"Inconsistent, confused dining","This place recently lost its Michelin star, a demotion that clearly has shattered any illusions of - or allusions to - truly fine dining.    First off, the overly conceptual idea behind the tasting menu is fine at the starters, but curiosity quickly wears off and becomes an odd backwards way of having your courses served and then asking/reminding your server to talk you through the courses you just had but are already forgetting because - the flavors are not on point.    Best things in this five-course meal (which includes tiny ""middle courses"" that arrive to the middle of the table): the pre-starter tuna, the quite traditional mutton, the middle course buillon, the ""deconstructed"" final dessert. So, out of these eight or nine things to eat, barely half of them are worth mentioning.    Not to mention the odd, arrogant owner who stalked around in the room, making most people uncomfortable. As we approached our final course, suddenly the owner was the one placing out spoons for what we took to be the final course - not presenting or saying anything, he laid out a pallet cleanser course which we ate with our spoons. Later after having collected the dish he came back out with spoons AGAIN, passive-aggressively and I'm sure to him ""jokingly"" he admonished us for using the spoons which had been laid out right before the course arrived. He actually THREW A NAPKIN at my mother's head. Ridiculous and completely unaccpetable. Afterwards came the actual final course, a dessert bowl.    In conclusion: Uncommunicative and stumbling, with the flavors not backing up the pretentions. The wine package was though, in all fairness, very good - pricewise it gave us the best value."

Bloom in the park,40,Interesting concept,"Great atmosphere, relaxed and friendly. Interesting concept, you have to eat the food first and thereafter they will tell you what you eat. Some of the wines were a bit disappointing. Food was great."

Bloom in the park,50,Excellent venue and personal service,"We were lucky to get away for a few hours, and what better than to have lunch at Bloom in the Park. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the proprietor Iggy Vidal, who proudly led us throughout the three-course (++) meal. All courses are based on what was in season and tasted impeccable. Be sure to book in advance."

Bloom in the park,20,Disappointing,"The concept of not knowing what you are eating could be fun, however, it turns out to be quite annoying after you have been eating several dishes and realizing that the waiters don’t care about you. You are told that you will get a full explanation of what you have been eating but that never happens. In addition, you get a code to access the menu that you have experienced, however, checking the menu back home we could not recognize two of the dishes at all. It feels sad to say during this pandemic, but we can’t recommend this restaurant. For 3200 SEK you can definitely get much better."

Bloom in the park,50,Another great experience by Igi.,Excellent food w an elegant twist. Igi with team took care of us in their usual casual but knowledgeable way.

Bloom in the park,50,Always a treat!!,"Bloom In the Park has been a personal favourite for years, never disappointing. With covid-19 threat hanging all over us all, it was sad to see all the empty chairs. However, the spirit was still high, personal and attentive serving and chatting, delicious food and wine. What's not to love? It is wonderful to be surprised by new inventive dishes even when you think you've ""seen it all"". The view over the lake in the park is stunning and it is fun to watch people strolling/running by. It leaves me with the feeling that I have found that special, secret place, hidden in plain sight, if you only look."

Bloom in the park,10,I give 3 huge NO to this venue,I give 3 huge NO to this venue for its afternoon tea.  NO to food. Too little and not tasty. Trust me: you ll leave hungry!  NO to price. This simply doesn’t worth it. Not even close. 1 scone per person? Seriously? Not even enough butter for everyone.  NO to service. Original price for afternoon tea is 295. We were 12 people and we paid 400 each because restaurant decided to serve to us glass of champagne. We didn’t order that at all and were not warned but had to pay anyway. Not even mentioning that 105 kr for glass of a champagne is ridiculous price.  Pure disappointments.  This “afternoon tea “ has nothing to do with amazing offers in another countries.  Do not go there.

Bloom in the park,30,Dissapointing,"The restaurant has a rule, that they don't tell their guests what they are eating. A fun idea. However, what happens was, that the waiter just placed the plate in front of you and poured the wine and went away again. No interaction.    When we tried to talk with him after the dish, he just said that there would be time to discuss the menu later.    However, that did not happen and we were just given a card with a link and acode where we could see the menu. By then we had already forgotten the mediocre meal that we had.    There are so many other places to eat in Malmö, så chose somewhere else, where they are happy to discuss the food and tastes the kitchen spends so much time and effort to prepare."

Bloom in the park,50,Mind-blowingly good!,"My partner and I were seeing in the New Year in Copenhagen and, as we had a free day in our schedule there, we decided to hop across to Malmö, in Sweden (an easy 39-minute trip by train). We researched some restaurants catering for vegetarians, and Bloom In The Park came up. We were intrigued by the ""mystery"" dishes, and encouraged by the Michelin stars and the concept of not knowing (initially) what you're eating. With at least 24 hours' notice, they will serve vegetarian or vegan dishes, and of course will pay attention to any allergies.    As soon as we arrived through the main entrance, we were struck by the gorgeous smell of fresh tiger lilies in the entrance hall and were greeted by friendly staff who helped us with our coats and led us to our table for the evening. And then the fun began!    The staff check for allergies and dislikes before the meal begins, then you're off! We chose a six course option with wine pairings and it truly blew my mind. The food was outstandingly tasty, and it was a lot of fun trying to guess what was what - we frequently got it wrong! Sometimes, you'd think you knew what a dish consisted of on sight, only to taste it and find out it was something completely different. The wine-pairing was great too - I love a wine-paired meal! Don't worry, though - if you're not into that, you can simply choose a glass or a bottle of what you'd like to drink. The wine list is very good!    The Maître D' was warm and friendly, and we noticed him going to every table for a chat, as well as coming to ours, of course. You are told what the food is, if you ask, and there were some fantastic combinations of foods you would never have dreamed of. Above all, the food and drink was wonderful, the setting very comfortable, with lots of room and no tables too close together, and the service was warm, efficient and friendly. A must-try experience for a visit to Malmö."

Bloom in the park,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"This is a classy place!! We had a late seating and they didn’t even ask for our reservation when we arrived but simply seated us. The concept of not knowing the menu until after is brilliant. No one had their phones out but instead they talked to each other. The staff is knowledgable and professional, together with the head chef and the owner the handle the service flawlessly! As for the food it was one of the best meals of our life. Every flavour so precisely selected and added. The price is high but so worth it if you are a bit of a foodie!!"

Bloom in the park,50,"Unexpected, surprising and truly memorable","Bloom in the Park was my first Michelin star restaurant and it didn't disappoint. From the atmosphere, to the service, to the incredible food (not to mention the excellent wine pairings) dinner was an unforgettable experience. It was a quiet night, so the restaurant had a relaxed, calm vibe, accentuated by the friendly servers who were always available but not hovering. Be prepared for a culinary adventure as there's no menu and you're served a 3 or 5 course menu made from fresh, local products. There's no description of the food when it's served, leaving it to you to explore the meal and discuss the flavours with your dining companion. They do ask if there's anything you're allergic to, or don't like, so there should be no unpleasant surprises with your meal. Quality rules here, and every dish placed in front of us was evidence of the skill and passion of the kitchen. We were on a time limit and the kitchen worked well to give us the full ""Bloom"" experience in the time that we had. Leave your assumptions at the door and embrace the unique experience that is Boom On The Park."

Bloom in the park,50,Again and again...,"We have never been anything but very happy with what Bloom delivers.But tonight we think they even surpassed our very high expectations. From the very first appetizer to the very last dessert we were in heaven. We very much appreciated the umami-rich flavors of the Middle East so wonderfully well balanced with the Nordic ingredients, like the handpicked mushrooms from our nearby woods. And then - what a surprise - to get a quivering fresh little goose liver - just a small one, quite natural, from a bird that was never force-fed. My eyes filled with tears - it´s been years since I had goose-liver and I was so happy that I could have it again without feeling like a villain. I know it´s not going to happen again anytime soon but I´m counting my blessings!"

Bloom in the park,30,Nice atmosphere....but thats pretty much it!,"When my girlfriend and I arrived, we were met by a very energetic man (maybe the owner). He started to joke around with us which was fun. But in combination with this he hit me on the chest (with good intentions) but the blow was relatively hard.  This is what I think; If you do not know the person standing in front of you, you do not hit them on the arm or chest -or anywhere else for that matter.  My thoughts were immediate, what if I had just been operated on, have an injury or simply just a new tattoo on the body part where he strikes.  But again, I just want to state that his intentions were good. It was simply a bromance-slap that was not well thought out.    The food was good and exciting but as with other ""fine restaurants"" they do not combine quality with quantity. In other words, we had to go to McDondalds after eating the 5 course menu at the restaurant.    Something that also effects our rating on this restaurant is that we were charged 65 SEK (about $ 7) for the water which was clearly just tap water.    To summarize. We all feel different and what does not suit us certainly could be a great experience for somebody else. So do not let our comments affect your decision to try this restaurant. After all, it has a Michelin star!    However, we will probably not go there again in the near future."

Bloom in the park,20,"Pretentious, sterile and unprofessional restaurant","I booked this restaurant for my partner's birthday and it was a huge & costly disappointment. The place gives off an air of being extremely luxurious, and hence the prices. However the atmosphere is cold & sterile, we felt uncomfortable even talking to each other in a normal tone. You get asked if you want red or white wine. No option as to what type of wine they have, or what food you are going to eat. When you are served, there is no explanation to what’s on your plate (as is typical in fine-dining), which is bizarre. My partner didn’t get asked if they wanted fish or meat. I'm a passionate vegan & have eaten vegan all over the world, and this was merely mediocre and pretentious. They told us to guess the ingredient in the dessert & when we couldn't guess they kept saying “guess, guess“. We almost had to argue to find out what we had just eaten. The waiters come in and out so often it creates a hectic atmosphere. They constantly click this button which makes a loud noise. We had 4 different waiters & one of them kept dragging the palm of his hand on our table. Suddenly he moved all our things to another table. We had no idea what was going on until he told us to move table as it had a better view. When I asked to pay they told us we should stay for a while and just sit, but we just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. I felt like we were constantly being told what to do. It was the most uncomfortable dinning experience we've had and a huge disappointment."

Bloom in the park,40,Excellent food but service was below par,"The combinations, the visual treats, the textures...absolutely incredible. Along with the wine package an absolute must when in Malmoe. Have visited Bloom before and they maintain an overall excellent level.  However, at this particular occasion the staff was somewhat blasé to the point of almost being borderline rude. They served with very little enthusiasm and it almost felt like we intruded on their day off..?  Still - an awesome dinner worth every penny!"

Bloom in the park,50,Superb food and service.,"I was really impressed with the flavours and presentation of the three course set menu lunch we had at Bloom. I was part of a big group and we had booked this restaurant well in advance, because of its reputation and location. Given its Michelin star rating, my expectations were high, but were certainly met! The location beside a lake, in the park is special and I love the contemporary style fit out inside.  Highly recommended for a special occasion, or business gathering."

Bloom in the park,10,Very DISAPPOINTED !!,"17th of May, me & hubby was having my birthday dinner at Bloom.  We called our kids nanny before we went in and still have my phone on my hand.  We sat down and I was about to put the phone on the bag, it was on the table still.  1. A waitress with braided hair but put up came and she said harshly ""NO PHONE ON THE TABLE"".  2. First meal before the 5 menus is arrived, when we're done, the place for some stones were broken when a waiter, pretty tall guy with beird & mustache from Poland lifted it up, and he was joking about it but NO APOLOGIZING, so no, NO APOLOGIZE !  3. HAIR ON THE BREAD !!! Out of question !!! But the worse part is that when we told them, which another different person who serving the table, a Swedish bold guy, he responds was ""OJ, VILL NI HA NYTT"" means ""Ouch, Do you want new"" ... Again, NO APOLOGIZE what so ever !!!  4. Almost at the end of the dinner, me & hubby was curious about the people who works there. Because it felt like so uncoordinated, few people trying to serving one table and miscommunicated too.  Anyway, we asked the tall guy with beird & mustache (just to making conversation) ""Where are you from?"" ..  He answered arrogantly (with his swinging around his body) ""EUROPE"" !!!  We looked each other and ask again ""hhmm ok, but where in EUROPE? ..  He answered ""yeah everywhere in Europe"", took a while untill he explained that he was born in Poland and so on...    The point of all of this is, this place is absolutely OVERRATED for a Michelin restaurant.  The food was only ok, the service was absolutely hideous.  If this restaurant is not a Michelin star restaurant, then yeah sure, it's not very pleasant but it's a regular restaurant not a one star restaurant.    It was my WORSE BIRTHDAY dinner EVER !!!  And I was just wanna get the hell out of there soon as possible !!!!"

Bloom in the park,50,Nice evening,"We had five courses and they where all very good, its one of the best restaurants in Malmö and I can highly recomend this restaurant"

Bloom in the park,50,Truly excellent and innovative,"We are foodies, but usually prefer a cosy bistro to gourmet dining, The usual feeling as we leave these fine dining places is one of dissatisfaction. We have tried everything from Era Ora in Copenhagen to Frantzéns in Stockholm, and we were never exactly happy. The food is too strange, the staff talk too much, the prices are too steep and we are never even half full, in spite of having dined for hours. Now, after trying Bloom in the Park - a special tasting menu for my birthday - we where totally happy! There is no menu, everything is made up fresh everyday, and every part of the animal is used. The chef served us herself and we agreed to getting no information about the dishes. This proved to be a fantastic tasting, since we had to really concentrate all our senses to try and smell and taste and guess the ingredients. The starters were simply divine: subtle and exquisite variations of asparagus and butter and edible flowers - just beautiful, and the dessert was divine - ice cream and sides made of miso and sweet potatoes! An absolute treat and an unforgettable experience! Gourmet food should be like this - fun, surprising, light and beautiful, and above all: delicious."

Bloom in the park,10,Gloom in the Park,"I Am completely disgusted and disappointed    I had booked a table for tonite to celebrate my partners birthday    On arrival there was no one to greet us then eventually a member of staff came out of the kitchen , looked at us and said oh    He did not greet us , did not ask us if we had a reservation nothing    Just proceeded to leed us to a table    I said we had reserved response was no problem    Really do not think this character was even listening    When we kindly asked if we could have a window seat, which is kind of the point of the location to be able to enjoy the view of the park, we were met with an abrupt even when we said we had reserved    Never have we been met with such arrogance!    The nite before been to Vollmers where the service was both excellent and warm and then to be treated like rifraf to be shoved on to a corner almost like being next to the toilet type table We left! And went to Johan P instead    You could do well to learn from both of these restaurants and be mindful with social media that you can not and will not get away with treating PAYING customers in such a rude arogant way    Plus the shades were down in any case over the windows which  makes a nonsense of the location    Not Bloom  In the park more like    Gloom  In the park !!!!!!!"

Bloom in the park,40,75th birthday dinner,Had a great evening with really innovative dishes matching their one star Michelin. The owner entertained with stories about the dishes and the ingredients. They go to great lengths to get high quality local produce. The duck was the best I have ever tasted!

Bloom in the park,10,Terrible staff,Do not recommend at all. Ok food. Fun koncept. But the sommelier was really rude and ruined the whole experience. He seemed to think very high of himself and responded as such.

Bloom in the park,30,Boring afternoon tea,"No choice in tea. No introduction to the dishes. Cheeky waiter liked to talk, but didn't listen or read the guests. No cakes??? Really? Disappointment."

Bloom in the park,40,Entertaining Meal,"Food was excellent. The hilarious part was they do not tell you what the dish is until after you've eaten it, and so it became like a game for us. We had a humorous and knowledgeable waiter. The wine selection was also top notch."

Bloom in the park,50,"Bloom In The Park, Malmo 2018","I would rate BLOOM 6 stars if it was possible! However, if you are someone who wants or must pick your meal from a menu, or just need to know in advance what your meal is, stop here and look somewhere else. Bloom is not for you!    At Bloom the food is artfully prepared and presented and the wines are masterfully paired to the flavors of each course. When we arrived, we were greeted with a glass of champagne and directed to the deck overlooking the lake adjacent to the restaurant. We were asked about any food allergies the group might have and about any dietary issues there might be. In our group, one person is allergic to cows milk protein, and two do not like organ meats. With that said, it was the last time any menu item was discussed until after each course and then only in general terms. Two beautiful appetizers were brought out to the deck before we were seated in the dinning room. Once seated, each course was delivered with its matching wine pairing. It began with lighter fare and built to the main course and ended with dessert. Each course was appropriately sized for a multi-course meal, and ample time was provided between courses to allow for conversation and enjoyment of the food and wine. We were never rushed. The staff was great and offered explanations on the reasoning behind the wine selections after we finished each course.    Once the meal was over and as we waddled out, we were handed a business card with a CR code and number that we scanned and received a full explanation of everything we were served! All four of us loved the experience at Bloom. We highly recommend it and hope you enjoy it as much as we did!!! RB"

Bloom in the park,50,Great experience!,"We were a large group of seven, five adults and two children. They do not offer a children's menu, however they charge less for the children.  We enjoyed every part of it! We had the 5 course menu with the wine package. The food tasted fantasticand and we also found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. We had a great time, I can really recommend visiting Bloom in the park."

Bloom in the park,50,Wonderful experience that still works as a dinner,"I loved the concept of not knowing what you're eating and trying to guess, it was a lot of fun. It was also fun when the waiter then explained what everything was and maybe why we got things wrong.    I was a bit worried though, that the food wouldn't be good beyond the gimmick. I'm happy to say the food was delicious, creative and perhaps most impressively, it was very filling! They also managed food preferences well and had fast and very good service. It wasn't even that expensive given the quality, I'd recommend this to anyone!"

Bloom in the park,50,Big Time Lux,Have been here +10 times and glad to say the restaurant continues to evolve the food/drinks. Tasteful modern menu and surprisingly good wines - great to be spoiled again.

Bloom in the park,50,Amazing dinner in Malmo,"The service, food, wine and overall experience was top notch. In our top 10 lifetime meals. The food was delightful and the wine pairing exquisite. Staff would not reveal the wine or specifics of food until after the serving. They were easily able to accommodate my milk allergy. Thank you for a most memorable dining experience."

Geranium,50,Genius,"Having been slightly disappointed in Noma a couple of years ago I was eager to see what this restaurant was all about. Well it’s definitely unique. Based on the 8th floor of a complex which houses the national football stadium for a start.  Once you get out of the lift though you enter a very light and well considered room. Everything very, well, Skandi.  Calmness prevails but there is also a warmness about the place which is carried throughout by the excellent waiting staff.  So the menu itself is about twenty something small bite sized dishes. Obviously if you have an allergy or don’t like an ingredient they just substitute it. Very importantly it is a meat free menu. Now I must admit I hadn’t realised that and it may have impacted on whether I came.    I have to say the lack of meat didn’t reduce my enjoyment one bit. In fact I came away feeling nicely full and very satisfied.  That’s all down to the quality and innovation of the dishes.  Everything was just so immaculate, well constructed and beautifully presented.  It worked so well as a collective.  Now we had the basic wine pairing but there are 4 options as well as just by the glass/bottle.  Some excellent and interesting wines. I was a bit concerned when a Pinot noir appeared given no meat but it worked very well with the turbot.  Obviously it’s not for the faint hearted as far as emptying the wallet goes but it’s a wonderful and special experience.    I think at Noma we felt like part of somebody else’s experiment where as here we felt the experiment was done especially for us."

Geranium,50,YOLO Dining,"What is there to say about Geranium that hasn’t been said? If you’re on the fence about going, get off the fence and go. We had a marvelous experience all around.    The food is interesting, with things you wouldn’t think to eat combined in a way you wouldn’t expect. It is elevated but not inaccessible, especially once the dishes are explained. The service is warm and friendly. We never felt out of place or like we shouldn’t be there.    It was very cool to tour the wine cellar and kitchens between the savory and dessert courses. The energy in the front and back kitchens was collegial. It’s definitely a place that could feel competitive or high pressure. Instead, it felt like everyone genuinely wanted to be there and enjoyed it —not something to you get in every workplace.    Overall, if you’re into once in a lifetime experiences in a global city with outstanding cuisine, this should be your stop."

Geranium,50,Still wonderful,"Geranium is a beautiful restaurant with an incredible wine list, and a pleasant atmosphere that allows for an enjoyable conversation. The service is spotless. Geranium is one of the best restaurants in Denmark. I had the pleasure to dine at Geranium few years ago and it seems as if it didn't change much. Unlike most restaurants, I find Geranium unique in that it is suitable for different purposes, family gathering, friends get together or business dinner (as long as you don't mind a long dinner)."

Geranium,50,The perfect restaurant,When planning my trip to Denmark I decided to book in advance a table here after researching a few options in Copenhagen  Michelin Guide. The place didn't disappoint! Food was pretty laid back but extremely tasty - the chefs manage to give a special and unique touch to every single dish .

Geranium,50,Amazing!,"We were so lucky that our hotel managed to get us a reservation at this restaurant the week before we visited Copenhagen. It lived up to its reputation in terms of presentation, textures and flavours all with no meat which was a refreshing change for us. The service was fantastic by coincidence the Sommelier came from a neighbouring village in Oxfordshire. An unforgettable experience, although the cost is eye watering."

Geranium,50,Truly exceptional dinner with a few suggestions to make your experience even better,"This is a truly amazing experience. The food, the presentations and the people. Special big thanks to Jackie the wine expert who was not only a true expert but also a great, genuine and friendly person.  Although i did give 5 stars because the restaurant deserves it, here are a few points for improvement :  1. The espresso was truly undrinkable. Sorry. They make a whole fuss of it with hand-held machines at your table but the espresso is so sour that it is really undrinkable. Guys- for such an amazing place, do something about your coffee !  2. Be prepared for this exceptional dinner, it is not for everyone : ALL dishes are miniature size that you finish in two bites. This is not a problem with amount of food (-you will not get out hungry, there are enough ""bites"") but you will not be able to ""linger' on a main course or something more substantial. We did not mind so much but be aware.  3. The price is exceptionally high. Around 500 Euro's without drinks. I understand that this kind of dinner is expensive to make (not to mention the exceptional service and personnel) but judge for yourself if this worths the expense. Especially annoying is the pricing of their wines which is on the high side even comparing to other restaurants in Copenhagen. Be aware. Their non-alcoholic arrangement of exceptional juices is also extremely expensive at 250 Euro per person. Again- i am not saying it is overpriced because the amount of labor invested in it is amazing, but still- a lot of money..."

Geranium,50,Best Sommelier ever,"Fabulous restaurant, deserves all their accolades. Food was amazing but what made it a truly unique experience was the phenomenal wine list and the people who created and served it. Soren is of course the best but also - and especially- Jackie, who was incredibly knowledgeable and so generous. Jackie made our dinner so very special - thank you!!    (And to anyone who plans going there - don’t skimp on the wine, either do their pairings or try individual selections guided by the team)."

Geranium,50,Amazing Experience at the World’s Best Restaurant,"We had an unforgettable experience at Geranium, which fully deserves its title as the number one restaurant in the world. We planned our visit to Copenhagen three months in advance to secure a table, and we were not disappointed. The dishes served were not only beautiful and delicately prepared but tasted unique and delicious. The only dish that fell short of our expectations was the white piece Dark chocolate and Jerusalem artichoke dessert. However, all the other dishes exceeded our expectations in terms of flavor and texture. We also opted for the non-alcoholic package, which was outstanding. The juice flavors were delicious and perfectly complemented the meals. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, describing each meal in detail and making the experience even more enjoyable. As native Spanish speakers, it was great to have a Spanish chef explain some of the dishes and show us around the restaurant. Overall, our experience at Geranium was wonderful indeed, and we would love to revisit this place when they have a new menu."

Geranium,50,Each bite is an edible piece of art,"First, the (not so easy) logistics: Geranium is among the highest in-demand places in Copenhagen (along with Alchemist), and deservedly so... Booking a table here takes some perseverance, patience, and skill. The slots for a specific date open 3 months in advance, and you can reserve a table through their website.    Assuming you've managed to secure a spot, you will be rewarded. Every bite showing up on the table throughout the evening was art in an edible form, and the flavors were simply unmatched. The Geranium team somehow managed to amplify the natural beauty of each ingredient in a stunning presentation. So I am not at all surprised that they retained their 3 stars in the 2023 Michelin guide.    The team is super friendly and welcoming. At the same time, the service to me felt a little less polished compared to a few other places (the already mentioned Alchemist being my personal golden standard for a perfectly choreographed meal). Outside of that, it was a perfect night.    All in all, definitely worth it. This place would be a great choice for a special event, celebration, or a(n elevated) date night."

Geranium,50,I need 6 stars,"I got a plane a Friday morning for a business meeting up at Copenhagen. Geranium was the restaurant where we had the meeting while enjoying such a delightful, joyful menu. Flavours are reconstructed in a way that once you close your mouth, a cumulus of sensations start building what I call ""the miracle"".  If you have the opportunity to book, do not hesitate."

Geranium,40,Perfect delicious food,"So... why not 5/5? Because for a 3 Michelin restaurant I would have expected that the attention to detail towards food and service would also carry over to the staff's uniforms. Call me a stickler, but for a 3-star restaurant I would expect the uniforms to be impeccable. This was not so: One pair of pants was visibly worn around the buckle, one female staff member's outfit was dirty (clearly she sat down on something), one male staff member's jacket was dirty around the chest pocket, and one female staff member's outfit was poorly cut to a point where I wish the restaurant would accommodate folks from all backgrounds, genders and sizes. Having had my rant, now to the good part of the evening...    Food and wine were amazing. Every bite served (except for one that felt bland – see photos) was delicious. The attention to detail was astounding and the seasoning absolutely perfect. Most notable was the squid dish, although again, the meal was truly perfect. Wines were excellent, but of course came with the corresponding price point. Service was impeccable and the space simple, yet modern.    Overall it was a wonderful night. I wish I had had the chance to briefly meet the staff to thank them for the great experience. Will be back."

Geranium,50,Number 1 for a reason,"We went just before it became the number one restaurant in the world. It is beyond spectacular. The ingredients, the taste and textures, the flavours. Just incredible and totally worth the cost. It is an experience that you will not forget"

Geranium,50,Pure art and class,"After going the day before at Alchemist, it was time for a dive in pure artistic gastronomy and classy atmosphere. Each dish was a masterpiece, both in presentation and in terms of taste experience. Everything was perfect and the service is outstanding. A must go once in a lifetime for every gastronomic fan. It's worth doing the pairing with alcohol and non-alcohol at the same time, different and enjoyable experience"

Geranium,50,Very delicate works of art on your plate.,"Best ranked restaurant in the World at the moment. I don’t know if that is true, but for sure it is the Best Restaurant I attended in years (and we really are used to eat in toprestaurants). The dishes were not only exceptionally tasty, they also looked beautiful. Very delicate works of art on your plate. Surprising flavor combinations where each ingredient has its added value and where you distinguish all the flavours. In any of the 17 dishes you recognize delicate craftsmanship and pure flavors. We went for the newer wines and were pleasantly surprised time and again by a very good selection. The adjusted non-alcoholic package was also completely matched and delicious. The staff noticed everything, were always available, but most of all were also conversational and brought serenity. Almost 5 hours at the table and not bored for a second. Fantastic also that we got a tour behind the scenes: every staff member had a smile on their face. And that wasn't forced. Both in dining room, and kitchen, you just see passionate people who go the extra mile to give you the time of your life. Is it expensive? Yes sure it is. But worth every penny."

Geranium,40,Inventive Cuisine Experience with Some Ups and Downs,"Geranium is a restaurant in Copenhagen that is well known for its inventive cuisine and has three Michelin stars. My experience at the restaurant was mixed.    The appetizers and savoury dishes were impressive and outstanding, but unfortunately, the desserts were a bit disappointing. Among the savoury dishes, the ""Abstract of king crab"" and ""Tuber Melanosporum with cauliflower"" stood out. However, the Monkfish did not seem to fit in with the rest of the menu.    The sweet dishes were nice, but not as impressive as the savoury ones. The mignardises, in particular, were a bit of a letdown. Additionally, the amount of food served was on the lighter side.    The staff was not as welcoming as other Michelin-starred restaurants I've been to, such as Frantzen, Zen, or Jordnaer.    The wine cellar is impressive, but the prices are steep. So, if you're on a budget, it's best to be careful about the wine selection.    In summary, Geranium is a very good restaurant, but it did not live up to my expectations entirely. If you're in Copenhagen and looking for an innovative and inventive cuisine experience, it's worth trying to get a table Geranium. However, it may not be the best choice for those who are looking for a more welcoming and traditional Michelin-starred dining experience."

Geranium,50,Absolute splendour,"Wow! The most magnificent dining experience for my sons 21st birthday. The food was exceptional, wine list impeccable, service outstanding! The entire evening was splendid & they treated us like the only ones in the room. The 18 courses (caviar extra) of fish & vegetables were beautiful, delicious, inventive & perfect. The attention to detail was breathtaking. It was art on a plate & an incredible theatre. The whole team were welcoming, friendly and extremely professional. There’s a reason it’s the best restaurant in the world, it deserves its reputation & every one of its stars. Honoured to have been there. Cannot praise, recommend or thank them enough. A night we will never forget."

Geranium,50,"Excellent food, Excellent service","There's a reason this restaurant is currently ranked as Best in the World. The food is excellent, the service is impeccable, and the entire evening was truly an experience. I have a food allergy, and the restaurant graciously accommodated me. We opted against the wine pairing in favor of wine by the bottle, and the excellent sommelier was able to provide great advice when selecting from the 200+ page wine menu. I'm so glad to have had this once-in-a-lifetime experience!"

Geranium,50,Excellent Experience,"My wife and I had lunch here on a Friday. It’s expensive but its reputation is well-deserved.    I placed the reservation very early. It looked like lunches were easier to book than dinners and Friday lunches were easier to book than Saturday. Tables for two were harder to get than tables for four.    Food was very innovative and almost too pretty to eat. Attention to detail regarding presentation is second to none. There was one dish we thought was average. Everything else was excellent to perfect.    Service was friendly and professional. The sommelier/Red Sox fan was very helpful. The meal was well paced and lasted about three hours.    Prior to the dessert courses you can take a tour of the wine cellar and the facilities. It was very interesting and a nice break between courses.    We purchased a bottle of wine and some individual drinks. We ordered sherry for our last round and were surprised that they only carried one brand. I was expecting a list of 5-10 by the glass. Sherry must not be popular in Copenhagen but I still find it odd for a restaurant that has a wine list the size of a dictionary,    Not sure if it’s the best restaurant in the world but they make a compelling argument."

Geranium,50,5* service,"We visited Geranium in April 2022 in what was a delayed trip for my partner's 'big' birthday. We were scheduled for February but had to re-arrange due to Covid. The restaurant is set in a bright, airy space attached to the national football stadium. The view overlooks a park and is a serene, relaxing environment. The Spring Universe Menu was a delight from start to finish, local produce with interesting flavour combinations, perfectly balanced and served at a perfect pace. We were lucky to get an extra course in the form of some cake for the birthday boy and to sample our first Danish wine. Part way through lunch the food stopped for a tour of the restaurant which was a nice touch. The wine cellar was amazing and the staff kitchen and dining area as nice as the restaurant! Service was impeccable from the talented and friendly bunch of international staff. It truly was a special experience and we were delighted to see them awarded best restaurant in the world just a couple of months later."

Geranium,20,"Geranium, not up to 3-stars","Easygoing friendly service. A little too busy dining area with the preparatory kitchen in it. Obviously great dishes, but too skimpy. Leaving Geranium, having spent €1200 per couple we were hungry. Not ok having had lunch at what is supposed to be the #1 3-star restaurant in the world. There was no sequence of dishes amounting to a summit, and the balance between appetizers, salty courses and deserts were unbalanced with too much emphasis on deserts. Arriving there, we were still hungry, and we are not big eaters. Hope the chefs rise to ghe challenge and offer a sequence not only beautiful and interesting but actually worth the quite extortionate price Geranium cost."

Geranium,50,One of World’s Best Restaurants,"Geranium provides an excellent dining experience. We dined here on prior visits to Copenhagen and twice during our July 2022 stay. The food is the best anywhere, the service excellent and the wine list second to none. Thank you to everybody at Geranium for these wonderful dining experiences!"

Geranium,50,Simply PERFECT,"We had lunch for a birthday celebration and the menu was called the Summer Universe with 19 courses.  We did not take the wine tasting but followed the recommendation of the sommelier and ordered different bottles of wine.  Everything was perfect from the place, the staff, the wines and of course the menu. Every dishes were unique, intriguing, surprising. Every details were thought through from the choice of ingredients to the presentation in the plate. And all that in a very friendly atmosphere.    The pros  The food!!!!! Exceptionally creative and some unique taste never experienced before.  The wines recommended by our Australian sommelier. Each bottle was not only exceptional (especially the white wines) but also at decent prices (and the wine list had crazy expensive bottles),  The staff, very friendly and professional, from all nationality speaking English, french, Spanish.  The place, with large windows, view on the plating area.    The cons  The disappointment of not being able to thank the Chef Rasmus Kofoed directly as he was gone when we finished our lunch."

Geranium,50,The premier table in Copenhagen,"On the list of 50 best restaurants Geranium and Noma should change places.  Geranium has the immediacy (umiddelbarthed) and friendliness of its relaxed staff that Noma had in the early days, which greatly increases the enjoyment of the meal.  Every dish was 3-star quality.  During the meal we were brought a revised 99 page wine list since one item had been sold out. Four wine pairing alternatives with excellent choices and no oddities.  We still chose a bottle of champagne and one bottle of white based on excellent advice by our sommelier, the assistant restaurant manager. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."

Geranium,50,Nordic dream,"Nordic in every fiber, it makes me proud to taste the extensions of our age-old heritage, in these culinary fireworks for my tongue"

Geranium,50,Truly (and expensive) amazing experience,"Well deserved 3 Michelin Stars and world’s best 2nd position.  Honest and sophisticated cuisine, although meat has been completely removed, and fish is minimal, so vegetarian and vegans delight.  Despite not being vegetarian the whole experience was a top one. Be prepared to pay minimum of Euro 600 with wines, but worth the experience.  Nastasia the sommelier was great with us, and all staff very attentive."

Geranium,40,Fading Memories,"I can't say we didn't enjoy the food, and we definitely had professional and friendly service (although this was also the case in other restaurants in Copenhagen). When we left the restaurant after the meal, we felt satisfied. After all, we'd eaten in what's currently the second best restaurant in the world, and since winners are no longer included in the list, it's perhaps not unlikely that Geranium will top the San Pellegrino 50 Best in 2022. In any case, the experience was pleasant. But the very next day, I began to have doubts. What struck me was that most of the dishes turned out to be quite forgettable and the whole experience didn't leave any longer lasting impressions. I've had the opportunity to dine in some famous restaurants, such as Osteria Francescana, El Celler de Can Rocca and many others of similar quality. Compared to those restaurants (as well as some that were never in the top 3 to my knowledge), the food here wasn't so spectacular. This may be due to the new menu, which is limited to vegetables and seafood, but the very idea of serving 21 small courses (even the part of the tasting menu corresponding to main courses was mostly bite-sized) has its drawbacks. It's hard to focus on such a sequence of dishes and appreciate the better ones when they're gone after 2 bites. Usually at these top restaurants, even if you don't love the whole tasting menu, there are courses that are so great, delicious or clever that you have them as a reference point for future experiences (even at a restaurant like Eleven Madison Park, which I did not love, one or two courses would qualify). None of the dishes we ate at Geranium are in the same league as, say, the 5 ages of parmesan at Osteria. It seems as if the restaurant considers, for example, the ""flower"" dish with yellow beetroot as a signature dish of this menu, but in fact the vegetable cut as a flower isn't original, and even if the dish teaches you that you can do a lot with beetroot, that doesn't necessarily mean that it was the tastiest thing in the world. If you think about the entire menu, you suddenly notice that almost all (if not all) dishes were served cold or at room temperature. When we did the usual tour of the kitchen, no cooking seemed to be taking place. So there were no temperature contrasts or other signs of great cooking technique. This must've made life a lot easier for the chefs, but is that what 3-star cooking is all about? Then there's the presentation - yes, most of the dishes look good, but if you think about why, it's because of 2-3 repeated tricks. The first, as you might expect, is the use of flowers arranged with tweezers, the second the cutting of vegetables to resemble petals, and the third a kind of 'lattice' pattern baked in intricate shapes and placed on top of the main ingredients. All are attractive at first glance, but ultimately quite ordinary and easy to achieve. Although for me the food is above all other factors, I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the location and the decor. Again, neither is bad, but the offices of the FC Copenhagen football stadium and the area in which they're located aren't the most breathtaking and the interior, although bright and comfortable (the tables are large, the spacing between tables is excellent), is less impressive than in many other places. At a price approaching Parisian 3-star territory (but at least there portions are larger and many luxury ingredients are used), you shouldn't even talk about value for money. I chose the standard wine pairing, which was again OK, but not spectacular. At Celler de Can Rocca, I had the impression that the wines must've been made specifically for the courses served (or vice versa). Here, such a communion between wine and food wasn't even remotely in sight. Do I regret going? No, because I like fine dining and want to be able to form my own opinion. Would I recommend it to someone who's not interested in the latest foodie awards, lists, etc., but just wants to have a phenomenal meal, no matter what the cost? No, I'm afraid I wouldn't."

Geranium,50,Absolutely amazing,"Absolutely amazing! From the greeting in the front door, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the design, the outstanding service till the toilets- the whole package was so perfectly made. If you ever get the chance to experience this restaurant, go for it."

Geranium,50,Top Restaurant,Outstanding service and food. We went for the full autumn menu with heart and soil wine pairing. Generous glasses of wine. Nicely matched. Marbled Hake was something very special.

Geranium,50,Perfectly executed,A pleasure to visit Geranium and experience what can only be defined as perfection. It’s perfect raw materials executed perfectly with a light touch. Simply beautiful to look at the plates and delicious to eat. Unlike some of his contemporaries in Copenhagen- there is nothing that will shock or challenge you- it’s a very gentle and elegant place to eat - I keep using the word perfect as it’s the only one I think sums the experience up. The wine list is phenomenal and my advice would be to go for your own bottles as opposed to the wine pairing as truly there is sooooo much to choose from. The space is serene and calm - yet very casual in its vibe which is great. The service just impeccable….  What a lovely lunch we had - look forward to returning!

Geranium,50,Should have been #1,"From the reception at the base of the football stadion to the little farewell gift the service is immaculate, young, diverse and international. There is little more to say about the food, clean, fresh, surprising and beautifully presented with passion. The wine list is spectacular and they offer 4 options for paired wines. For the first time ever was I tempted to take one of those but in the end a Riesling from Klaus Peter Keller and a bottle of chateau rayas were more tempting. Difficult to compare with other great three stars in the world because the food is so unique and different. Maybe Central in Lima is the closest because that is differently unique. Comes at 3 star pricing but that is a given."

Geranium,50,Fabulous Dining Experience!,"Geranium has three Michelin stars. Dining there was a wonderful culinary experience: the atmosphere, food and service were each deserving of three stars. The food was spectacular and Alex, our waiter, was pleasant and always helpful. The wine list, too, was excellent. We will return to Copenhagen to dine at Geranium."

Geranium,50,Unique experience,Three michelin stars for a reason . An absolutely great dinner. Very expensive but deserve every single euro . Great service great view

Geranium,50,The perfect experience,"This was our first visit to a Michelin restaurant and I had no idea what to expect - I was even nervous a bit because I am pregnant and therefore somewhat restricted in my diet. I am not sure there are words to describe the experience !  From arrival to the end the service was superb. All staff members were excellent and what really impressed me was the communication between them. Everyone seemed to know all about us, our choices and our evening. Wow !  The food itself was marvellous and quite filling ! You can clearly see the amount of passion that goes into every dish.  While my partner went for the wine pairing, I chose their non-alcoholic juice pairing and I think that was the best part of the night for both of us. The spectacle of making my drinks and then their taste was amazing. I had no idea juice can be this fancy !!!  We loved it and we are considering going back. Two days later and I am still under the spell of the experience. Really well done everyone in the team !"

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Art and Elegance,"Food can be art and Restaurant Frederikshoj proves that art can be delicious as well. You know this isn't going to be a typical restaurant experience when you're greeted with an art instillation, first thing through the door, called ""The Last Supper"", which is a...More"

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,A highlight of our trip,Excellent food and service. one of the absolute highlights of our Danish gastronomy trip. We made our booking before they received their second star. I suspect it's going to be harder to get in now!

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,We were spoiled from start to finish,"Colours, textures, taste... everything was considered thoroughly to give us a sublime experience. There were even a small stools for the ladies where they could put their bags."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,The most fantastic food experience ever!!,Michelin restaurant. They play with food. Really! Go if you are a gourmet playchild! Wassim Hallal is a fantastic chef 😎

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Delicious,"The food and Wine was fantastic, the service was impeccable and the ambience cosy and relaxed. Came with my 92 years old grandmother, and acces was easy with a wheelchair. Loved every moment of it, and will definitely visit again!"

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Great Dining,It is good restaurant to visit and got the experience of the good food and tasty food . It is worth to go there and dine .

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,The perfect birthday party,"Frederikshøj is alone at the top - skills, perfection and gourmet is second to none. The chef controls the kitchen and his signature is visible in all the food."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Excellent food,"A sensory experience, the tastes look and smell all comes together. The way they served caviar, with sorbet was my bedst expirence of caviar ever. Exxelent selection of wines to go with the food."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,20,Good food but ....,The quality of the food is arguably good - BUT the prices are bordering exorbitant and the service is inadequate though embracing in an arrogantly embracing manner.

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,High class,This restaurant is undoubtedly the best restaurant in Aarhus. They create small masterpieces of dishes. I can strongly recommend all foodies to visit the best 1- Michelin star restaurant in Aarhus. Besides the services is in top with a lot of toptuned waiters and waitress'.

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Please - go for your own sake 🙏😄,This is a excellent restaurant!! Wines are great 👍 Waiters are very professional!! The foods are excellent. The interior is fine. GO THERE - if you are in Århus

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Outstanding,"Absolutely loved our visit to Restaurant Frederikshøj - the service was impeccable, and the food (with maybe the slight exception of the slightly odd edible rocks) sublime. The chocolate deathstar was our favourite course. Our table - looking out over the gardens towards the water was perfect for a warm summer evening. Highly recommended."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Temple in the making,"No hype. Pound for pound a Gem of a restaurant - humble and focused on delivering a complete dining experience - sommeliers young and ambitious with no snobbery, but genuine passion. Staff competent and confident - kitchen stellar."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,40,Pushing the bounderies,"Had a meal with friends and the first thing to say is it's a very nice dining room indeed.  Lots of space on the table and between each table. Lovely view of the sea in the distance.  Waiters were very friendly and as a result the restaurant was not at all stuffy for a fine dining experience.  We chose the 7 course tasting menu with wine paring which ends up being about 10 courses by the time they've amused your bouche.  The first 4 courses pretty much involved fish and were absolutely first class. Lots of intricate cooking, incredible flavours and no short supply of theatre.  Main meat course of beef was good but slightly let the show down versus what had come before.  Puddings were elaborate but probably the theatre outperformed the food. It got a little gimmicky in parts.  Wine pairing was staggeringly good.    A very good experience overall with some great cooking on show. Will 100% return."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,30,"Discreet food, great wines but It need crazy touch","Great service, good food, but in dishes it need more craziness. Too institutional. Excellent signature dish."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Haute Cusine in great setting,"The restaurant design is very stylish with artwork and also a great view over a park to the sea, including some deers feeding. Service and food was excellent and we enjoyed a great experience. They even brought the Swiss chef to serve us some food as they know our nationality. One course was served in the preparation area and we could talk to the chefs and enjoy how they prepare the food. The dessert in a sugar bowl with vanilla smoke was almost worth the whole evening."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Frederikshøj - Outstanding (in the actual sense of the word...),"Being a fairly small family, we took the chance and celebrated our son's confirmation at Restaurant Frederikshoej on 29th of April - chance because Frederikshoej is upscale and not my idea of a family friendly restaurant welcoming children end the Being a fairly small family, we took the chance and celebrated our son's confirmation at Restaurant Frederikshoej on 29th of April 2017 – ‘chance’ because Frederikshøj is upscale and not my idea of a family friendly restaurant welcoming small children end the elderly a like.    Happily, I was entirely wrong. In an effortless manner, the waiters made it an evening to remember - right from comforting our daughter breaking a glass, patiently listening to tales from the grand parents and giving our son a tour of the kitchen. I know Frederikshøj from business dinners. I can definitely recommend the casual version of Frederikshøj being seated at a great table overlooking the forest and bay.    The ambience was extremely important, and Frederikshøj came through. Obviously, the center of attention was the food and wine. We had 6 courses with wine menu for the adults and a simply outstanding cider (non alcoholic, unfermented) menu for our son. This is absolutely a worthy alternative to the wine menu, and you should try it on occasion.    The 6 courses and the snacks along with them were all extremely well composed and presented – and highly delicious. The Bresse chicken and the lamp were clear standouts – also amongst the children at the table; prepared by steam and not sous vide as it turned out. Frederikshøj has a thing for French wine. I do not, and I had hoped for a broader mix but came to appreciate the wines and the generous servings, as the evening moved on.    The desert also stood out – rhubarb always makes for an excellent desert. The desert, however, was rivalled by the legendary ‘sweets bar on wheels’ with homemade toffees, ice, filled chocolates – with no restrictions other than your sense of guilt. This is a must try at Frederikshøj. Throughout the evening, the waiters and chefs made it look so easy and, almost, casual.    I have had excellent dinners at several restaurants in Aarhus. To me, Frederikshøj is – in most respects – levels above other excellent restaurant in Aarhus. It was pricy but well worth it. Thanks for a memorable evening, where also the old and young visitors – out of their environment – had a terrific evening."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,World class dining,"It's been discussed and pointed out many times why this restaurant only have 1 Michelin star. But, with or without 2 or 3 stars, this is dining heaven. All around this restaurant is world class, food, wines, environment and top service from staff. A dining heaven."

Restaurant Frederikshoj,50,Amazing,"Can't rave enough about this place! Food was beyond amazing, the staff were incredible and the ambience was spot on. I will honestly be recommending this to people for ever. 6 course menu was the perfect number f courses to be full enough!"

Kiin Kiin,10,Don’t eat here! Social pumping and toxic environment,"Been at kin kin many times but after watching the documentary on TV2 about the social pumping, toxic environment and underpaid staff on Kin Kin I will never go there to support a system like that. They even get staff from Thailand and threatening them with sending them home if they don’t overwork or get to work even when they are sick. Don’t use your money here!"

Kiin Kiin,10,Horrible working conditions for Asian staff,"The food is great - I have been here on several occasions. However, the staff is divided into 2 castes - the Asian group that works there more or less as forced labor - slaving up to 70 - 80 hours a week. And the Danish group that works under union restrictions and therefore are treated well. There is a lot of talk about this in the Danish media and the last time I visited I actually watched the (I believe) Thai staff and they looked seriously overworked and burned out. I cannot support the restaurant any longer"

Kiin Kiin,50,Elegant Thai Cuisine,"My wife and I enjoyed a memorable dinner at Kiin Kiin. The evening started with a warm welcome and some snacks downstairs in the bar, before being escorted upstairs to our table. We had a cozy corner table near a window, which was a great spot to enjoy this multi course tasting menu.  The food was wonderful and special. I didn't think there were any low points, but I think the special one was the Tom Yum soup that was prepared at the table in the vacuum coffee brewer. That was a real show!  We went with the nonalcoholic juice tasting which paired well with our dinner options, but seemed quite filling.  The service was friendly and we didn't feel rushed during our time there. The entire experience was well worth our time and we would recommend Kiin Kiin to others looking for a high end meal in Copenhagen."

Kiin Kiin,10,Very bad experience for the very expensive bill we paid,"I grew up eating Thai food in Asian countries, including Thailand, and in Los Angeles. This is the worst, least authentic, overpriced Thai food, period.  The food quality was mediocre at best.  The service was bad. The waitress had one hand carrying dirty dishes and the other serving us appetizers in the lounge area. The bathroom was dirty and the stalls had no locks. I complained about it but no action was taken.  It's a three hour meal with 70% downtime.  Worst dining experience for the price we pay."

Kiin Kiin,50,Unbelievable. Beyond fantastic.,"Other worldly is right. Absolutely best meal of my life! I think you have to enjoy bold, strong flavors … lemongrass, ginger, chilis, galangal, lime, fish sauce. Truly amazing. Superb.    If you live these things you will never regret spending a lovely evening at Kiin Kiin.    If you don’t like strong and bold flavors then pass this up. But if you do, u cannot find a better meal anywhere!"

Kiin Kiin,20,Below average,Food was very average. The spare ribs were tough and the calamarie chewy. The green curry was tasty enough but nothing special. Ambience was ok but probably better for a take away than a sit down restaurant experience.

Kiin Kiin,50,"Amazingly Innovative Dinner, Highly Recommended","We had excellent memories from a previous dinner a few years back. tasting menu started with many delicious tasty bits. Our favourits dishies included Tom yam soup, Yellow curry crab salad, Braised pork belly, and the Pandan Matcha ice cream. The service was excellent and very attentive. The wine paring menu was well matched with the dinner and generous."

Kiin Kiin,30,Not worth the money and not the Michelin standard,"Not worth the money.  I have been so lucky to have visitors Kiin Kiin for some years ago, in which it was an amazing experience.  This time, however, was a different story. We had informed about allergies prior and on the night despite that they served us three courses that enclosed just that. They forgot the cutlery for one serving and did not notice. We had several waiters, and they forgot what courses we had had and missed.  The food is still amazing, but it is not the same story, service and experience as previously."

Kiin Kiin,50,Unreal Experience at Kiin Kiin- Other Worldly,"We took some friends to dinner here during a trip to Copenhagen in May 2023. We had the BEST experience. We were so impressed by everything.    A couple highlights included:  - the prep for dinner experience, drinks and snacks in the living room area  - the pace of the coursings, not too fast, not too slow- was perfect for us  - My friends did the alcoholic drink pairings, I did the non-alcoholic pairings- and everybody was pleased. I usually get a bunch of sugary juices and these were much more balanced. My friends raved about the wines    There were traditional Thai elements here but it definitely surpassed any Michelin thai experience we've had, at home in Washington DC, or elsewhere."

Kiin Kiin,50,I recommend this place if you are visiting Copenhagen and looking for a fine dining Thai restaurant 😘❤️❤️🇹🇭🇩🇰,I love it 🥰 all of staff and crew members are so kind and friendly and they make me feel like I’m at home foods are so excellent 👍

Kiin Kiin,50,Just excellent,"Excellent food and service! We had the tasty menu, all very good. Very nice concept with some appetizers down stairs and so eating the other excelleny dishes upstairs in the dining room! Very nice personell. We recommit the place will for sure come back!"

Kiin Kiin,10,Worst thai experience ever,"The place as en environment is nice. The food was terrible. Very pricy, the plates were one small bite each and most of them were bad. Wondering how did this place got a Michelin star altogether. The service was excellent. Apart from that though if this would be my first time experiencing thai food I would be disappointed."

Kiin Kiin,50,Something very different,"A favourite meal from a recent European trip. Many flavours to play with and plenty of theatre to go with the meal. Right from the start there is a lot of thought that's gone into every step of the experience, with so many fun treats throughout.    I also liked that their cookery books are on the table for you to peruse, very interesting to see how they made some of the introductory snacks and to learn a bit more about the melding of philosophies on display.    The only real negative point was that I had questions about the food and the wait staff were a tad less knowledgeable than I'd expect them to be at a restaurant like this, a few times not knowing the answers and showing no enthusiasm for finding out. Not a major flaw but if you're paying this much you expect them to excel at the fine margins.    Would definitely visit again on a future trip to Copenhagen."

Kiin Kiin,20,Worth of Michelin star?,"That was our second visit to the restaurant within a couple of years. First dinner and tasting menu was superb and mind-blowing, one of the best for ever !  Unfortunately that was not a case at this time. Menu did not startled as we expected, on the other hand it was good but the not worth of €€€ and Michelin *  Waitress was a very precious young man, but it revealed later that he was a student and not a professional waitress (so not his fault). One of the pairing wines was corked (not sure is that a right word?) and again it came out that there was no sommelier at the restaurant….  My friend who was also at dinner wrote later on directly to the restaurant in order to give constructive feedback, unfortunately they never reply."

Kiin Kiin,50,An Incredible Dinner,"Beyond Danish/Asian Perfection    This is a perfection of presentation with delicious food. Each course, snack was used too, was beyond surprise and incredible to watch. Our soup was prepared in front of us with unexpected process that brought intense flavor beyond. The usual foam, fire, cotton candy, smoke were all used but with the most unusual unexpected presentations. I actually gasped once an unexpected but wonderful food item was revealed.. (not give the surprise away). We have been to several Michelin restaurants but this place is yet beyond. We are now home in USA continuing to talk and reveal some most amazing gastronomical wonders."

Kiin Kiin,30,Not as good as last visit,We have visited Kiin Kiin a couple of years ago and we remember the explosion of different tastes in the meal. Unfortunately this is not the case anymore. Only a few of the dishes (curry dishes) gave us the same experience. Service was mediocre.

Kiin Kiin,40,Great bug noisy place,"I was here more then ten years ago, the restaurant has one more Michelin star. It remains worth a visit due to the exceptional fine Thai cuisine. It can be crowdy and loud so don’t go for a nice romantic evening"

Kiin Kiin,10,Stressful and not at all Michelin,"The food was okay- good flavors and innovative execution and the wait staff friendly. Our seating however took away from the overall experience. We were sat in the corner by the kitchen and staff work area where you could feel, hear and smell the hustle and bustle of the noisy and chaotic behind the scenes- a not so relaxing experience especially after several hours of travels. We did request to be sat elsewhere as there were a quite a few empty tables in the main dining area that remained so throughout our entire dinner till closing, but our request was not honored. Perhaps we didn't meet their arbitrary qualification worthy of a seat in the main dining room, just in the corner. This did leave a bad aftertaste and made for an overall stressful dining experience."

Kiin Kiin,50,Good food and good experience,"My first time in a Michelin restaurant and it did not disappoint. We got 8 course menu with wine-parring. Excellent service with explanation of each dish. Great challenge of the taste buds and overall very good and high quality food.    Not only a meal, but a learning experience."

Kiin Kiin,50,A visit to a one (1) star Michelin Thai restaurant,"We had a visit to Kiin Kinn last weekend Saturday 21/5 and would like to share our experience that we had in this amazing restaurant.    We LOVED it…    Very innovative dishes, presentations of food, flavors, wine pairing, attentive service, interior design, etc etc…    However, the human presentation of the dishes was a bit difficult to follow, since it was so many persons involved that took care of our table. Since each and everyone had their own volume of speach and different nationalities.. But in the end of the day thats just a small thing..    All in all, this restaurant are definately worth a Michelin star.. It was such a pleasurable evening!    So MASSIVE THANKS to all the people involved in creating a great evening for us with amazing flavors, great service and a very cosy set up in your restaurant..    Wish you continued success and I/we look very much forward to visit you again in the future!    Brgds, P, R and A"

Kiin Kiin,20,Expecting more of a Michelin restaurant,"Went here with high expectations, and has to say that we expect more of a Michelin restaurant. We have eaten at Michelin restaurants before, and what I learned from this experience, is that it takes a LOT more to get into the Guide in a smaller city, than in Copenhagen. By all means, the quality of the food was not poor, but a bit boring and monotone. In my opinion it is not worth it to pay 5000DKK, and then afterwards jut remembering the taste of coconut milk, and none of the dishes. It seemed like a lot of effort was put into the service, but is it inventive or just ridiculous to shake a box of seeds just to make two cookies reveal themselves?    Unfortunately the restaurant could not even make a taxibooking in a proper way. By the table we was asked if we needed a taxi, which we did. 5 min later, one of the staff came to our table and told us that the taxi was waiting. When we got down, we could see that he did not have a clue. We waited for about six more minutes in cold weather, and three non-occupied taxis passed us, but none of them was our. I than decided to take the next one, despite the staffmember waiting with us, telling us it was not the one. This is SLOPPY service, for any restaurant.    My advice, is to dine another place."

Kiin Kiin,20,Disappointment,"Had been looking forward to dine hers, but what a disappointment. We had the tasting menu which was okay, nothing special and nothing from the meal stands out. The service was really bad, chaotic, something I’ve never experienced in a Michelin star restaurant."

Kiin Kiin,50,An experience I think I never forget.,Wauw Wauw Wauw  This was by far one of the best restaurants experiences in my life.  Everything was perfect. So many regimes flavors put together in a perfect manner.    We both went with the juice menu. I must say - It eas perfect to accompany the menu.    If you have the chance - go here.

Kiin Kiin,50,Still great,"The theatre menu is still a strong selection of their greatest hits. The deconstructed tom yum in particular hits the marks, but the snacks are still the most interesting part of the meal. Kiin Kiin is always a winner."

Kiin Kiin,30,Hiden costs,"We choose theater experience for the evening.  The price for that menu is 650 dkk.  They sugest to order something to drink at the begining and not realy inform you that you pay extra very high price. glas of wine 120 dkk.  They charge extra for everything even tap water 50 dkk.  We had impression that wine or juice specialy composed to come with theater menu dishes is included. We were wrong. Wine menu costs 500 dkk extra and juice menu 375.    Even though the food was exceptionally tasty, we feel cheated becouse of the hidden costs which have doubled the bill."

Kiin Kiin,20,Not up to Michelin* standard,"Not even close to Michelin* standards. Food OK but nothing so special. The waiters were busy running from a table to an other and not really giving time to clients, some even behaved like they rather would have been somewhere else. Amuse bouche came on top of each other, so there was no time to taste the individual dishes. Overall the feeling was a bit chaotic. Michelin stars normally guarantee a great dining experience but we did not have one."

Kiin Kiin,20,Stay away,"This was quite disappointing. The starters were Good, but the meny was not as expected for the price and What we had heard of this place."

Kiin Kiin,40,Less would be so much more,"This is an excellent Thai restaurant. It takes you almost four hours to get through the menu which is quite uneven. There are no bad courses but after the spicy salad the courses are not as great until you reach the first desert which is again stunning. The foie gras is unnecessary course and is overcooked. They should work on their wine list. Rieslings great but please dry ones please no spatelese or auslese . Why so much raveneau Chablis that gets killed by the spices, same for a large selection of Armand Rousseau and Comtes Lafon. They clearly have not understood wine and food combinations and the sommelier is a waste of time. I saw a review of somebody who left hungry, that to me is a mistery. This restaurant has the bones to be something great if only it could show some restraint and get a true wine professional. Overall still one of the best Thais bin Europe."

Kiin Kiin,10,Terrible food and place,"We went to kin kin restaurant which is supposed to be a nice place, however the food was disgusting with really too much spicy, for an exorbitant price. The staff is running everywhere and looked overwhelmed which makes the atmosphere stressful and noisy !  I DO NOT RECOMMEND !!!"

Kong Hans Kaelder,50,Oh what a night,"There is a reason this is one of the Copenhagen flagships in gastronomy for decades.  The recption is warm...all chefs in the kitchen called out a greeting and the front staff know your are comming  Proper well starched table cloth and napkins is a strong indicator that this is a place that does classic old school service and yet they are still down to earth and friendly. It is wonderful to see the classic waiter virtues are upheld. When napkins are replaced a new one is delivered carried with cutlery. And there is flambé as a choice for dessert an other chance for the waiter to show their skill.    Food is all the way French. From the frogs legs appetiser to the macaroons on the dessert trolley. All servings extremely well executed. Menu changes every month so no need to go through that as it will be different when you go yourself. Just know you can count on it to be sharp, tasty and beautiful.    The dessert trolley was a hit and I loved they was doing pineapple flambé...I haven't had that for ages, as a supplement to all the little sweet things.    A strong wine list also by the glass and there eis of course also a wine paring.    A wonderful evening and the only finger I can put on any thing is the lady from the front desk helped with a few servings with out tying her hair up. Not a big deal just strange since everything else was so sharp and by the book classic high end hospitality."

Kong Hans Kaelder,50,"Amazing, exceptional, wow, wow, wow!","There are not enough superlatives to describe just how amazing the food, staff and wine is at Kong Hans Kælder.    A true culinary event, we spent over 3 hours being wowed by the service and impeccable quality in this theatre of food.    Located in a discreet side road in central Copenhagen you enter down some steps into a stunning vaulted cellar, passing a brigade of busy chefs in a kitchen as you are guided to your table by a member of their exceptional front of house team.    There is only one menu, a stunning tasting fare of french culinary delights. All served like a work of art and explained in depth by the serving team.    Starting with a number of snacks, you move through a number of mains to the desert finale. An absolute event throughout.    The over three hours flew by in what seemed less than half the time.    I have eaten at many fine dining restaurants, Kong Hans Kælder is for my wife and I, the pinnacle and a 10/10 would not seem fair, 20/10 more like it. Simply the best restaurant I have visited to date, and by some margin!    It was not cheap, but excellence seldom is. Depending on your wine you can run to £1,250+ per head, obviously substantially less with a less premium wine selection.    For lovers of fine dining it is a must visit."

Kong Hans Kaelder,20,Bad experience,"Today we had a very unpleasant experience in a restaurant that we went to a few years back, and on this occasion, it was disappointing - The service, the food, the price.  To quote a few experiences, during the starters, we were presented with a “snack” ehich was a croquette, poorly done, but the worst of all was when we ate it and found rests of food that shouldn’t be there (nails from some frog legs in the snack menu).  Moreover, what we ordered from the physical menu was changed, meaning that we ordered something off the menu, but were presented with a different dish.  The chef never presented himself. The sous-chefs presented the plates in an impersonal and imprecise manner.  The starters were nothing but soul-less dishes, basically menu-fodder; too many tartlets with mousse and plates with no essence, save for 2 plates: the turbot and the deer, which were good, but in a too small ration.  It’s a non-recomendable restaurant, not by quality nor by price. It is not worth it.  It’s losing the opportunity for a good dinner in Copenhaguen."

Kong Hans Kaelder,50,Excellent,"The service was super friendly, attentive, and informative. Every dish was excellent, but the seafood were my favorites. The extra cheese cart had an extensive selection. Go with a very empty stomach, especially if you decide to add the cheese cart."

Kong Hans Kaelder,30,Lovely food - avoid the wine menu,"An experience. Very delicious food. A bit too much of a sweet finish. It would be nice if you could choose between ending with sweets or cheese. The latter can be added before the sweets but then you will become very full. Could be nice if you could choose between the two.  We went for the entry wine menu going along with the dinner (priced at almost 300 USD). Three white wines, two red wines and a sweet desert wine. Only one of the whites (a Pinot Gris from Alsace) stood out and was well balanced to the scrimps. The other wines was at best mediocre with little to no tertiary notes, except for a Hungarian white from Tokay. One of the red wines goes for 25 USD in the shops. Select your wine from the wine cellar might be a better option."

Kong Hans Kaelder,50,Special occasion dinner,Expensive but worth it for a blow out luxury experience and incredible French inspired food using Danish local produce

Kong Hans Kaelder,50,WOW WOW WOW WOW! the first restaurant in Copenhagen to receive a Michelin star !!,"Kong Hans Kælder was the first restaurant in Copenhagen to receive a Michelin star back in 1983 and has kept its sky-high standards ever since.  It holds two stars in Guide Michelin Nordic Cities and to this day it's still a point of reference when it came to pleasure and luxury in Copenhagen.  Kong Hans Kælder still serves classic French cuisine. They use the best produce from near and far, and the processing is done with the utmost care and respect for the raw materials integrity.  Where many of the modern kitchens make use of advanced techniques and imaginative presentation, the owners have chosen to turn the tables and base the kitchen on more classic virtues.  this place is just impeccable from architecture, service, food, cocktails!!! wow wow wow!! its surely a place we will be back to .  must visit!!"

Kong Hans Kaelder,50,"very good, loved the cheese wagon",I ate at Kong Hans with my partner last year and was very happy with the service and the food and would definitely go back.

Kong Hans Kaelder,30,"Not to my taste, catastrophic waiters","Heidsieck Winemakers-Dinner at Kong Hans  Really nice arrangement, and the special company of champagne dinner occupied most of the restaurant.  However, the food not really to my taste, and was very far from 2 Michelin Stars. The pate en croute was really delicious actually. The turbot was good, but a very small bite, and the sauce was too strong, nearly bitter - for that exquisite fish. The ravioli had spiny lobster and not lobster as I understood, and again the bisque was extremely dominating and it was not nice eating the spiny lobster chunks in the ravioli. Nothing elegant about that dish. The Sashi peppersteak tasted like Bavarian sausage with mashed potatoes. The dessert was fantastic. One star down for the food.  Service was really below standard. I am not sure who they had called in for this event, but if it was the regular staff at Kong Hans, then they have a serious problem. A female waiter was extremely clumsy and unexperienced and a male waiter was simply a disaster, he basically did not know how to be a waiter. For example, at some point he tried to take my plate several times when I was clearly still eating. Last time I tried that must have been at a Brasilia beach bar? One more star down for the service.  Just clarifying that not all waiters were a disaster, there was also a young man from Østermarie, Bornholm - he was world class ⭐  Sorry Kong Hans - but not up to standard - I can assign a maximum of 3 TripAdvisor stars."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Incredible,"Simply incredible. It wasnt just food, it was simply mind blowing experience. I could not recommend it enough. Food, ambience the way the staff made us feel so cared for and so welcome. Thank you 🙏"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Nice restaurant,"Everything you can expect from very high quality restaurant:) Food was good, staff was amazing. Maybe but to expensive but it is what it is."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,The stars well earned!,"The stars well earned!    We’ve visited 180 degrees 3 times. First without the star, then with one star and now with two stars. The level of the experience has indeed raised accordingly. The 6+ courses and 5 hour dinner was absolutely amazing. Nothing but praises to say. One recommendation: do not miss the caviar, it’s absolutely delicious – one of the best we’ve ever had! Already waiting for the next visit."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,180 Degrees Two Michelin Star Restaurant,"Our experience at 180 Degrees two Michelin Star restaurant in Tallinn Estonia was absolutely amazing. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated very special. Drinks on arrival was served by Mark who’s knowledge, professionalism and personality was very welcoming, he just new when to approach for conversation and when to retreat. The restaurant itself is very smart modern with a central kitchen, perfect for watching the team prepare our food. The table service was like a miliary operation with personality, each and every member of the staff are attentive and personable. We had the six course tasting menu with the wine pairing. Each course starting with the Welcome Snacks served in the lounge to the Kaluga Caviar & cheese selection served by Jeremy were delightful. Some of the ingredient combinations surprised us, however, they worked so well. The pairing wines served by Kevin again surprised, Kevin is such a nice guy with the knowledge and deliver that is second to none. Chef (Matthias Diether) even took time out of his busy evening to speak with us and allowed us to have a photo taken with him in front of the 180 Degree logo. We would strongly recommend this restaurant."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Gurmee experience.,"Beautiful restaurant, excellent food, amazing drinks, perfect service, but kind of strict rules for customers and therefore lacking ambience. Definitely worth visiting for a wonderful gurmee experience."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,The best food experience of my life,Amazing dinner. Service was so perfect. The food was the best I ate all my life. I don’t forget the best cheeses you can find in the country.

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,A feast of tastes,"Excellent! Brilliant! Worth every penny! Matthias Diether has created something i can call ""Kitchen of Art!""."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Delightful!,"Our dinner at the chef’s table was an unique, wonderful and delicious experience in every aspect. Thanks to all the team for an amazing evening. Luckily for us, Kevin decided not to stay home alone at Christmas! Merci aussi aux Normands pour la sélection de fromages et le dessert fabuleux!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,"Ecxellent food, truly amazing experience.","Excellent food, every dish and mocktail is like an artwork, beautiful and very tasty. We enjoyed the experience very much. Surely worth to visit!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Incredible Adventure!,"Our meal was an extremely special experience! The food was exceptional and the service was on point. I recommend the mocktail tasting option. My partner ordered the wine but the Sommelier did an amazing job of including me in the story of every glass he poured. If you are looking to treat yourself, visit Tallinn and book ahead at 180°."

180 Degrees Restaurant,30,"Excellent food, extremely slow service","Very good food but very slow service, we sat there for almost 4 hrs (from 20 to midnight) for the dinner 6 course menu. You will be paired with other customers and served at the same time. In our case the other couple was very slow and we suffered due to that as well. Maybe serve every table individually and at their own pace?  The food as well as the cocktails were excellent, wine pairing sometimes didn't work very well."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Creative food in a stylish atmosphere,"The restaurant is located about 30 minutes by foot from Tallinn old town in fancy Noblessner - a former submarine shipyard turned into a posh seafront quarter. The interior is very stylish and modern with amazing views of the port. We were greeted in the bar area where cocktails and the first appetizers were served. The restaurant itself has an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs prepare the meals. We enjoyed a six-course menu, converted into a pescatarian version for one of us, which was strong in flavor and highly creative. Think celery in a dessert or red cabbage with chocolate. Just to be clear - the taste was unusual, but amazing. Anything creative made total sense, nothing seemed to be done just to provoke or do something out of the ordinary for the sake of it. When Guide Michelin was first introduced to Estonia back in 2022, the restaurant was awarded one star, just one year later the second star was earned. We found the menu’s composition, flavor pairing and strong taste certainly star-worthy.  Service was attentive, the sommelier and the young gentlemen who introduced the cheese from the amazing cheese board were so passionate about their job and what they had to offer that we enjoyed our dinner even more."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Great experience,"Excellent atmosphere, great food and the mocktails! All in all a wonderful experience, highly recommend!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,"Great staff, nice location and excellent food","The best service ever. Staff was attentive and super friendly. And then the food.... it was super. Surprised positively with tastes and quality. We had the best ever steak and it was worth every euro we spent. Also fish was great, kids even ate caviar.  The best ever restaurant experience"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Amazing. Highly recommended!,"Amazing experience, super professional staff and chef. Will definitely come back. We had chefs menu. Freaking awesome! Highly recommended!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Worth it!,It’s a superb place! On all accounts. Gluten allergic non-alcoholic no issue what so ever. Team atmosphere absolutely spot on!

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Spice up your tasting experience in 180 Degrees!,"Amazing atmosphere, super professional staff, felt just like I was meant to be there all along. Every dish is crafted as an art piece, flavors are rich and new. I was kind of anxious of having some taste I wouldn't like, but I was just blow away! Highly recommend to people who are bored of usual tastes and want to spice it up.  Some negative stuff we noticed and told our waiter as well: some of the cooks really are not that good with communicating their passion to the food they make, some were really hard to understand due to not speaking loud/clearly enough. There were exeptional and great waiters as well, but some might need some ""public"" speaking courses. :)    PS! Encourage you to try the non-alcoholic drink package! There were many exciting ones there, you won't regret it!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Absolutely fabulous,"This is absolutely heavenly place. Food is masterpiece each dish is a piece of art and taste is beyond this world. Service was superb. Wine is excellent. The whole experience is worth of the cost. It's a lifetime experience! the dinner took 4 hours, but time was flying, and I cannot find a single thing to complain about. Great thanks to the Chef (who was there the whole time) and the amazing team! I recommend 100% or more!!! Will return!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Superb!,"Absolutely must go when visiting Tallinn, Estonia. Beautful place by the sea and harbor. Great tastes!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,A visit from England to experience a culinary delight,"It was day three of their new menu, simply put , you could see the team working so hard to make it as perfect as possible . We were sat at the chefs table, the restaurant in general was vibrant , full on the night and in point of fact we were actually late and yet still , nothing was a bother. The staff are professional, the floor staff know their business , the chefs are focused and we have to say it was just that , a culinary delight worthy of the visit. Starting in the bar area we were presented with 4 lovely appetisers which sat well on the pallet and we chose a delicious white wine to accompany them . We then moved to the chefs table which is spacious and extremely comfortable , the restaurant is airy and spacious and you never feel you have to listen intently as you go through the courses as they are explained to you , but still there is a lovely atmosphere around you . The wines were superb accompanying each course and the evening flowed . The staff were we felt honest , they explained it as day three of the new menu and you could see them working as a team and learning at the same time and that has to be applauded.  We never questioned the cost , it was €600 yes but to be honest , having experienced other Michelin restaurants in Tallinn , we just knew we had experienced the market leader and we will return for sure . We feel that we found a diamond and they will constantly polish it to strive for perfection . Until next time , thank for the amazing experience. Christine & Trevor"

180 Degrees Restaurant,30,Stressing atmosphere and good food,"4 hours sitting behind a plain white table under a harsh gestapo lamp and trying to ignore really loud “lounge music”; at the same time exposed to everyone, feeling like a fish in aquarium, every move is carefully watched by many people - recommend it only to people with strong nerves. They sadly couldn’t do anything with the light nor change the table so we were happy when the evening ended and could come back to our cozy and happy home.  Stressed energy; serious but exceptionally focused and professional staff.  Good food, especially the sauces and fantastic culinary technicues but the whole package was not worth such money (app. 600€ for 2). Introduced as a “travel of tastes” - for us it was more like a Pabel of tastes, no logical connections between the dishes, though each one had superb quality. A lot of foam in every dish in some reason :D Some cool surprises with culinary effects and again - the service was absolutely excellent! Fantastic wine choises!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,30,Great food but no comfort,"Foods excellent but no comfort at restaurant hall at all. Customers spend there four hours as an average. Bright spotlight in the ceiling above our heads was like sun during night we did not expect and stuff was not able to dim or switch off as per our friendly remark. Background music repeated fiew futuristic phrases all night long we are able to repeat even some days later. Dining room is like big hall wo any sections meant for privacy and comfort. Foods extremely soohisticated as you may presume, 5-7 different tastes mixed into one meal. No any clean tastes of delicious meat, fish etc they offer"

180 Degrees Restaurant,10,Failure,"were in this restaurant a few days ago, it's a complete failure. The 6 course dinner took 4.5 hours. The Atlantic mackerel is clearly spoiled. There is no concept of a gastrotheatre. everything is mixed and a lot of foam. The waiters mixed up the drinks. When serving, the food fell and fell apart in the plate. inaccurate delivery. This is not a Michelin star, this is a failure!    On the one of photos below, is noodles from the ""white truffle"" that was hiding somewhere in the kitchen, but not for our eyes. There he probably left his unforgettable smell)  on the positive side - the wine list, excellent! But the price tag is horse."

180 Degrees Restaurant,30,Surprise for my dear friend,"Cool experience, the food was nice but it felt that in two of the dishes the sauces were the same or very similar. Overall a nice experience but very expensive, will I return, maybe."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Astonishing,"One of the best Michelin Restaurants we ever been.  We was welcome with genuine hospitality, the Lounge with the fire place is simply gorgeous after walking under the snow.  The food is top level, tasty innovative but no to minimalistic.  A remark for the wine selection, very exciting and different wines well paired, one of the best explanation ever for wines, with history and small information about every one, different than the classic varieties and how it taste.  Warn and no invasive service, very good service that made our special night perfect.  White truffle was a surprise, find this quality in Tallinn.  A remark for the Caviar, far away the best we ever had in a Restaurant.  Congratulations to the staff."

180 Degrees Restaurant,10,Bafflingly bad customer service,"Absolutely horrible service. We booked 1 month in advance for my 30th birthday, and the day before the booking, the staff called us to ask about any intolerances. I said I have a dairy intolerance and to please leave any sauces containing dairy on the side. This small detail proved to be too much for the restaurant to handle, as they apparently need 72 hours prior notice to make any changes, even putting the SAUCE ON THE SIDE. Absolutely baffling. We spent 20 minutes on the phone arguing and could not come to a compromise. I stressed that I don't have an allergy, just an intolerance and just wanted to have the sauce on the side so I could use it sparingly. Apparently, this was too difficult to prepare for 28 hours in advance. This has completely ruined the experience, and I cannot believe the customer would be treated this way in a Michelin-star restaurant."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Unforgettable experience,"This was my first experience at Michelin star restaurant, everything was amazing, service, taste of every bite, stories told for wines, food etc... Different level of experience. A bit expensive but it was expected."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,A 2 Michelin Star Experience!,"This experience was simply amazing!  My evening started at the lounge where I enjoyed a really good cocktail and the first snacks.    Then I decided to go with the 6courses menu, the dishes were getting better and better!  If you choose the white truffle from Alba the chef will come personally at the table !  The wine pairing is also a great moment of discovery! All of them are interesting and match the food perfectly.  The cheeses were all coming directly from France by Bernard Antony !    I loved every details of my evening, everything is done with the most attention. The kitchen is like an open orchestra where everybody is moving in perfect coordination.  The service was perfect as well, Luke was super professional and friendly.    I recommend this place for the people who want to have a truly experience of a Michelin Restaurant, with the best products and very kindly service.    Thank you again for this wonderful evening!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,20,Understaffed and overprized experience to dissapoint in many ways,"For a Michelin star restaurant that has above the average prices I would not expect this type of experience. 6 course dinner took over 4,5 hours! Most of the time spend was waiting. The staff even suggested us to strech our legs between dishes to pass the time  I liked how the dinner started in the lounge. Small bites to eat and a drink worked well. The dinner was not surprising. Quality was ok on most parts. Chicken was the low point - it was so dry that I almoust sent it back  Wine pairing was clearly designed to bring money in, not to impress and match the food. Easy drinking wines with really high price!  You would expect to be dazzeled when paying around 600€ for dinner for 2. In the end I was just hoping the experience to end."

180 Degrees Restaurant,30,Not worth the price anymore 💔,"I’ve visited 180 degrees during their first year of operation and loved the experience - so we went back with high expectations. Unfortunately I have to give a 3/5 rating because the restaurant has hiked up its prices so much, that it’s not good value for money anymore. I’ll explain why below, but I’d easily give a 4-4,5 star rating if our dinner was half the price, but at 600€ for two ppl (with wines) the food was not worth the money.    Firstly, the lounge is lovely and atmospheric, but we waited for our cocktails for 20 minutes - which were worth the wait as they were amazing. Then we waited a further 20 minutes to get our snacks - at this point quite hungry and tired of waiting. The snacks were divine and led us to expect great things from the dinner! First three courses of the dinner did deliver, but the mains were a bit disappointment. The chicken dish had too many strong competing flavors, while the black angus was not very tender. To me it also seemed that the sauces where the same in the two mains, making the flavor profiles very similar. Dessert was lovely, but the pairing with a white port did not work in our opinion.    One major flaw in the evening and service were the long wait times, and the fact that my friends allergies and dietary restrictions were misunderstood or forgotten multiple times. We sent these to the restaurant almost a week in advance of our booking, but it seemed the comms between floor staff and kitchen was flawed at best."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Perfect dinner,"We didn’t have a table reservation, but luckily there was one no show, so we got a chance to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We’ve been to many fine dining restaurants around the world, and this was one of the best experiences! Great, polite service, very good work considering that waiters were quite young. Starting from the aperitive, ingredients and tastes were top notch class! 4 course meal was a real piece of art. Matthias Dieter was around in the kitchen, and saluted us. Quite special evening."

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,A totally wonderful experience,"Our evening at this restaurant was a memorable experience on many levels. The staff is friendly and attentive, never stuffy and never hovering unnecessarily. Each food course is a work of art. Yes, it is an expensive place, but when you consider the WHOLE experience, it is something worth treating yourself to."

180 Degrees Restaurant,30,A review from a picky Finn :),"First of all, a big thank you to Matthias and his team for good food and a pleasant and joyful experience! You are doing a great job.    Let’s start with the review; I’m not going to dive into details about the food, but I’ll share my general opinion regarding it of course. My focus in this review will be on my experience as a whole and I’ll comment on what I find most important. Very subjective indeed :).    The food was very tasty and good, high quality with only a few remarks. The fish was slightly overcooked and the veal was too much embedded with herbs. Once again, my subjective opinion. All in all, the food kept a high level (especially the first courses were to die for) and the flavours satisfied my taste buds in a very pleasant way.    We got a chance to talk to Matthias himself, both before dinner and after - we appreciated this very much.    Now, let’s move over to the more constructive part of my feedback. For me, when I visit a restaurant (especially a Michelin starred one), I certainly not only focus on the food. I ask myself many times before, during and after the dinner; how do I feel and why? For me, the essential part of a dinner is what my feeling is afterwards, do I urge to make a new booking? I’m sorry to say, but I don’t. I’m going to explain why. Remember now, this was not a bad experience at all, we met professional people that delivered a lot. But unfortunately not the essence for me. The staff were friendly and service minded at some level. Some of the staff really touched us with being authentically there for us.    The general feeling of the level of service is that they are not quite there yet. I’ll list a few things that made me feel a bit concerned. Mostly it’s about communication and the staffs ability to deliver the feeling of being seen and appreciated. My first remark was when the appetizers were served; I missed information about HOW to eat them (in one bite or not), although the other relevant information (ingredients etc.)was in place. This issue followed me during the dinner. We had forks and spoons, but no one told us how we should eat the food to get the most out of the taste. That is important.    Before the first course we were served the wine (we had the cheaper pairing package). Information was that the food will arrive in 3-4 minutes. Well, I think it was 20-30 minutes. And my glass became empty. The situation itself wouldn’t have been a problem since we were not in a hurry, but I would have appreciated if the staff could have communicated with us and told us that there is a delay. Maybe asked if we want some more wine and also just checked if we are okay. We had no clue about the status and we felt quite abandoned at that point.    The wine pairing was good. What I missed was a connection between the wine and the food. Some kind of presentation/story telling regarding how the tastes will be together and what to look after would have been useful. Now we basically got good food and good wine but not ”paired” even if it was.    In the end we got a stressed feeling when we ate the cheese plate, the staff asked if we are ready when we weren’t (they were eager to serve the dessert).    One detail that specifically caught my attention was in the end when we had the petit fours. My company was really full and struggled with finishing the course; I asked for a possibility to take the petit fours as a ”doggy bag”. The response was that ”our boss has a principle that not allows that”. I was surprised. Is there a law in Estonia that hinders this? That is the only acceptable explanation. Otherwise I suggest Matthias to re-think.    I would like to summarize my experience in a short sentence, but I can’t. I need to be specific, mainly because I think the restaurant deserves it. One thing is easy; the quality of the food and the work around it was good. Sometimes very good and even perfect. I didn’t feel a pesonal connection with the staff and therefore my experience overall was not satisfied. Unfortunately. I know that the staff did the best they could, but maybe there should be some educational focus on customer service in the future? When I say that, I mean that the staff needs to be 120% present and the aim should be to be the guests best friend :). That will create a feeling of trust and comfort. It is essential for this kind of experience, otherwise it’s only good food with proper service. In a modern world it is highly important to deliver the feeling, and it needs to be authentic. I know (because we met a couple of them) that you have it in the organisation, you just need to grow the culture.    Once again, thank you Matthias for your engagement and for your great work!"

180 Degrees Restaurant,50,Excellent,Excellent food and service. Cosy atmosphere. We had a seven course dinner menu With a wine package. Definitely recommended!

Trèsind Dubai,50,Delicious experience,"I had the vegetarian chef menu and my father the non-vegetarian, it was amazing. The combination of flavours and its harmony , delicious. Thank you so much"

Trèsind Dubai,50,My Fav Indian Fine dining Restaurant,"It’s a great dining experience. The ambiance is very welcoming . Amazing wines, food and service. Staff are good and make great recommendations."

Trèsind Dubai,50,"Best Indian ever, seriously…","Quite simply one of the best restaurants we’ve ever been to. The food was incredible, the service was amazing - our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly and really helped make our experience. Some dishes are prepared at your table or “live” as it is called on the menu, for example the prawn dish they have as a starter - this is a real treat and the chefs are very engaging and friendly. The price of the food and drink can add up over the course of a meal but it’s so worth it. We will never come to Dubai and not eat here."

Trèsind Dubai,30,If you like Indian food and you want to squander the kids inheritance…this is your place…poor interiors..,For the price charged it’s bordering on Madness.  OK the food was very acceptable but when you stop and think…the setting is like any other Indian restaurant it’s really quite poor…the service is good but the price tag of all this is getting towards utter madness….. give me “world class interiors and creative crockery and glassware and good food” and I’ll pay a hefty price tag but don’t make a fool of me.‼️  Don’t give me cocktails that only fill 1/2 a cocktail glass…..don’t charge me 10 times the price of a regular beer in a cheap glass…and it goes on and on.  The food was good …was it a spectacular even..NO.

Trèsind Dubai,50,Fabulous food,"We went twice during out stay at the one and only Arabian court the first time we had the premium tasting menu the food and service were amazing . The second time we had the al a carte menu this again was fabulous service was excellent food amazing again we were looked after by Abhijeet who recommended food which was brilliant and we probably wouldn’t have chosen , we cant wait to visit again."

Trèsind Dubai,20,Unmet Expectations at a Michelin Star Venue,"Upon venturing to Trèsind Dubai, a Michelin-starred restaurant celebrated for its modernist Indian cuisine situated in the iconic Trade Centre 1 building at the heart of Dubai, I harbored high hopes for a dining experience that would be as splendid as its reputation.    The restaurant's foundation in innovation, leveraging fresh, seasonal ingredients through traditional Indian cooking techniques, promised a culinary journey that was both contemporary and rooted in rich tradition. Moreover, with a menu boasting a wide variety of dishes catering to both vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences, and an extensive wine list featuring selections from around the globe, my expectations naturally soared.    My culinary journey commenced with a notable modernist chaat trolley presentation, a personal chef exhibition at our table that demonstrated culinary theatrics with the application of liquid nitrogen, offering a visual feast alongside delightful tastes. This was an introduction befitting Trèsind Dubai's reputation for innovative dishes.    Sadly, the momentum garnered at the outset did not permeate throughout the entire culinary journey. The chicken tikka served thereafter seemed all too average, unable to invoke a special note that would differentiate it from many others.    As I progressed to the galouti kebab cannoli with accompaniments of pickled onion and mint chutney, I found myself grappling with discordant flavors that did not quite harmonize, resulting in an unsatisfactory taste experience.    Further into the menu, the mixed veg kofta paired with a duet of curries and toasted makhana showed promise but fell short, delivering a kofta that lacked in flavor and curries that did not impress; the green possibly spinach-based curry, and the other reminiscent of a butter chicken sauce were only satisfactory at best.    The traditional butter chicken did not meet the anticipated Michelin standard either, presenting itself with undercooked chicken and an overwhelmingly rich sauce.    While their menu offered a broad selection including vegetarian options, the bread selection that accompanied the dishes was pedestrian, lacking the unique touch that would have elevated the dining experience.    On a high note, the sweet gesture of candyfloss at the end of the meal was a delightful touch, evoking a sense of whimsy and joy, briefly lifting the experience.    In terms of service, I expected a more engaging and attentive approach, especially considering the establishment’s reputation and the availability of a private dining room for an intimate dining experience. The service seemed somewhat detached, lacking proactive engagement to enhance our dining experience with insightful details about the rich and innovative offerings.    To conclude, while Trèsind Dubai certainly offered moments of delight with innovative approaches to Indian cuisine and boasts a facility capable of hosting both grand and intimate dining experiences, it did not consistently meet the Michelin standard that one would expect from such a well-regarded establishment. The experience, unfortunately, hovered more around a 2/5, a rating salvaged primarily by the chaat trolley and the enchanting candyfloss gesture."

Trèsind Dubai,20,Tresind - executive lunch - Not worth!! Too much hidden cost.,"Executive lunch has good taste starters, but with the tiny 3 little so called starters. Main course, very average tasting food. Plus most disappointing is ordering water. Water small bottle is charged at AED 40. 2 ppl you pay AED 80… wow! Overall you end up paying like crazy ! So pls be careful ordering anything outside the set lunch. Was absolutely disappointed experience."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Fine Indian dining,"This place my wife booked for birthday celebrations and I was completely blown away by the small details from the staff to the main person Mr Praful, absolutely fantastic soon as we got out the car the hotel staff gave us a guide to the restaurant then the restaurant staff took over and took us to our table. We ordered the chaat and chicken tikka starter which was out of this world the taste in the mouth is unexplainable. Then we got butter chicken and lamb curry bonsho I think they were both truly out this world with the taste in the mouth and the way it was made. Thank you very much for the deserts and the candy floss paan. The Jasmin tea experience is a good one. Thank you again to everyone and especially to Mr Praful for the service and hospitality, I will be coming back in the future.  Thanks  Mr Haq"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Unique Indian Taste,Food is good and unique. Quantities are small for the price they charge irrespective of the quality and brand they carry. I would visit again. My daughter love this place

Trèsind Dubai,50,A Superb Indian Dining Experience,"A superb meal - wonderful dishes, bursting with flavours, expertly presented in a stylish and modern environment.    The team there were helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and extremely proud of the food they served - and so they should be.    I will definitely return."

Trèsind Dubai,50,"Experience at Trèsind, Dubai","We had a fantastic experience here! The food and service were amongst the best on offer in Dubai. An example of some things we ate were Chaat, Paneer Pinwheel, Naan and Pani Puri. All the dishes were delectable and the service was also great. The waiters were efficient and very helpful. We were served by Snehit who was a really great host. Bhim was the manager who did a great job and everything ran smoothly. One unique aspect of our experience was that some items were prepared in front of us, unusual for Indian cuisine but used to great effect here!"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Our new favourite local in Dubai - visit this restaurant - its a must if you like hospitality and gastronomy,Walked in on the last day of our stay in One and Only Royal Mirage for a quick lunch but wish we had walked in the day of our arrival: Most friendly staff and amazing flavours with a very knowledgeable sommelier. We just went in for a quick lunch in our beach outfit but will be back for supper soon!

Trèsind Dubai,10,Found hair in my food,HAIR IN MY FOOD! Had gone to Tresind last week for their lunch set menu since I had guests who flew in from Nepal .The whole reason of taking them to Tresind was for them to have one of a kind experience with their food and to our disappointment there was a strand of hair tangled in the gravy of the chicken!  When we brought it to the knowledge of the manager they were certainly apologetic gave us a mocktail on the house and gave an 18 percent discount on the total bill . They asked me if I was a regular at Tresind and I said yes and their defence was that has it ever happened before ma’am ? This is just a one time incident . My review here is to voice that it SHOULD NOT have happened even once. Tresind studio is rated as no.2 on the 50 best restaurants in MENA region which does not do justice to the experience we had there . So my suggestion to anyone who goes to this restaurant is to watch out what your are eating.It was an unacceptable sour experience for me and more than that embarrassing to say the least in front of my guests. I definitely have my reservations of visiting the restaurant again!

Trèsind Dubai,50,Amazing Food and Stellar Service,"Stellar Experience.    Not only is the new location more appropriate for the brand but uplifts the entire experience    The food has always been 5* the service I would rate beyond that, if that be a thing.    All in all an amazing afternoon experience, special shout-out to Praful for making the afternoon memorable with his attention and the sweet surprise."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Great experience. I highly recommend it!,"The food presentation was excellent, with each dish thoughtfully presented, showcasing the preparation process. It added to the overall dining experience and made it truly enjoyable. I had a special request for an event, and I was impressed by how the restaurant hostesses Misses (Sezal & Rita) followed up and paid attention to every detail. The food itself was delicious, offering a wide range of options to choose from. The manager Mr (Bein) made sure we were constantly satisfied, and the waiter Mr. (Snehit) provided informative insights about the dishes. Highly recommended!"

Trèsind Dubai,50,One of the Best Indian restaurants in dubai,The food is great the place is amazing love the chaat also the salad was so yummy their juice was so refreshing love everything about this Indian restaurant

Trèsind Dubai,50,Great experience,It was a fantastic experience and our waiter was so professional his name is RajPal. The food and atmosphere was great. Definitely will b visiting again.

Trèsind Dubai,50,A Fiesta of Flavours,"The day my close friend revealed her plans to relocate from Dubai, my other friend and I wished to spend some quality time to leave us all with memories that would be etched in our heart and mind forever. We decided to lunch at Tresind, One and Only Royal Mirage and it turned out to be a wise choice indeed!  We were greeted with warm and welcoming smiles by the Manager and his proficient team, who showed us to our table. Thus began our journey of exquisite fine dining, accentuated with warm vibes and chic food presentation. What caught our fancy was not only the ambrosial flavors, but also the sweet story behind each dish, that was unfolded with divine passion.    Each course, each dish was distinctive. The amuse-bouche, missi roti with spiced butter was heavenly. The Arugula Panipuri was served in cute little earthen pots, with intricate butterflies perched atop the puris!  As they say, well begun is half done! This course stirred our curiosity as we waited excitedly to discover more creative endeavors from the Chef.    The starters followed next- each dish a class of its own-spinach kebabs, dahi kebabs and avocado kebabs were served elegantly and presented fashionably.    The palate cleanser, a white chocolate and black lime bon bon was a treat in itself, while it prepared us for our onward journey, it left a refreshing aftertaste too.    The main course came in next as we continued on our tantalizing journey of delightful dishes. The resplendent flavor of achari chana, paneer pinwheel , the black dal kare - raisu and the breads, further elevated our dining experience.    The paan flavored cotton candy and filter coffee cornetto were a mesmerizing melange of the old and the new!! The desserts certainly weaved magic and were a perfect fit to draw a close to our magical journey.    Indian food and dining experience can’t get better!!!    It’s only fair to end with a special note of gratitude to the Chef, Mr. Himanshu Saini, the Manager Mr Prafful and the entire team for curating memorable experiences for guests that craft memories sure to last a lifetime!"

Trèsind Dubai,40,Business lunch,We did the business lunch and it was very good. Starters were superb. Chicken breast on the bone with a spicy curry sauce was epic. The little lamb wrap/burger was also very original and yummy. Main was a trio of curriers which was a bit standard. Dessert was fabulous. Cool place. Well worth a visit.

Trèsind Dubai,50,Highly recommended,"What a great place! I highly recommend, everything was an amazing- food, service, vibe. It was our engagement dinner and the restaurant prepared for us gift - delicious dessert. We were pleasantly surprised. And the most important was our waiter - Snehit Kadam! You are the best, a person with passion for what he does. Thank you Snehit!"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Best Indian Restaurant in Dubai,"Trisend Studio :Best Indian Restaurant in Dubai. We visited for dinner recently and it was lovely ammazing delicious food  We enjoyed the dinner with creative presentation on the table. It was a memorable experience. All the staff are friendly and having great knowledge and experience about the product and service.  We recommend to must visit Tresend Indian restaurant for Luxurious experience.  Very good location, surrounded by beautiful garden and easy access from hotel too. BRAVO"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Great Location and amazing food,Love this place. Great prepared food and excellent choices. Elegant interior and very attentive staff. Don’t miss this in Dubai

Trèsind Dubai,10,Tasty but very Disappointed,Tasty food but the qua tory was so low and disappointing. In the name of started they gave only one single shrimp salad.. Not a single filling starter. In main course there was one paratha crisp along with bite seized portions of 3 Gravis. This is extremely small and had to get up with empty stomach after paying around 120$ for a single person. Extremely disappointed

Trèsind Dubai,50,Excellent Indian fusion food,"Good place with fusion Indian food, variety with excellant taste and finest environment with high class location"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Loved It!,One of the finest Indian meals i have ever had. Great menu and many dishes are cooked at your table. Very attractive inside the restaurant and a nice ambience. Very friendly helpful staff and you are also served extras in between courses. Fully Recoomended.

Trèsind Dubai,50,Wow !,"Had a lovely meal and evening at Tresind. Made to feel very welcomed by all the staff - food choice and quality of the highest order .    Presentation of the dishes ,with some prepared at your table brought the whole meal to life . Real theatre !    Would definitely recommend and also booking a table well in advance as very popular."

Trèsind Dubai,10,"What theatre, but the performance was way below standard","We thought we would try Tresind having taken over the reliable Nina, which we had been to for many years.  We decided to take the Tasting menu.  It took ages to place a simple order ( the restaurant was not full), then the theatre started, not understanding the performers as they acted out their crazy deliverance of the food. Well, the portions were minute and lacked real differentiation between dishes.  Then as the scene changes took place, we waited and waited for the next act, some 30 to 40 minutes and another theatrical performance with very poor actors…….  After a complaint, the Manager did apologise and provided a bill which was also incorrect and extortionate..  So, a very bad experience of food, service and ambience."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Brilliant food and service and expressive,"Superb staff, superb food and ambiance. Highly recommended. Takes modern Indian cuisine to a different new high"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Mastering Indian cuisine,"Food was rich in details and shadows, service was able to explain each particular served.  Ingredients were blended perfectly to create a balanced and harmonic feeling.  Well deserved the success that it’s getting known for  Try the degustation you won’t regret"

Trèsind Dubai,10,Food very good Service abysmal,"Didnt like the table we were given and asked to be moved. They said nothing else available. Very dismissive. Food was good but service was awful. Loads of tables with good views available all night but we were not offered one although we had said we did not like the table we were given (in a small room off the main restau  rant and we had booked with 4 weeks notice) Waited AGES to be served and our starters were served within 20 mins of each other so we ate seperately  . We wont return. Definately letting down a wonderful Hotel.. Dined Feb 0203  ,"

Trèsind Dubai,40,Modern Indian cuisine,"One&Only Royal Mirage, Arabian Court - Dubai Marina - this is an contemporary Indian restaurant with quality food and services .  Sophisticated Indian restaurant spotlighting adventurous entrees & desserts,  Price range is quite higher but good experience."

Trèsind Dubai,50,A delightful experience with Gitesh and Sohit,"I visited Tresind a couple of days ago with my friend and am still in the aura of one of the best Indian contemporary food experiences that i have ever witnessed.    Very impressed with the food,service, interiors and the excellent staff.    Menu is designed with the aesthetics of not loosing the Indian touch from the food and yet made it presentable in a sophisticated contemporary style. Each dish had its own unique taste which literally took our tastebuds to another level. My personal favourites were rasam soup,mushroom soup,pickle flavoured butter, and the chicken tandoori starter.    Excellent service by Mr. Sohit who made sure to give us detailed explanation about each dish while serving and gave us a personalised tour to this lavish course. He was all smiles throughout the evening just how a perfect hospitality professional should be.    Special thanks to Mr.Gitesh for overlooking our meal and comfort throughout the evening who made this experience delightful and very special.    Would definitely recommend the place to my friends and will be back soon with my family to explore their tastebuds at the world class restaurant.    It was a flavorful, delicious and delightful experience.    Thank you Team Tresind."

Trèsind Dubai,40,"Good food , service and atmosphere",This is a relatively new addition to the One & Only where we were staying. This is a privately owned restaurant so outside the half board standard offer but it is certainly worth trying.  This is contemporary Indian with quality food and service. You can understand why it was recognised by Michelin.  We are off the Al La carte menu although we could see plenty of diners enjoying the tasting menu. Whilst they were busy we never felt rushed nor had to wait long between courses.  It is not a cheap option but I am certainly glad we experienced Tresind.  It was busy so I would recommend you book ahead. We booked ahead of leaving the UK via the hotel.  Recommended

Trèsind Dubai,10,Poor,"Nice food, but very sloooow and poor service. Add water - self service. When you order a special set menu, you shouldn’t wait up to 30 (!) mins after finish with a previous dish. Isn’t it?… 💁‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ maybe it’s just in case that we pay two weeks prior this day."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Well deserved Michelin star,"What an experience. A beautiful setting in the One & Only Royal Mirage with the best service I have ever experienced in a restaurant anywhere. And the food was to die for - Portobello Tandoor, Chicken Chettinad, cedar wood smoked chicken and the tandoori lamb chops were especially amazing. The live table side cooking was quirky and a great treat. Fantastic, loved everything about this place and totally understand why it has a Michelin star."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Superb Asian meal with family,"We were curious to hear that Ninas was no longer, at the Arabian Court at the O&O, after having many beautiful meals there over the years so we booked to see how the new place would compare. To be fair we were blown away at how amazing the new setting has nestled nicely into this spot. The cuisine was amazing and once the service has had time to settle a little, I think this place will be outstanding. Look forward to our next visit when we come to Dubai."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Once again top notch,"This consistently amazing restaurant venue of the city has moved after all these years from Voco Hotel to the One and Only. And very well they did. The new setting is wonderful. Sick and aristocratic, spacey and elegant. The service was top as always. But what is amazing really is the consistency of the food quality. All the great flavors that made that restaurant a myth are there, enhanced with some new ones. Soon as I am concerned I believe that this team deserves a great bravo. I will always be a loyal client of theirs and recommended with absolutely no hesitation. As a paradigm of their excellence I want to publish the photo of their amuse Bouche, a pouri bhaji inspired creation. The bottom is a mini clay pot filled with the liquid you should pour in the bhaji. I consider this by far the best amuse Bouche served in Dubai this year and it matches everything else on the menu, which in general is full of meticulously prepared ultra tasty creations."

Trèsind Dubai,40,A great experience in Indian fusion cuisine,"A great experience to witness some live cooking and to try some exciting fusion Indian cuisine to the enjoyment of the entire group of friends… it was amazing to watch 2 live cooking demonstrations and each dish that was ordered was presented beautifully as well just the right taste & spice.  The decor is simple and enough seating all over, reservations are required for any disappointments. Service is professional as each waiter knew exactly what was in each dish. Overall a very satisfying visit & full to the brim."

Trèsind Dubai,50,Best Indian Food,This is the mother of the group and I love the place. Tresind brought Indian Food to another level in Dubai

Trèsind Dubai,50,Perfect,"Amazing food! Amazing experience, good service and amazing food. Would definetly come back. Recomend"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Indian Fine Dining at its Best!,"We enjoyed the lunch set menu, from start to finish it was absolutely delicious!! The presentation was lovely and the service impeccable."

Trèsind Dubai,50,WOW ... best experience,One of the best culinary experiences I have ever enjoyed in Dubai!    We chose the Chief's Menu and were pleasantly surprised with every course. Many of the exciting courses were prepared directly at the table and were all of the highest quality and creativity.    Price / performance is simply TOP. We will definitely be back. Thank you to the entire team for this great evening we had.

Trèsind Dubai,50,Best Indian Restaraunt,An amazing restaurant that does such a creative spin on dishes. Really veggie friendly too. The pumpkin soup is amazing!

Trèsind Dubai,40,Mr,"Worth visiting.. we enjoyed the food , Food is delicious and good service quality by staff  Kids like cotton candy 😃"

Trèsind Dubai,50,Masterfully crafted tasting menu,"Tried the 11-course non-vegetarian tasting menu in Trèsind.    Great service from Abhijeet. He was very pleasant to talk to throughout the meal.    Arugula pani puri  Great concept. Refreshing, crispy, slightly spicy. A very strong first impression.    Missi roti, green chili butter  Less impressive. Roti felt a little bit dense. Works well with the butter.    Chaat  Great table side service. Chaat had a balanced flavour profile and was nicely presented.    Mushroom chai  Delicious consommé, savoury dehydrated mushroom slices, excellent fragrance from truffle milk powder. Brilliant touch in presentation.    Tandoori rosemary lamb chop  Slightly overcooked and also evenly cooked. Partially medium and partially medium well. Intention was medium? Potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Simple but beautiful use of green purée for plating. Another great table side service of chimichurri. Freshness of the sauce compliments both hot appetisers well.    Tandoori tiger prawn, amritsari soft shell crab  Outstanding dish. Such an impactful tandoori flavour from the prawns. Smokiness, grill flavour, cooked to perfection.    Yuzu and blueberry sorbet  Amazing. I am not a fan of sorbet at all. But this sorbet had yuzu pulps inside. It has a slightly sandy texture, instead of that ordinary sorbet texture. Very pleasant palate cleanser.    Prawn curry, lamb and coconut stew, chicken chettinad  Amazing flavours. Make sure you start with the lamb stew, then the prawn curry, and chicken chettinad last. Lamb stew: smooth, rich but not heavy. Prawn curry: creamy, slightly spicy, juicy prawns. Chicken chettinad: great flavours blended altogether, delectable.    Khichdi  I was worried after seeing so many ingredients added in the stew, but they blend very well together. With the yogurt, it’s delicious. Great proof of concept by using so many regional ingredients.    Black Forest mithal cake  Another table side service. The building of the dessert was entertaining enough, but the taste was not well balanced to me. The plate had complexity but maybe too much complexity, compromising the overall flavour. Nothing memorable about the dessert other than “sweet”.    Paan cotton candy  Interesting paan flavour. Lovely presentation.    Overall an outstanding tasting menu. Generous portion size, all 11 dishes were up to mark with excellent appetisers and main courses. Menu lost a little bit of momentum when it came to first dessert. Very intense table side service, it takes a well-disciplined team to coordinate a set menu like this. Service was near perfect. Brilliant combination of modern gastronomy techniques and respect for authentic cooking."

Alleno Paris,50,Amazing and worth the planning to get in.,Lived up to the hype. Amazing venue. Great pace of meal. No dead spaces. Staff and sommelier was fantastic. Great menu with some chances and they paid off. A meal to remember during an amazing trip. We experienced the Three Michelin stars.

Alleno Paris,50,Charming restaurant - perfect for a dinner date,"We love delicious and beautiful food and this is what you get at Alleno. We noticed though that the chef used gel on many of the meals. It might have been the theme but we didn’t quite enjoy it except for the salad. Service is excellent; our server was attentive but alas, forgot to send the candles used our celebratory dessert. The dining room is exquisitely charming - Perfect for our dinner date. Great to experience dining here only once."

Alleno Paris,50,"Not just a meal, but an unforgettable experience","This is my first time writing a restaurant review on this or any other site. With three young children I usually just don't have enough hours in the day. But after enjoying a meal of a lifetime at Alleno Paris, I owe it to the fabulous team of professionals there to make time and shout their praises from the mountaintops.    The food was sublime and absolutely worthy of every one of Alleno's three Michelin stars. Each of the nine courses of the tasting menu delighted, intrigued and satisfied our palates. Every mouthful was a study in contrasting textures, consistencies and tastes. Half my time was spent guessing what ingredient was responsible for the delicious burst of flavor of my previous bite.    Yet as great as the food was, I want foremost to highlight the amazing hospitality and service my family received from the team. This was my kids' first trip to Paris. My oldest son (10 y old) is obsessed with all things food, and studies the Michelin guide in his free time. I wanted to provide him with the experience of a lifetime -- to dine at one of the finest restaurants in the food capital of the world.    Having brought my kids to Michelin restaurants before, I was certain all three would behave appropriately. The biggest question heading in was whether this venerable institution would even give me the chance.    Not only were they warm, kind and welcoming to my family (as were all Parisians this trip) from the very first moment, they positively rolled out the red carpet by: creating a special menu for my youngest (4 y old) and giving him coloring books as entertainment, taking my older children for a tour of the three restaurants occupying the historical Ledoyen space, introducing them to the entire kitchen staff, providing all of us with personalized menus inside of envelopes as keepsakes.    I cannot emphasize how much this dinner exceeded my wildest hopes and expectations. A meal became an unforgettable life experience for this family. In return, I can only humbly offer our loyal patronage each time we are back in this great city.    Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Team Alleno."

Alleno Paris,50,Exceptional,"Alleno is an exceptional dining experience with impeccable service, an impressive wine list, and exquisitely crafted dishes that tantilize the taste buds. The restaurant's elegant decor and ambience make for a truly memorable evening."

Alleno Paris,50,Foodie Heaven!,"My wife and I celebrated our 20yr anniversary here while we were in Paris. It was so amazing! Our first 3 Michelin star experience, and they did not disappoint. The service was the excellent and the staff helped us understand the methods used to create the unique flavors/dishes. The wine pairing was wonderful and the food over the top. The Wagyu and portobello was one of the most unique and delicious dishes we’ve ever had. A wonderful experience from hello to goodbye."

Alleno Paris,10,A huge dissapointment,"We were really excited about dining here, being a 3 stat restaurant. We are food enthusiasts and always book a michelin star restaurant during our trips abroad. But this was by far the worst we tried. The service is great but the food is below average. 10/12 courses were tasteless, one simply unedible. The wine pairing could have saved the day but the food was just too bad."

Alleno Paris,10,Worst michelin star restaurant ever. Total ripoff. Avoid at all costs,"We were a group of 4 friends, 2 couples. We had the whole experience, 12 courses with wine pairing.    The wagyu was very good and the raviolo was good, all the others were sub par, below average.    We payed 5000 euros for a below average meal, which is a total ripoff.    I simply cannot explain why this awful restaurant even has michelin stars.    I spoke with the chef and he said that he eas sorry, but he looked more like a young kebab cooker.    Worst experience ever, avoid at all costs"

Alleno Paris,50,Great experience,"Although we were expecting it, everything was excellent. Starting with the setting, the service and finishing with the great food!"

Alleno Paris,50,Doesn’t Get Better Than This,"This beautiful Michelin three-star restaurant has earned all of its kudos. The experience started about a week before the actual dinner, as I was contacted via phone by one of the staff to discuss our preferences in detail. This affable young man was also part of the large crew, all as friendly as they were knowledgeable, who served us. Since we arrived a few minutes early, we were taken on a tour of the kitchen meeting all of the chefs and culinary staff, and then of the restaurant and the entire facility. It was already a wonderful experience - and we hadn’t yet sat down to dinner in the lovely dining room. We each went with a tasting menu. Each course was exquisite, a delicate balance of flavors. Highlights were the fresh fish and the spectacular desserts. Obviously this isn’t inexpensive, but we found Alleno well worth it."

Alleno Paris,50,Outstanding experience,"Outstanding service, outstading food, outstanding wine list, outstanding ambience. Perfect combination of french cuisine and innovation."

Alleno Paris,50,Simply outstanding and redefining 3 star dining experience,"Wow. This is probably the most important fine dining restaurant to visit right now. The chef and his team deliver a simply flawless performance. This begins before you even arrive to the restaurant with a phone call from one of the restaurant's managers to check on preferences, special occasion etc. Basically 5 minutes to ensure the highest level of personalization. Of course there are very few places that offer Ledoyen's sense of arrival and such a beautiful historic room. And then you sit down. First comes the amazing grower champagne and gone are the canapes. Instead come two amazing amuse bouche prepared table side. Once of them fancy: caviar, cream etc and the other as simple as can be: a little bread, a little sauce to be eaten with your fingers. Wow!    And then comes a succession of dishes, one more amazing than the other. Like watching a ballet between the kitchen and servers. Unbelievable. The hardest part was deciding which main course to select...so we selected 3 for the two of us and each was simply outstanding.    Highlights for us were the white truffle and egg,, langoustine, turbot on this gorgeous bed of garlic and veal sweetbreads.    Both chefs (Yannick and Martino) visited the tables multiple times which is awesome and unusual. These are real chefs who work in their kitchens every day and it's refreshing to see.    All in all, i really tried hard to find a single fault...but i could not. If you are looking to catch a glimpse of what 3 star Michelin experience should be/could be or if you are just looking for a magical night out then you should not miss Alleno. Prepare to be blown away."

Alleno Paris,20,Not worth the hype at all !,"Pretty deceptive. Recommended by friends and must admit that nothing is worth the price and the quantity. Maybe the chef yelling on his team like a pretentious guy is the only interesting thing in this restaurant. I Had the image of a vulgar person when it was coming to the chef of this place : well, it’s confirmed."

Alleno Paris,50,Very Classy place,"I loved the food, it was yummy and nicely presented. The service is very efficient and friendly, it is worth every euro!!!"

Alleno Paris,50,The classiest meal ever,"The room is awe-inspiring. The service is magnificent. The food is on another level. I was utterly amazed by this meal. The only fault was the dessert was not as good as the mains and starters, but nothing could take away from the overall experience. I was most impressed by how you can get any (absolutely ANY!!) wine by the half-bottle. However, I was impressed by everything - worthy of three ++++ stars."

Alleno Paris,50,Amazing!,Just incredible! Everything was perfect! I am a gastronomic fan and tried many star Michelin restaurants over the par yearsa... this one was by far the Best! Thank you Mr Alleno for this amazing dinner!

Alleno Paris,50,A Star for each hour!,"What a magnificent time. For people who don't care for extravagance and what Michelin ratings can do there are plenty of other places. However, if you love to live it up, get exquisite food and service and are confident enough to have a good time then this is a must.  We were there eating and drinking for 5 hours. Our server and the Somme were personable and charming and giving. At no time did our experience feel stuffy or certainly not rushed. The flavors were amazing and the the size of the courses were such that by the end of the night while we'd had enough we didn't feel like we had too much. The courses were presented as dyads - a fish a certain way matched with another way and so on.  The weather was beautiful and we walked the streets of Paris after for a perfect night."

Alleno Paris,50,In my memory for ever !!!,My lovely wife decided for my sixtieth anniversary to book a private dinning room in this spectacular building with family and friends. Nothing to say...…. all was perfect and the food was really amazing. We have been lucky enough to dring our Dom P before dinner in the 3 stars kitchen with the Chef and his brigade. One of the best dinner of my life !

Alleno Paris,50,A tour de force.,"A tour de force. Although the restaurant does not have a bar, we arrived a bit early and the sommelier happily took an order for a glass of Montrachet while we waited for the dining room to open. Soon we were escorted to the second floor dining room, dimly lit overlooking the Champs Elysee, a marvelous nighttime view during the Holidays, with red and white lights adorning the trees along the Champs. Service for the evening (with one exception) was among the best we had in Paris. In fact the “choreography” of the staff surrounding a table to present a food course, not speaking but simply looking and gesturing, was almost magical to behold. Each food course seemed more imaginative, building to a crescendo with deserts. Our only disappointment was the inattentiveness to bringing our check. We explained that we had an early morning flight and wished to depart. But the server simply kept doing other things rather than bringing us our check. Once the manager realized the problem, he recovered well and quickly. Still a wonderful evening on our last night in Paris."

Alleno Paris,50,Fabulous meal. Slightly,"Fabulous meal.  Slightly odd arrival. We arrived 1910 for 1930 booking. Put in an indifferent waiting room.  Taken to dining room - superb. All very unhurried.  Wine unusual. My wife and I like half bottles. There were no half bottles. They said choose what we fancy and they charge half price and sell the left overs by the glass. Fantastic!  Starter was prawn thing covered by Oscietra caviar with half of that covered by 1g of gold leaf (excellent for your complexion we were told by our charming waitress).  Main course stunning hare - carved theatrically at the table.  Dessert - I have no recollection but it was good!  With dessert I had a flight of Château d’Yquem - 1985, 2006 and 2016. What an experience.  We were then taken to the kitchen to meet the chefs.  Overall, a wonderful meal in a fabulous setting.  Frighteningly expensive but worth it."

Alleno Paris,50,Amazing business dinner!!,"Perhaps the best business dinner I’ve ever had. Spectacular food, service. A memorable experience with really unique touchiest"

Alleno Paris,50,Fantastic food. Fantastic staff,"My daughter ate her and the staff could not have been more kind and understanding. I had booked the wrong date so of course they did not have our reservation. They were kind enough to fit us in and it was perfect as they needed the table and we were able to eat rather quickly. The food was obviously amazing. What really stood out was how kind and understanding they were, not only of my mistake in booking but with my 10 year old and being extremely kind in what one would assume could be a very stuffy environment, which was as far from true as possible. Yes it’s expensive, but when I got a look at the kitchen I understood why. There are as many staff as guests. I swear there were 20 people in the kitchen and another 20:waitstaff. There are only 14 tables with mostly couples so you so the math.  We shared the tasting menu (12 courses 450 euro) and it was amazing. If it seems too expensive you don’t have the money or you don’t love food enough to spend the money and you should go somewhere else."

Alleno Paris,50,30 years wedding anniversary,"Chef Alleno came to welcome us as he did for all his guests.  The place, setting, all of the staff made the dining memorable.  We had the tasting menu and wine pairing. The combination was outstanding. The creativity of his dishes explains why he has three stars Michelin award."

Alleno Paris,50,One of the best in Paris,"We had the pleasure to dine at Ledoyen in June with few friends. It was my third time to dine at this amazing restaurant. It is one of my favorite restaurant in the world. The decor, service, wine list, and food are all incredible. I especially love the caviar Langustine tart. It is amazing! I can’t wait to come back and recommend it to anyone who is visiting Paris!"

Alleno Paris,50,Truffle Heaven at Ledoyen,"Dined here with my husband last December and had a magnificent experience. He tried the truffle based tasting menu while I just sampled two courses, a pasta and a salad. The food was so beautiful while the staff was incredibly hospitable. For the truffle tasting, the staff placed my husband's personal truffle in a beautiful glass case (almost looked like the rose from Beauty and the Beast). It was over the top but so perfect. Exactly what we wanted from a decadent night out in Paris."

Alleno Paris,50,A Magic Moment at Ledoyen !,"Nothing is better than spending a Romantic WE in Paris, and even more if you couple it with a fantastic dinner at Ledoyen !  The magic of this 19th Century Pavillon in such a quiet environment when it is only 5mns from the Champs Elysées and Le Grand Palais transports you in the Paris Belle Époque.  The staff is super considerate, always present to make this moment an unforgettable experience though discreet to respect your privacy.  We loved the menu from the amused bouche till the desert. Everything was exquisite and particularly the Blanc manger d’amande, the White Asparagus a la vanille et au titchi.  I still have the taste of the mille feuille de waguy au champignon de paris which is among the best thing I ever ate without mentioning the fine tarte aux fraises floral !  The wine pairing that the sommelier recommended us was exceptional and paired so well with the menu.  Chef Yannick Alleno came many times in the room and was genuinely happy to spend time with his clients. It is such a pleasure to discuss with a chef that is so talented and accessible in the same time.  We can’t wait that we return to Paris to experience it again !!!"

Alleno Paris,10,An Embarrassment and Appalling Disappointment,"We looked forward to experiencing the tasting menu as a celebration of our 20th anniversary. We have been to 1,2 and 3 Star Michelin restaurants across Europe and we have never been anything but amazed and thrilled with our experiences and every time we felt the cost was justified. THIS EXPERIENCE WAS A JOKE. Besides the amuse-bouche, the following 7 course each disappointed more than the one prior. Unimaginative, bland, sloppy, uninspired, —-our first two courses were virtually inedible and literally swimming in what the server described as non egg mayonnaise....just because it didn’t have eggs doesn’t mean we want two courses in a row swimming in what tastes like mayo. We have been to so many other Michelin tasting menus and this is not even remotely close to a 1 star! The staff was careless, inattentive, and behaved as through they were overwhelmed and totally unprofessional. We had to literally WAVE our hands in the air to get our check at the end of the evening because after being ignored for 20 minutes we put our card on the table as a hint and were ignored for another 10 minutes.    Oh! And although we were assured our tasting menu included a cheese course (we clarified this because it is always a highlight for us esp in France), which we started to really look forward to after we picked at the bland, boring courses.....it was never presented to us or even offfered! I couldn’t believe our meal concluded and all dishes were cleared with no additional mention or offer of the cheese course. I was too embarrassed to ask for it or to point out it was forgotten. But what an additional insult and indication of just how disorganized and poor the service was.    All in we paid e1500 for this meal (with e55 pp glass of champagne, a TINY and insulting pour of a glass of e35 white which the server suggested we add to taste the first courses, in addition to a pricey bottle of red). We were disgusted by the waste when we could have gone back to somewhere like Guy Savoy where we had the type of experience you would expect from a even a minimum 1 Star.    Michelin- you need to get back here pronto- you are detracting from your brand by allowing this below mediocre overpriced uninspired and unprofessional establishment to be associated with Michelin."

Alleno Paris,50,Award Winning Dessert,"I ate at Yannick Alleno at Pavilion Ledoyen on May 2nd. As part of the same trip, I also ate at L'Epicure and Le Cinq in Paris and ABaC in Barcelona, all being Michelin 3 star restaurants, and at Abantal in Seville (one Michelin star) and at Santceloni in Madrid (2 Michelin stars). Of all of the restaurants, the dessert at Ledoyen was the best. The description of the dessert on the menu--""coffee flavored fir tree extraction jelly, spiced chocolate flakes and warm creamy chocolate""--does not adequately convey the depth of tastes, and ""licking"" certain of the ingredients off of the back of my hand to start the dessert was, needless to say, a first for me. The dessert recently won an award as the best ""coffee dessert"" in Paris and its environs. The crab appetizer and the main course of poached white turbot flavored with orange blossom were both excellent. I was a bit surprised that the family seated next to me included a two or (at most) three year old boy, but he was generally well-behaved, despite ""getting up"" from his seat and walking around the table more than once."

Alleno Paris,50,Sublime - Divine - Culinary perfection,"The experience crafted by Yannick Allenot and his team is simply sublime. Every dish is perfect and so is every facet of service, the selection of wines, the ambiance. Don't miss a visit to L'Abysse for some exceptional Japanese cuisine by YA."

Alleno Paris,50,Exceptional meal,Gorgeous and detailed interior setting with lots of natural light during lunch service. Beautiful presentations and plating. Skip the lunch menu and go a la carte as the higher end items really shine and showcase the chef’s talents. Had the most deliciously prepared lobster here. Yannick Alleno was present and nice enough to take a few photos with the guests.    Only quibble would be consistency of service with staff. Some staff were exceptionally courteous and professional while others seemed aloof. The wine list wasn’t as expansive as I hoped. But these things were minor and did not take away the great experience one seeks at an establishment like this.

Alleno Paris,50,Magical,"This is the first time I have ever spent 800 euros on dinner for two. It is not my first three star restaurant, by any means, but it is my first in ten or fifteen years. Hence the sticker shock. Seeing wines, for example, that I know are available for sale in the liquor store for 30 euros on offer for 250 euros took me aback. Similarly, a glass of normal champagne (Moet, not Dom Perignon) for 60 euros? Perhaps I could live with appetizers at 60 euros each, and main courses at 160 euros each, especially if I meditated a bit, but the 800% markups on normal things hurt my sense of proportion.    I also was a little put off by the mystery of the restaurant name. It appears to have been known for years as Pavilion Ledoyen, and that’s how everyone I spoke to referred to it. It is advertised as Alleno at Pavilion Ledoyen, and the carte at the end of the meal just said Alleno Paris. I understand the branding of a renowned chef. However, I think that you have to pick a name.    Having put my only two complaints up front, everything else about this restaurant was as good as you could imagine. We were looking for the ultimate fine dining experience, and we got it.    The restaurant is set near the Place Concorde end of the Champs Elysees, and has a view of the park and the museum there. The rooms are open and quiet, with large tables set very far apart for comfort and atmosphere, and high ceilings. The décor is beautiful. The staff are on point, knowledgeable, and very friendly. At no time did any of them seem rushed, in part because there were lots of them.    Step one in this experience is an aperitif cart, where you can choose various champagnes, digestifs, etc. A lovely amuse bouches follows, too light to fill you up, but getting your taste buds ready for a real adventure.    We had appetizers (entrees) that included the Soupe improbable de poisson, or “unexpected fish soup”. It starts off as a very good fish soup, but then just as you think you are finished, they have a second part to it. I won’t spoil the surprise, but it’s quite good. The other appetizer, oeuf en ravioli, was equally good.    Then we moved to the main course, lobster for one and poularde Tauzin for the other. Presentation is of the sort you want to take photos, because otherwise no-one will believe it. It is not a lot of food, of course, but each bite has exactly the flavours you would have hoped for.    Add to this combination of flavours a good bottle of Sancerre, and the experience was certainly what we wanted. Paced over two and a half hours, to ensure that we could enjoy every taste, we felt at the end like we now knew what really fine dining is all about.    I have been to Tour d’Argent, and Taillevent, as well as Le Mercure and other really good restaurants, in Paris and elsewhere. There is a reason why Pavilion Ledoyen has three Michelin stars. It earns them with the great dining experience offered."

Alleno Paris,50,Simply Divine,"We had lunch at Ledoyen a few days ago and were simply blown away. The fin de siecle pavillion set in a blooming park with the Petit Palais just across is already an experience, the service and the food are just divine, nourishments for the gods, nectar and ambrosia. I would be a regular if I lived in Paris, because everything about the Lesoyen made me glad. Thank you for the little tour of the kitchen at the end of our lunch. We could not have had a better time."

Alleno Paris,10,Don't waste your time or money,"I have never felt so unwelcome or offended in a restaurant. We spent the week in Paris and ate at Pur, Fauchon, Taillevent and Carré des Feuillants. We have onion and garlic allergies and were very open and forthcoming about these allergies when making the reservations. Also, this trip was a celebration or our 30 years of marriage. As such, we were looking for special meals and special memories. We had recently received a couple bottles of 1985 Chateaux Margaux from a family member and wanted to enjoy a bottle with our meal. We had our hotel make the reservation at Le Doyen and had told them both about our allergies and about our special bottle of wine. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were seated and asked to speak with the sommelier. He came over and informed us that the corking fee would be 200 euros. We had just eaten at Taillevent two nights before and paid 50 euro corking fee for the first bottle. When we asked if they could match that price the sommelier informed us that they don’t usually but that they could since it was a special occasion. A few minutes later the chef who owns the restaurant came out and shook both our hands then started to insult us. He was complaining about the fact that he had to pay his rent and his employees and that he would not accept anything less than his 200 euros corking fee. He also insulted us by saying that he doesn’t know how things are done in the US (my husband was born and raised in France and we are both fluent in French). We did not get a chance to taste the food, it might be delicious; but I would never go back to this restaurant while this chef is there. He takes himself for a culinary god."

Alleno Paris,50,Simply outstanding!,"I try each time I visit Paris to have lunch or dinner art Ledoyen (now Alleno). The meal was outstanding; the langoustine tart is perhaps the best entree I have ever eaten then followed by a simply delicious homard. The setting is outstanding. The service is peerless and I would proffer a view that if you try it once then you will understand food, wine and France!"

Alleno Paris,50,"Complex cuisine, but easy to like!","This was certainly one of the best meals I've ever had. The tasting-menu was like a many-layered symphony where all the players worked together perfectly--some solos, some counterpoint, some harmony, all expressively conceived and masterfully orchestrated by Alléno. I liked it better than a dinner I had at Le Meurice many years ago when Alléno was the chef there (a bit heavy), and I also thought it outshone a lunch I had at Ledoyen while Le Squer presided over the kitchen (a bit quirky). Wine-pairings were perfectly matched and absolutely top-rate (Domaine du Chevalier, Pierre Damoy, Château d'Yquem...). Comfortable chairs, excellent service. My only suggestion for improvement would be to plant more bushes and trees outside, to block the unsightly view of the Champs-Élysées where there always seem to be lots of trucks, temporary buildings, barricades, etc. (The stencilled paint decorations also look rather faded to me, but they're historic and otherwise beautiful.) I'm already looking forward to my next lunch here! (By the way, the chef of a wonderful Italian restaurant in Denmark once remarked to me, ""Alléno is the king!"" Right he was.)"

Alleno Paris,50,A very special meal,"A belated review, having dined here last Christmas,    For many years a fine dining experience in Paris, the home of gastronomy, had been on my 'Bucket List'.    In January 2018 we finally got to tick off that one from our list with a 3 Michelin star lunch by Yannick Alléno, who according to some reviews is one of the top three chefs in Paris, and in the Top 50 worldwide.    Yannick's restaurant is in the famous Leyoden building on the Champs-Élysées next to the Petite Palais. In the past it has entertained Napoléon and Joséphine, French Revolution politicians Robespierre, Marat, and Danton, and artists and writers like Monet, Degas, Zola, and Guy de Maupassant.    We knew we were in for an experience when we were welcomed by a top-hatted 'concierge' at the front entrance. From a visit by the sommelier to assist with the champaign selection, to the cheese trolley waiter and his vast selection, to the flambed chestnuts, to the two visits from Yannick Alléno himself, the visit was as much a theatrical event as a meal.    The menu looked deceptively simple. In reality, it was a large number of very complex courses over a leisurely 4 hours.    For me, the standout dish was the venison from Sologne. I've since tried to re-create this at home (without reaching the technical level of Yannick's food, of course!) But it remains a special memory to me nonetheless!    As expected, the service was impeccable, the venue was elegant, and the whole experience a memorable one. A highlight of our most recent visit to Paris."

Alleno Paris,50,Mikey speaks,one of the highest rated 3 stars in Paris. perfection in every sense from cuisine to wine to ambience.

Alleno Paris,50,Meal Of A Lifetime,"We booked a table well in advanced for a birthday celebration of a lifetime. From the moment we arrived we were in awe of the gorgeous decor and building. We decided we would not hold back and indulged in the champagne cart, pre fixe and wine pairing - and it was outstanding. Hands down the best meal I have ever had in my life, and likely unbeatable in the future."

Alleno Paris,50,Beyond 3 stars,"It was my first time at 3 Michelin star restaurant. Lucky me, I was welcome by the head chef of Ledoyen and he showed us the whole kitchen. I tried many orders of appetizer and all of them was fantastic! I love it every bite! But for the main course which i ordered was chicken just so so.  I promise myself to come back and eat this caviar tart for sure!!!!"

Alleno Paris,50,Stunning 3 Star expereince and food,"It was a very hot night in Paris this last time(3rd overall, first with M Alleno), and while the AC could have worked better, the chef, and staff did not miss a beat!  The food, service and of course setting was impeccable.  We have had the good fortune t have been to this establishment 3 times, and I can say this last visit was by far the best.  The menu is interesting, with the normal highlights of Squab, Sweetbreads etc that one finds at the temples of haute cuisine, but M Alleno has done an amazing job twisting old favorites and adding some of the new modern twists of Molecular cuisine without make a science project instead of food.  Splurge here -it well worth it.  Oh and a shout out to the wine staff for some superb and interesting selections!!  Bravo!"

Alleno Paris,30,Not worth Michelin 3-star,"We always go for at least one dinner at a Michelin 3-Star restaurant in Paris. We have been to Pre Catelan and Arpege on previous visits to Paris.    Ledoyen was quite disappointing given our expectations and past experience with Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris and other parts of the world. It’s worth 1-Star IMHO.    We ordered the set dégustation menu hoping to taste the best of what they had to offer. The food was excellent but lacking the presentation that one would expect from top restaurants. Our orders of Cod and Turbot came out as very normal dishes that could’ve been from any other good restaurant.    Service was good overall and expert recommendations on wine, non-alcoholic drinks, as well as coffee and tea were all good. However, we were a little taken aback that one of the waiters was “taught” how to properly extract the dessert from the hard sugar crust in which it was encased. Should not happen at a restaurant of such standing.    Environment was up to standard with sufficient space between tables to maintain privacy, plus the view of the gardens outside is quite stunning.    Good dinner but not worth the €829."

Alleno Paris,40,"Sensational food, but a bit too pretentious","I confess, that we dined here more than a year ago, but are finally catching up on some overdue reviews. We are lovers of fine food and were not disappointed at Ledoyen. We thoroughly enjoyed the lunch (tasting menu), each course was served with precision, almost choreographed by the staff - impressive! The atmosphere was very subdued (almost too quiet), and felt somewhat brusque - no opportunity to get into conversation or any type of banter with the staff)). Also, we had some trouble understanding some of the dishes (we’re probably quite famously remembered for trying to eat the puffed rice dish that housed our macerated strawberry).... these were whipped out from under us when we started to break them up (hilarious, and something we still laugh about today). Each course was superb, pure artistry, and we just wanted to savour every mouthful. The only reason why we didn’t give it the full 5 rating is because of the atmosphere - which is a shame, because everything else about it was wonderful."

Alleno Paris,20,Ledoyen banqueting (not the fine dining restaurant),"I have been invited to a special event at Ledoyen PARIS, I was thrilled to go back there since I have not been there since Yannick Alleno took over. The party was hosted in the banquet all . I have to say that I was extremely disappointed by the overall experience, the service was poor, the staff is not paying attention to the guest does not know what are the ingredients, this said this is not the worth the food is far away from what you should expect indeed it is the 70 s style, greasy, tasteless, not easy to eat with one bit. I have not seen a cocktail party so poor since a while. I can only recommend to the team to outsource this part and I am sure it will be far better."

Alleno Paris,10,3 star Michelin does not mean a great meal,"Ledoyen was supposed to be the highlight on the final night of our cultural exploration of Paris. All restaurants have off nights, i suppose. But one does not expect glitches in such quality restaurants. The few waiters were totally run off their feet. We waited an absolute age for the first course... which i didnt eat. On the positive side, the beef was tender and tasty."

Alleno Paris,50,A Temple of Gastronomy ——,A Temple of Gastronomy —— There can only be so many restaurants like this in the world….. Go for a splurge!

Alleno Paris,50,Fantastic Food and Service,"We had the tasting menu x3. There were a total of 18 courses - if you count the amuse bouches, extra courses, and the 3 flights for the entree. Just fantastic. The service was on point - helpful but not intrusive. Simon (the manager) made sure we understood what was going on and explained the history behind the restaurant- just so competent and personable! All the staff spoke very good English. My family argues over what the best course was. The red mullet with foie gras, chocolate and cardamom was awesome. I absolutely loved the fresh fir honey on the crumbled cookie with the wine jelly. Just blew my mind. The courses were small and interesting. Just had a lovely experience and was definitely impressed. Worth every euro!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,A must try in Paris,Amazing experience !! From service to quality of food and price point !!! We’ll be back ! Our hostess at the counter was knowledgeable and spoke 3 languages !! He really made a difference when explaining each dish as they were coming !!

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,Outstanding!,"Outstanding tasting menu and service, enjoyed atmosphere, which encouraged interaction with Chef's as well as other patrols."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,50,One star dining at it's best,Incredible dinner for a fantastic price. Service could not have been better. Atmosphere was top notch.

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,Nice experience,"Very good food, like always, the quail with foe was the best. Service weird at the beginning but great at the end. Only weird thing the waitress at the end asking us to leave tip at the credit card (u do not do that in France) Good Job and great food."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,40,a touch of genius,"Enjoyment to your eyes and your mouth! The food looks good as much as it tastes, It is not cheap, but, order a few small dishes and enjoy life!"

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,10,Most disappointing!,"A letter I sent to the restaurant after the last visit there a few weeks ago, unfortunately no one got back to me  I would like to tell you about the experience we had on September 26 at your restaurant.  The place was booked several weeks in advance, initially I booked just for me, but after I called and checked that one diner could have the tasting menu and the other diner could eat a la carte, I canceled the reservation for a single person and replaced it with a reservation for a couple.  When we arrived at the restaurant, the host at the entrance said there was no reservation in our name. After he checked he said he did see the cancellation but not the reservation for two and the restaurant was full so we couldn't dine that evening. Luckily the mobile phone records all the calls and I played the call to the host. The host still claimed that there was no room in the restaurant and only after we insisted, he suddenly ""remembered"" that there were 2 free places, on the side of the restaurant in front of the window facing the street. It should be noted that at no point did he apologize for the fault in receiving the order.  I ordered the DISCOVERY MENU and my wife ordered 3 courses - 2 starters and a main course.  We received the first dish together and then I continued to receive the dishes without my wife receiving a single dish. After I got the course before the last main course, we asked the waiter what was going on with my wife's second course and he said he would check. Just after I got my main course, my wife's second starter arrived and of course her main course arrived long after I had finished eating my main course.  The sauce in my wife's fish dish was very salty and inedible, my wife left more than half of the dish on the plate. The waiter who cleared the dish did not ask what the reason was, we drew his attention to the fact that the dish was not eaten due to the salty sauce, and he promised that he would pass it on, beyond that we received no reference to it.  Next to us was another couple who started after us and also ate the DISCOVERY MENU. After my wife had already finished eating, the couple got the first dessert and the second dessert while I didn't get dessert. After they finished, the shift manager came and brought them the bill and approached us with a bill in hand (probably ours). We brought to his attention that we hadn't gotten desserts yet and he made a head motion of ""I can't believe what's going on here"" and went to get us desserts.  Additional Comments:  - During the evening, at least in 3 dishes, the dish was served to before they brought me the cutlery for the dish and only after they brought it and saw that I didn't have cutlery they went to get it.  - From the bottle of water that was brought at the beginning of the meal, we poured water into our glasses only at the beginning, during the entire meal none of the waiters bothered to fill our water glasses.  It should be noted that we did not wait for the end of the meal to try to improve the situation and several times during the meal we drew the attention of the waiters and the shift manager to the service we receive, each time we were told that they take it into their attention, but as you can see, each time the situation gets worse.  After the meal, one of the waitresses came over and asked how it was.... We told her again the summary of the events and asked for your details, she took my phone number from us and promised to call...  In conclusion, this was our last evening in Paris. We chose L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon to close a circle, because the best meal on our honeymoon exactly 15 years ago (24/9) was at L'Atelier in Las Vegas and we wanted to repeat the experience, what's more, the night we dined my wife celebrated her birthday  I've had the chance to eat at many dozens of Michelin restaurants over the past few years and I've never encountered such a service experience ((I also went to eat at L'Atelier in Saint Germain a few years ago and had a great experience).  What we experienced was an evening with such terrible service that it ruined our wedding anniversary celebration and my wife's birthday celebration.  I would appreciate your reference."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,30,Artful Cattle-call,"I get it...most starred Michelin chef, every plate is meant to be an art piece. And while the food was tasty and the ""experience"" is what you are really paying for, I wouldn't go back, nor would I recommend it.    It is also the ONLY restaurant we went to in 7 nights that asked for...and EXPECTED you to tip the staff. They did nothing to impress me more than any other place we ate at. Oh well, live and learn."

L'Atelier De Joël Robuchon Saint-Germain,30,Rude at the end of service after paying,"We had a great dinner. Between six of us we spent about $1,600 in wine and food. The service was a bit slow and the wines came out slowly. Right after we paid we were told they needed our table, but we weren't finished with our wine. We politely got up and gave up our table. On the way out I spoke to the host and explained that we hadn't finished our wine. She asked what time our booking was and starting counting the hours we had been there and basically blamed us for staying too long. This could have been handled a lot better. It was rude to push us out without finishing our wine and we weren't the reason for the meal taking so long. I would have given them 7 out of 10 stars but it is dropped to 5 out of 10 for the rudeness. They clearly overbooked the restaurant and their slow service is the only reason why we had stayed so long to begin with."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,40,Great Flavours and Presentation but is it Really Worth the Price?,"The main restaurant isn't that big (although there is a private dining room off to one side) and tables are well spaced apart.    The presentation and flavours of the dishes we were served were really good. Portion sizes are very small though.    There is only a set menu of six courses. You have an option on two of the dishes. There is an extensive wine list but the selection of wines by the glass isn't very big and generally not to my taste. We weren't offered tea or coffee at the end of the meal which was a bit of a surprise.    I was a guest so didn't see the final bill but I know from the price shown on the menu that this is an expensive evening out. I've been to a lot of fine dining restaurants over the years and believe that they're overpricing this. That said, as a one off, it's worth a visit but if they want repeat customers on a regular basis, I think they should be more realistic in their pricing.    Be warned that the air-conditioning is fierce and despite me asking for it to be adjusted slightly, I shivered through the entire evening. I noticed one of the guests, who must have been here before, wearing a casual rain jacket. Bring a jumper.    They have a lot of staff milling around. Some of them are very good but I'd question what some of the others are doing other than posing."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,10,Dont visit overpriced and food quality is average,"Worst meal ever , since Chef Bjoern left Octavium the food quality dropped badly . There are not even worst 1 star . Please avoid this restaurant , overpriced and food low standards and bad taste"

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,Divine,"First time back in Hong Kong for four years and was on my own on Saturday night so chose Octavium as the place to spend it. I am so glad I did. Did the Degustazione tasting menu. It was a delight from start to finish, absolutely divine from start to finsh and worthy of both its' two stars, in fact, food wise, it can't be far off three. The Red Prawn Ravioli, one of the signature dishes, is as good as you'll ever taste, however, the Aged Pigeon for me, was the highlight of the evening. The Omi beef was also fantastic. It is also always nice when the Executive chef comes out and spends time with the diners with a sincere interest in how they are enjoying the food. Next time IN HK I will be back."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,40,Very nice dinner,"It’s white truffle season again. Our group of 6 had dinner in Octavium last night to savour the delicacy.    We all opted for the 6-course tasting menu. We also ordered 3 portions of tagliolini with white truffle to share.    All the dishes were made with top notch ingredients and tasted very good. Even the amuse bouche, beef tartare tart with white truffle, was very delicious. The following were particularly impressive:  - red prawn ravioli  - aged pigeon.    Tagliolini with white truffle didn’t disappoint. However, the white truffle shavings weren’t as generous as what we’d got in our last dinner in Octavium.    The wine pairing was nice. At HK$680 per person with 5 glasses of wine, it’s really good value for money. I just wish the staff had explained to us more about each wine.    By the time my friend booked about 3 weeks ago, the only private room had been taken. It’s still very comfortable being seated in the main dining room."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,An amazing restaurant worth going back.,The restaurant is amazing. Food was so good with beautiful presentation especially the red prawn with spaghetti. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.

Octavium Italian Restaurant,40,Great experiences,Went there the day before they were awarded Michelin 2-star. Congratulations. We tried the tasting menu with 6 courses. Dishes were very well presented & looked artistic. Tastes were decent but perhaps arguable if they’re 2-star standards. Services were great & high standards.

Octavium Italian Restaurant,20,Fair review if my meal was free?,"Just to straighten this review out first... My dinner was free... So I really shouldn't complain when someone is buying me and my family a free dinner at a one star Michelin restaurant.    To be honest, the food were mixed at best and the service was excellent. Some dishes were salty while some were bland but the beef was very good.    My reason for 2 stars is that the price over value is terrible. I guess it's expensive running a restaurant in HK during covid but I have been to many one stars in Asia, Europe and California to be absolute certain that the food is decent but definitely not for this price.    I always feel Michelin sleeps behind the wheel especially for Asian food... but this is an Italian restaurant with an Italian cook.    It sounds like a terrible review but as I mentioned, the meal was free, the place was nice and the service was brilliant.    Footnote, my daughter is a fancy fussy eater and almost every dish she whispered ""Daddy... Do I have to eat this?"" and she spent the whole night drinking lots of water (too much salt?)."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,Amazing white truffle tagliolini,"This Italian restaurant is located on 8th floor of One Chinachem Central, right in the heart of the busy financial district on Hong Kong Island. Opened in 2017, it has been awarded Michelin one-star status, with resident chef Roland Schuller leading the team.    Arriving sharp at 6:30pm and after the registration, the chef opened the secret door leading to the spacious dining area. We were seated on the window side, and immediately I came to like the décor, which showed minimalist elegance, offering a comfortable and contemporary environment.    We decided to go for the 8-course Degustation Menu ($1,888 each) and wine pairing ($880). The staff then served us a starter with Black Olives and Anchovies. The olives were good, and the quality of the anchovies was amazing, with intense savoury note but not overly salty.    The first Amuse Bouche was a Salmon Tartare with Chives. The minced salmon was seasoned beautifully, with the fish oil seeping great flavours. The chives added the fragrance and serving on a crunchy crust, this was a great beginning of a wonderful meal.    The second Amuse Bouche was visually appealing. The Parmesan Potato Ball had been added with a slice of Anchovy, and topped with a small piece of Comte, beautifully presented on a plate of seashells and green crumbs. The rich cheesy taste perfect match with the savoury flavours from the anchovy, and created further eager anticipation for our first course.    Coming to the first course, Tuna Belly with Mustard, Ikura and Beluga Caviar. The tuna belly was thinly sliced, and then mixed with tomato water to give a bit of sourness, freshening the palate. The mix of salmon roes and caviar not only provided a contrast in colour, also with different umami and texture, creating a highly complex dish of great appeal. The edible flowers on top further added to the visual delights. The wine paired was Diebolt-Vallois Prestige Blanc de Blancs Brut NV, a Champagne made from entirely Chardonnay grapes.    The second course was Goose Foie Gras with Figs and Brioche. The foie gras was slow cooked and then cut into a slide, surrounded with a fig paste decorated with small white flowers. Rich in flavours, creamy in texture, but without the heavy and oily mouthfeel of the seared version. The chef also provided a brioche toast for us to eat with the foie gras, a thoughtful gesture. The wine paired was 2020 Alois Lageder Gewurztraminer from Alto Adige.    The third course was Abalone with Black and White Truffle. The abalone was braised to perfection, tender with a nice bite, and the black truffle sauce was intense on flavours, a good complement with the umami taste of the abalone. With some white and black truffle shaved on top, it was a great combination of Japanese and Italian ingredients to the best effect. The wine paired was 2019 Planeta Chardonnay from Menfi Sicily.    In the current white truffle season, there was no reason we did not order an additional dish of this great delicacy. The White Truffle Tagliolini ($1,180) was recommended by the staff, and he also helped to split the portion into two. Chef Roland himself came to bring three pieces of white truffles and shaved a generous amount for each of us. The aromas were already noticeable from a distance, and together with the impeccably good egg pasta, offered a great culinary treat. The simple light sauce was perfectly in harmony with the white truffle notes, and for this dish alone I would like to return the restaurant again. I also ordered a glass of 2017 of Anrar Riserva from Kellerei Cantina Andrian in Alto Adige ($180) to pair.    Returning to the tasting menu, the fourth course was Spaghettini, with Uni and Crispy Garlic. The pasta was obviously different, with the fresh tomato and herbs giving a light and refreshing palate to the wonderful texture of the spaghettini. The highlight certainly was the sea urchin, very sweet and creamy, and in fact was even better than the one I had earlier in the week in a high-end sushi restaurant. The crispy garlic added a crunchy bite and additional flavours. The wine paired was 2016 Timorasso Derthona ‘Pitasso’ from Claudio Mariotto.    The fifth course was Hokkaido Scallops with Pike Roe and Egg Yolk Sauce. The scallops had been prepared in a flowery cut, seasoned perfectly to highlight the natural sweetness, and on top there were the pike roes, with a nice light amber colour. Although not as expensive as caviar they were equally good in taste, and the chef added an anchovy on top to enhance even more the umami note. The whole dish was integrated by the delicious egg yolk sauce, creamy smooth and created a real wonder of sensory delight.    The sixth course was Aged Pigeon, with Zucchini and Garlic. The pigeon breast was cooked to medium rare perfectly, very tender and juicy, with the zucchini peel made to wrap on top like a skin, with a white garlic puree in the middle. The jus was full of flavours, and together was another great feast of delights. The wine paired was 2016 Querciabella Chianti Classico Riserva.    The seventh course was Koji Aged Miyazaki Beef with Fried Veal Tendon. The prized beef was aged with koji, resulting in a dry-aged process that made the meat tenderized in a very short period, intensifying the flavours. The beef was good in taste, and even more interesting was the way the chef had deep-fried some veal tendon, which look like chips, but with a chewier bite. A creative dish and the wine paired was 2013 Brezza Barolo Cannubi.    Before the eighth course, the chef had prepared a pre-dessert. On the top was a black sesame cracker, sandwiched with sesame ice cream, and another white meringue on the bottom. The crunchy texture was good, and the ice cream was also nice, with the sesame flavours integrating throughout to make it very enjoyable. A good transition to the dessert.    Coming to the last course, the dessert was Hazelnut Tart, with Caramel Wasanbon Ice Cream, Milk and Rum. The presentation was again very good, with the Japanese fine-grained sugar added with caramel to make the tasty ice cream and put in the hazelnut tart. Feeling very satisfied and full, it was a wonderful finale to the amazing tasting menu.    Finishing with a cup of espresso, the chef also prepared Petits Fours, with a Cigar with a crisp wafer and filling with sweet creamy hazelnut mousse, a Blood Orange Biscotti, and a Chestnut Zeppole. All of them were great in taste and perfect with the coffee.    The meal was one of the best Italian dinner I had in town, and certainly justified its Michelin status. The services were equally impressive, with the staff attentive, friendly and spending time to explain each course and giving recommendations. The sommelier was also good, with each wine pairing a good match with the dish. The bill was $6,714 while it might seem a bit high, but considering we had an additional white truffle pasta, it was worth the spend."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,Excellent white truffle dinner,"I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner in Octavium.    We’re a group of 8. All of us took the 8-course degustation menu (HK$1,888 each). We also changed spaghettini with uni to tagliolini with white truffle (HK$980 supplement each).    The menu was thoughtfully curated and featured some top notch ingredients. The portions of the dishes were just right.    Our main reason for dining in the restaurant was to savour the seasonal white truffle. Tagliolini with white truffle was excellent. So was Hokkaido abalone with black truffle and white truffle. The white truffles sourced by the restaurant, which is in the same group as the 3-star 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana, must be one of the best if not the best in town. They’re of very large size with very strong flavour. And chef Roland was quite generous when shaving the white truffles in front of us.    Other courses were either very good or excellent.    I loved the following dishes in particular:  - foie gras marinated with sake which was smooth as silk  - dry aged French pigeon the meat of which was very tender and flavourful  - Miyazaki beef with fried veal tendon which was an interesting combination.    The service was impeccable.    It’s very noisy in the main dining room during my last dinner in Octavium. This time my friend booked the private room so we enjoyed ample privacy, comfort and tranquility. Therefore, it’s worth booking the private room if your budget allows."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,40,yum yum,"My very first time eating the worm looking pasta (Gnocchi) coated in a savory and creamy garlic sauce. So satisfying! It has a wonderfully soft and tender center, delights to the taste bud. 😋 2-course pasta lunch ($380) - definitely will go regularly. 👍    #Gnocchi - tiny soft-dough dumplings made from potatoes, wheat flour or semolina.    #Octavium means “8” in Latin, so it resonates with Bombana’s other restaurant 8½ Otto e Mezzo. It was opened in 2017 by michelin-starred chef Umberto #Bombana ~    📍 Octavium  8/F, One Chinachem Central, 22 Des Voeux Road Central, Central"

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,Pleasantly surprised,"Having previously been to Otto e Mezzo Bombana and not finding the meal to be particularly memorable, I did not know what to expect of its sister restaurant, Octavium. However, I was pleasantly surprised. For starters, the blue lobster was cooked perfectly so that it had just a bit of bounce whilst retaining a beautifully tender flesh on the inside; the pigeon was cooked to a textbook medium rare and had incredible umami from the black truffles and koji; the abalone was not rubbery at all and the comte cheese sauce provided a nice Italian twist to what is often served at Japanese/Chinese restaurants. For pastas, the scampi tagliolini had a rich seafood flavour that made me keep going back for more, and the red prawn linguine and malloreddus were equally delicious. For mains, the Te Mana lamb loin was juicy and evenly pink, while the stuffed zucchini flower that accompanied it was very unique, combining two styles of farro (pureed and whole). Finally, the limoncello souffle was unlike any souffle I had ever tried; as usual, the inside was nice and fluffy but what stood out was the top layer, which was browned evenly for a crisp shortbread-like texture and taste. All-in-all, a truly delicious and memorable gastronomic experience."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,I have been several times,"I have been several times at Octavium with my husband, Alessandro from Italy. We have very much enjoyed the food, usually tasting menu with the highlight of seafood linguine. Definitely italian cuisine with a twist and great quality. Chef Roland makes the difference! The restaurant is quite cozy, not too fancy, all the staff very friendly and professional.  We will go back soon with friends."

Octavium Italian Restaurant,50,"Great food, professional wine pairing and nice staff","White truffles season now. Home make Tagliolini with much white truffle. Pair with aged Barbaresco, yummy👍😋"

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Fit for a Foodie-Excellent Meal,We had the teppanyaki menu. The chef was fabulous and easily explained all the dishes. I do not eat raw fish and the chef was very accommodating. I have lived in Japan previously and the Wagyu beef was the best I have ever had ever. Splurge for this one.

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Yummy Omakase,"Ad hoc business trip in Macau for 3D2N. The first night need to join the company gathering. And the second night will be my free time. Before leaving Macau, want to try Mizumi. A wonderful night, amazing food with fresh ingredients and excellent service with detail. And lucky me, I can dining at the sushi counter(they told me only main dining when I made the reservation but they got the cancellation, so they move me to the counter)!! Their Omakase only $2,400++. Worth it!!!"

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Yummy Japense Food :),"A wonderful night at Mizumi, amazing food with fresh ingredients and excellent service with detail orientation and personalized service."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Memorable food and service,"So memorable night I had in Mizumi! All the food are fresh and yummy! I have ordered some sashimi which is recommended by staffs and it is all freshly delivered though Japan! They made the The peony shrimp sashimi to me and use the shrimp head to make tempura, it is so crispy and delicious! I must come again!"

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Best Japanese restaurant in town,"We enjoyed our dinner so much at Mizumi at Wynn Macau. The service was great, attentive and engaging. Food was fantastic as well! Will definitely recommend to all Japanese food lovers."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Attentive staff and amazing food,"It was a celebration dinner with family with 2 young kids. Staff went above and beyond to make our dinner an amazing one. Needless to say, the food was amazing and the sake collection was not bad. While the 2 kids prefer hot food, the staff made us a special arrangement where they can eat with us at the sushi table where we had our omakase. The whole experience didn't disappoint us and we will be back for our next amazing experience!"

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,30,Average experience,"I tried the Mizumi at Wynn Palace years ago but run into the Mizumi at Wynn Macao accidentally. I didnt have sushi or sashimi but explored other options. I had several dishes which were quite uniquely placed but I didnt like the steamed A4 beef with vegetables. It was really an experiment for me to try this well done and wet beef. I didnt taste the real beef after it was steamed and the only outstanding taste was water and vegetable. The next disappointment was grilled chicken with soup. The soup was good but overran the grilled chicken taste. The chef forgot diner need to taste the grilled taste of a piece of chicken. That said, its cold tofu and tempura with sweet potatoes were up to the standard. Overall, I did think that this restaurant was overrated on its food besides sushi and sashimi."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Fabulous in Macau!,For over the top service and outstanding seafood....experience excellence at Mizumi at the Wynn in Macau!

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Fabulous dinner at Mizumi,I had a fabulous dinner at Mizumi last night. Great service provided by Kazu. Very professional. The food was very nice. The decoration of the restaurant is very exquisite. Fabulous experience. Will definitely come again.

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Amazing 2 Michelin Star Japanese Restaurant,Had the omakase which was delightful. The chef is extremely attentive and the fish is top of the line. Little surprise here and there with my favorite being their seasonal fruits at the end. Have never had fruits that tasted so good. And the toro roll with shiso leaf and pickle.    The only downside is the staff sometimes does not explain how to eat the food.    A nice airy ambiance.

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Sushi to die for,We had the privilege of being able to sit at the Sushi station and were blown away with the skill presentation taste and delicate flavours delivered by a master. If you are in Macau and looking for a unique experience I think this will tick the box. It did so for us

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Best Japanese representation,"If you really want to try high quality Japanese cuisine here in Macau, the first choice is always Mizumi. Top quality and if you are lucky to meet the guest chef performance where I heard they will host every month, you can taste the best crossover from 2 masterchef at one course. I was lucky to meet the chef from Taiwan 3 star Ryugin and tried a spectacular kaiseki meal showcasing supreme craftsmanship and utmost coordination between 2 masterchefs. All their fish are freshly flown from Japan. On top it's a one of its kind restaurant where you can have sushi, tempura and teppanyaki at different areas hosted by top quality chef. That's why I keep repeatedly coming back. Just to name a few must tried dishes: sliced toro sushi where you experienced creamy toro totally melted in your month, shizo tempura with Hokkaido uni sashimi and the A5 wagyu at the teppanyaki corner. Their sommelier is also knowledgeable and do ask for a wine pairing to accommodate the dishes."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,"Fantastic food, but quite pricey","Everything from the sushi, to the service, to the sake were absolutely top notch! I'd especially mention the A4 wagyu, which was just so great that it was (almost) too much."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,A Great Restaurant,"If you love sashimi and sushi there is probably no better Japanese restaurant on earth. Take a seat at the sushi bar and see how the master chefs work their way to your sushi, and you will see how complicated it can be to do just one tiny piece of sushi, if you strive for the best. It is the branch of a famous Hokkaido restaurant but I am told that this one is better. If you want a meal of a life time, bring your cheque book and ask the chef to do the best. I had buri, toro, uni, hairy crab, and many exquisite fishes that I have not eaten before, even as a seasoned Japanese food connoisseur. Come to discover how the best sushi is made, at the bar facing the chefs. Then you will have a meal to remember. I had the best Japanese meal I have ever had here. The restaurant is rated Michelin 2-star but it is an understatement."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,As good as high end Tokyo,"One of the top sushi experiences I’ve ever had. The food quality compares with Sato in Tokyo which is saying a lot! Be prepared to drop 2k per person, but it’s well worth it."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,40,casino night,"Mizumi decor is nice, matching  Wynn decor grandiosity. It is inside the casino. Offering top grade sushi and a rarity of top grade tempora.  High end price but ingredients are high end.  Tempora here is like some specialty shop in japan. Nice and not available in hong kong."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,20,Not very impressive,I heard of the teppanyaki but the waiter who greeted us didn't even bother to inform us of its existence until we asked for it. He then brought us the teppanyaki menu. We were then led to the teppanyaki room. Luckily they have a great Italian manager who's friendly and professional! Foods was average but nicely presented.

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,30,Just average,"First I don't like the decorations, looks like a Chinese restaurant, actually looks like a simple coffee shop. We went for the teppanyaki menu in the private room, food is not bad just average, wine list is also very average and not cheap."

Mizumi at Wynn Macau,50,Personal and tasty,Came for lunch. Decor is traditional yet modern and very welcoming. Very well priced set menu and the food was brilliant. Sushi Master chef tomohiro was super friendly and provided great insight into each dish. A delight at 250hkd for the lunch set menu.

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Magical,"Everything about our experience was top class. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. Our sommelier was the best I've ever met. The wine choices were unique and interesting. The food was inventive, exquisite and of course, delicious. The tasting menu had such variety that each course was a wonderful surprise. I can't thank everyone enough for making our visit so magical."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Worth the rating,"It was a true Michelin 3 experience. Incredibly comfortable and inviting. The staff was warm, personable and very engaging. Absolutely no complaints."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,It Was Far More Than Dinner - It Was A Once In A Lifetime Experience!!!,"This was the greatest dining experience I’ve ever had. The atmosphere, service and food were absolutely fantastic. I was their for a birthday celebration and the Staff went far out of their way to make it a very special evening. We had the wine pairing with 7 course tasting menu and it was spectacular."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Nice :),Nicly done. Testing manu perfect with wone dinning - everybody should try this experience. We try this restaurant several times - always good :)

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,No competition. Sadly.,"No competition. Sadly.    I visit quite a lot of restaurants in London (and in Europe) from Bib to 3*. In brief, JP Blondet at Ducasse and his team on the floor are trading way above the competition here in London in their category, at the moment. For ex. was at a world’s famous 3* restaurant a few weeks ago in Chelsea, and it just is not “boxing in the same category”.    Some 3* should secretly visit this Dorchester “auberge” and see what’s like to make a client feel so at ease/comfortable you just do not want to leave either because of the cuisine or because the staff is so professional (they have a new RM, a young, very pro and may I say, very attractive lady!).    With prices so high now in London (funny how 1* restaurants are now roughly GPB 100+, 2* GBP 200 and 3* GBP 300 excl. wines), those restaurants better be not just good but excellent, out of this world.    An example? I had a coffee/cream-based desert in my 3*Chelsea restaurant in early July, the type of desert that it is easy to prepare well ahead of customers coming at 1815. Yep! 1815! No choice! Who wants a coffee/creamy based desert on a hot Saturday of July? Seasons? Who cares? What are they going to serve in November? Even the Ritz changed their excellent souffle to adapt to the current season! But a 3* In Chelsea ? No!!! Who the pastry chef works for? Customers? 😊 You must be joking! They should be so lucky to have the privilege to dine in our restaurant I hear them saying….    Do those restaurants think they can keep on charging those prices with those practices and keep their ratings….?    So yes I am not going to continue to pay GBP 300 for a restaurant whose staff on the floor and in the kitchen are working for themselves instead of working for clients like in this Chelsea-based eatery.    Here I had a cherry-based desert and my friend a strawberry. Seasons fruits. Season deserts. Yes more risks of wasting fragile strawberries or cherries… No risk of wasting coffee beans true…..Your P&L is safe...    The cuisine here is innovative, I tasted some excellent langoustines in a cold consommé, a Scottish wagyu beef with a great jus, highly refined and highly technical in my view etc…    Prices have gone up and now dining in London is really expensive. Some restaurants will be able to stay competitive. That’s the case here. Not certain for many restaurants. I am not very optimistic for those high end restaurants that require customers to come on Saturday eve a 0615, and be out by 0930 whilst serving dishes that are so “ready-to-serve” by the Kitchen/floor staff so they can get out and have their evening for “only” GBP 500 per head inc. VAT… Well no thank you.    Again not the case here.    Not cheap but thankfully, here you could almost say this is great value for money. Almost! 😊"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,"Recommend, however…","Having dined here before we were looking forward to another wonderful experience with a journey through amazing creative culinary delights and impeccable service that you would would expect from a three star. However the sparkle is not quite as it once was, the food was delicious and beautifully prepared but a little lacking in creativity and the service was not three star attentive service from all the front of house (some training issue’s possibly?). I have eaten more creative food and had far more attentive service at Sketch and Helene Darroze. Wine pairings and non alcoholic pairings with the tasting menu were also not mentioned at all which was rather odd? Overall the whole experience felt a little lacklustre and lacking that three star experience you would expect. Maybe an off night with new staff but at that level there should not be any off nights!!"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,:A Gracious Evening Marred by A Few Glittering Missteps,"The occasion of my birthday guided us to grace the opulent interiors of a restaurant which we’ve had the privilege to experience before. In its magnificent splendour and culinary prowess, it had previously managed to leave us awestruck, an experience that etched a permanent memory in our hearts. This visit, while mostly splendid, revealed a subtle diminution in its previously undoubted sparkle and grandeur.    The fare, it must be said, remained as exceptional as ever, a testament to the culinary maestros behind the scenes. Each dish was a cornucopia of flavours, an exploration of the delicate artistry that has rightly earned this establishment its coveted place among the top 3 Michelin-starred restaurants globally.    However, certain unexpected glitches did mildly tarnish our evening. Upon expressing my preference for a teetotal evening, my wife duly requested a non-alcoholic cocktail menu for me. To our dismay, this detail, as seemingly insignificant as it may be for some, was overlooked. Inexplicably, this led to an all-encompassing assumption that our table had opted for an abstemious evening. Despite my wife’s order of a Campari and soda from another steward, the concept of wine pairings was not broached thereafter.    A redeeming feature was the delightful young lady who enthusiastically explained the intricacies of the tasting menu. Her insightful knowledge, coupled with her keen willingness to accommodate my daughter’s dietary needs, was a refreshing example of attentive service.    In the spirit of the occasion, I elected to adorn my dishes with black truffles, an additional indulgence I was keen to treat myself to. Regrettably, this augmentation was overlooked, resulting in an absence of the anticipated truffle infusion.    In summation, while our visit was generally delightful, it lacked the breathtaking ‘wow’ factor we had come to associate with this prestigious establishment. Regardless, we remain hopeful that future visits will recapture the immaculate brilliance and meticulous attention to detail that this esteemed restaurant is renowned for."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Amazing,"Having dined previously at other 3 and 2 starred restaurants (eg Helene Darozze, Gordan Ramsay, Waterside Inn) my wife and I both agreed that this was the best by far in terms of food and service. Obviously at a price but you know the drill when you book here…"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Unbelievable Experience,"Absolutely superb! The decor and the food and the service were just Alain Ducasse again, proved his exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey! The waiters were very polite and descriptive in their food presentation. The staff were all smiles and made us feel very special. It was a very special dinning experience in Monaco."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,Return visit… good but lacking full 3 Michelin star finesse,"I’ve always felt that AD@Dorchester has been underrated in London - it’s consistently had 3 Michelin stars for an exceptionally long time and is relatively easy to find a table at. However my most recent visit was ever so slightly disappointing. Objectively, a great dinner - we had the full tasting with the top wine flight pairings - but there were too many imperfections for this to really be 3 Michelin stars. Small things like sloppily placed cutlery, inconsistent table service and long waits for attention - not a huge deal, and certainly first world problems, but all added to a sense that the restaurant was lacking that ultimate polish. Feels more like a place to go for fine dining tourists and instagrammers. Having said that, my wife and I both enjoyed the meal."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Great dinner and outstanding service,A lovely dinner with the tasting menu and wine pairings. It does last a long time (4 hours) but it was filled with creative food and great service. their communications pre arrival helped with one in our group who had a food allergy. great restaurant

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,30,Where did everyone go?,"I took my wife here to celebrate our 46 th Wedding Anniversary while in town for the Chelsea Flower Show. The initial meal and service was as one would expect but then everyone disappeared! we were seated near the street in an area away from the main dining room with two significant pillars blocking the view but with 3 other tables sharing the space. After finishing our mains, we sat for 35 minutes awaiting clearance of dishes and desert menus. We finally succeeded in signaling for the bill. While I can appreciate that some restaurants struggle with staffing, this clearly was not the issue here. There was plenty of staff but the pillars block their view of these tables and as the restaurant was nearly full their attention drifted away from us. A sad and disappointing end to what started out well but petered out dismally. What a shame."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Truly exceptional ♥️,"Quality and service which you would expect at a three Michelin star restaurant. A wonderful culinary journey from start to end - dishes served at the start had clean and refreshing flavours, followed on with bold, meaty flavours. Ended with cheese course and a beautiful sorbet dessert. At the end of the service, my partner was given a chocolate gift, very thoughtful!    It was the perfect place to celebrate a special birthday."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,10,Poor service,"I visited Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester for my birthday with my wife. We had the tasting menu and the food was exquisite apart for the fish that wasn't anything special nor tasty. We very much enjoyed the medallion lobster, the scallop and the he venison.    The service however was a big let down for a 3-stars Michelin restaurant. We had a glass of champagne when we sat and the sommelier put maybe 50ml in my wife's glass while my glass was filled normally. I never saw that in any restaurant in the world, regardless of their price or how many Michelin stars they have. That was a bad way to start the diner and spoiled a bit the good feel factor of the arrival. The total bill for 2 tasting menus, 2 glasses of champagne at the beginning and half-bottle champagne during the diner was £561.    When we left and got our jackets, I noticed my Louis Vuitton pin wasn't on my jacket anymore. I told the staff and they started looking on the floor for it. I ended up finding it after a while, but not the whole pin, the back was still missing. That was rather annoying to see. I was told they are going to keep looking for it and that I would be contacted. I wasn't and after some days I got in touch with them. At first they were dismissive and when I told them I'm not happy with the way they're treating this a manager then called me. They told me they're still looking for the back part but I'm not expecting it to find it.    To spend above £500 on a diner and then to be disrespected I find unpardonable. I'm not going back there again."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Exceptional meal,We booked this restaurant as a double birthday celebration and our first three star michelin restaurant. We were not disappointed quite simply the best meal I have ever eaten. We picked the tasting menu with a wine flight and when the first course came out I knew we were going to be in for a beautiful meal. The lobster dish was stunning and the wine choices complimented the food. The real highlight was getting to go into the kitchen and meet Jean- Philippe the executive chef.    Worth every penny and I'm so glad we picked here for our first three star meal.

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Simply world-class!,"This was a perfect eveing from the start to the end! First of all the service and ambience is perfect - from the first interaction at the entrace all through the evening! Friendly, super professional, knowledgable and yet a little nice ”french formal” service to make it an evening to remember. We had the Tasing Menue and its a perfect choice, well balanced dishes presented in a perfect way - simply world class food. We did not go for the wine menue instead we selected wine and aperetifs from the excellent and extensive wine list - simply perfect! All in all a world class fine dining experience with world class service. If you once in your life want to dine at a three star restaurant this one should be high up on your go-to-list!!!"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,20,Very bad booking experience (for a £610 restaurant gift voucher),"Rarely do I find the time to write a review so it has to be about an extraordinarily good or bad experience.    I contacted the reservation team for Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester on Wednesday evening as I wanted to offer a gift certificate for a total value of £610 for a decade birthday that happened the next day.    I was explained that I needed to fill a PDF form, either with a specialized piece of software or by printing it then scanning it, in a much outdated fashion, and that I also needed to fill my payment information on a form on a website, even though the payment would be made later, in as much of an outdated manner. I wonder if all their clients need to be computer science engineers to be able to follow these parallel procedures. Everything could have been handled with a single online page with an instantaneous payment form.    The same evening I dutifully filled the PDF form and sent the payment information. I was told they would check both the form and the payment information on Thursday and that they would send the voucher at the latest on Friday morning.    This Friday afternoon I called my relative that was supposed to receive it and he hadn't. I then checked my mailbox and saw that the reservation team had sent me an email asking me to send the form, as if I had sent nothing!    I called them, and after much difficulty in trying to get someone from that team—being told that the restaurant was closed even though the reservations team is supposed to be open before—, I was told to call after 6PM and ended up being called back before that.    The agent coldly told me that they did not receive the email and did not seem concerned to look through their spam folder, even though I was in a cab and it was impractical for me to work with email before the office closed. Considering I didn't receive any delivery error message, I am doubtful that they didn't receive it. I eventually forwarded the initial email that contained the form, using my smartphone.    Later this evening I finally received an email from a new person, the reservations manager, saying that everything was in order and asking me whether they should wait for the next weekday, on Monday, before sending the gift certificate that was planned for “tomorrow”! The “tomorrow Thursday“ from my email on Wednesday, had become a next week… Apparently my request hadn't been transferred to her with the proper context of a lost email and being already late.    When I read and replied to this aggravating email 30 minutes later, I received an out-of-office email: “the reservations office is currently closed and will reopen on Saturday 12th November 2022”, which is 8 days later! (Why would they close for so long?) They hadn't bothered to call me to get my answer to this irrelevant question for which I apparently had only a few minutes to answer.    I tried to call the reservation team number that had called me earlier but it wasn't publicly accessible “the number you're calling does not exist”, so I called the number in the email signature, then got transferred multiple times in an unceremonious manner the same as earlier, and finally talked to someone at the restaurant.    She showed no empathy for my panicking over the risk to miss the deadline by four or eight days, and coldly informed me that the voucher had been sent after all, which I hadn't been informed of. At that point, I mentioned that I would appreciate if they said they were sorry about the many problems. She ignored it.    Finally I received an email 30 minutes later, from the reservations manager who thought that yesterday was tomorrow, and who—at last!— apologized in due form and offered to check with their IT team about the lost email. She also called me another 30 minutes later, apologizing very politely, yet offering no commercial gesture. I personally consider that a symbolically added £30 to my £610 gift certificate would have made up for the displeasing experience and the stress that could have been avoided. As far as I'm concerned, that was a bit too late to accept their apology anyway, as that last mistake was the straw that broke the camel's back, but hopefully this review will help change their booking process.    In the end, the voucher was sent one day late, which is acceptable, but at the cost of a great deal of stress on my part, which I feel is unacceptable for an establishment of this caliber. I can only hope that the experience of my relative at the restaurant will be exceptional to make up for it, hoping the service will not be as disdainful as some of the people I've had on the phone. I've had the experience of booking with several 3 star Michelin restaurants all over France and while there can always be a few issues or small misunderstandings, I have never been faced with such unapologetic nonchalance, until the late intervention of the reservations manager."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,30,Food just not 'wow',"Service is very attentive, surroundings are nice, but this very formal restaurant just didn't deliver on food. In terms of taste to value- I have eaten in many better restaurants. Presentation OK but not as good as Core by Clare Smyth for example"

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Amazing place,An amazing experience! When entering the restaurant you immediately notice the class of the place as well as the quality of the finishes. The interior is modern playing with white and milky colours somehow reaching beige in some points. The tables are set in the space and well assembled. The service and the maitre are excellent in all situations of the evening. But the most important part is the food. The food is a world for its own. Classic with modern touches. Some experimental dishes as well that not always need to be on point but delineate the handwriting of the local chef.  A wonderful evening and I hope to visit this place soon again.

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Giving this 5/5 despite there being some things I didn’t like because the food is too good not to,"This place is expensive but worth EVERY penny for a very special occasion in my opinion.  I loved that we were able to have 1 tasting menu and 1 a la carte as most places the table has to have the same thing. I of course went for the tasting menu and I highly recommend it even if some of the things don’t sound like they are to your taste - for example I don’t like wasabi, aubergine or oyster and I was served all three at some point during my seven courses and LOVED every second of it. Our menu was:  1. Scallop with beurre blanc and caviar  2. Mackerel with beetroot and wasabi  3. Lobster medallion with chicken quenelle, perigold truffle and semonlina pasta  4. Turbot with blackcurrant and hazelnut  5. Veal with oyster and aubergine  6. Cheese selection  7. Vassout Pear  As if this wasn’t enough food, there were multiple extras and amuse bouches plus lots of bread which was simply a delight! All the staff are great but there were three in particular who were very memorable and felt went above and beyond. Stupidly we didn’t get their names but one was the a young-ish man who served us each course (he has an English bull terrier dog if that helps) one was the gentleman who explained the menu and one was a lovely lady who was just generally around to answer queries.  The few things I didn’t like were firstly we arrived at 6pm for dinner and the doors were locked so we were standing outside with other people in this little doorway outside China tang like we were waiting for a rollercoaster or a cinema, it didn’t feel very sophisticated given the nature of the establishment. Secondly, one of the groups we were standing with were wearing trainers, T-shirts and jogging bottoms and initially they were denied entry. However, they claimed they visited yesterday in similar attire and the staff at the door said they would check with management. 5 mins after we were seated we saw them all enter the restaurant and take their seat. If you have dress code rules that we’ve all got to adhere to then so should they. It felt very much like they were allowed in as they had a lot of money to spend (don’t we all, we are after all at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester.) The third thing I didn’t like which is short term is the the toilets are a mile away from the actual restaurant. A member of staff takes you through China Tang and across to the main ballroom toilets and waits for you as you’d get lost otherwise. She did kindly explain that they are using the ballroom toilets due to hotel renovations which is how I knew it was short term but still annoying to have to go outside and back inside just to go for a wee. The toilets are lovely I will say that! Would I recommend here as a 3 star Michelin restaurant choice, absolutely. This far exceeds the other 3 Michelin star place I’ve been to (which I won’t name.) I would also be intrigued to visit the Dorchester again for China Tang or the Grill as I’ve heard good things about them too."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,30,Disappointed,"Firstly the surroundings are a little imposing , as we were the first there , I found that the staff were constantly watching us and it made me feel a little uncomfortable and intimidated. The staff were excellent and attentive and indeed could not fault in anyway . We enjoyed the taster menu .. however I was disappointed with at least 3 of the courses. Several dishes were just too complex with flavours , example was the beetroot dish which in my mind was just a watery bowl of beetroot broth . One of the dishes had Greek yogurt in it and this was all I could taste..way too overpowering. Wines very expensive as was the Port and Cognac . We left feeling underwhelmed and void of any real food experience. To say I woke up this morning disappointed is an understatement . This was the highlight of our trip to London and it just left me feeling very deflated, never mind £1000 out of pocket . I would not go back and I’m afraid I could not recommend this restaurant to others. There are much much better restaurants in London and much cheaper . La Gavouroch by Michelle Roux is much much better . Sorry but this was a let down and by quite a bit ."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,30,OK but not upt to 3 Star standard - disappointed.,"We had the 7 course tasting menu. Impeccable service - friendly staff. Dining room is very smart but in my view quite masculine and dark with not a lot of really nice stylish elements... I know it cost a bomb to redo but no to my taste. (Except the table lamps were beautiful). Of the 7 dishes, 2 were excellent - the cucumber/raw sea bass and the lobster (signature dish). The rest were a bit ""ho-hum"" and the turbot dish was disliked by all 4 of us. Comparing ths to other UK 3 stars - eg Core, Waterside, Fat Duck - it is not in the same league. 2 star maybe and at a commensurately lower price."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Birthday Treat,"As a birthday treat, it doesn't get more opulent than the Dorchester, a first dining experience in a 3 michelin stared restaurant and it did not disappoint.  The service from the moment we stepped over the threshold was outstanding. Very attentive staff but also finely balanced with a element of discretion.  Boris and Danielle did a fabulous job of looking after us, explaining each dish and wine pairing eloquently and with passion.  The food was delicious, going for the 7 course tasting menu. I was surprised to see 3 out of the 7 courses being either fish or shellfish and only 1 meat dish. As a fish lover this had no consequence to our choice but think for others it may deter people from choosing the amazing menu.  One slight grumble was the renovation work meant going to the toilets meant walking out of the restaurant, outside and into the adjacent door, going down and up so stairs and round lots of corridors. I needed a breadcrumb trail to find my way back. This is only temporary but people with limiting mobility may struggle.  Each dish was as good if not better than the last, the courgette starter and Lobster courses being outstanding. A beautifully discreet birthday dessert was also presented, I request no candles and a sign of respect for the passing of our queen earlier in the day, and the request was followed through.  Overall a wonderful dining experience, thank you to everyone that made us feel special and welcome."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Pure Class,"We ate at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester on our Honeymoon and it was absolutely incredible. As soon as we arrived, the door was opened for us by two members of staff working in synch. We were shown to our table and talked through the menu by the waiters. The service was incredibly attentive and friendly and we felt relaxed throughout the meal. The food was amongst the best we have ever tried and each course was well balanced and cooked to perfection. We really appreciated the small touches they put together because it was out Honeymoon. Overall, we would definitely recommend a meal at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester and will definitely be returning in the future."

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,40,Nice Christmas meal,Went for the tasting menu and had a very enjoyable experience. The restaurant has a nice decor and is laid out beautifully with large tables giving a nice view of the whole restaurant. The food was presented nicely and of a really high standard with very knowledge staff. I’ve eaten in many Michelin Star restaurants and whilst the experience was lovely I would say I have had better experiences at other restaurants within London.

Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,50,Exceptional,After experiencing the tasting menu accompanied with the wine experience I don't think I can ever eat out anywhere else ever again with a modicum of enjoyment compared to this meal.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,10,This restaurant does not deserve to be a Michelin 3-star one,"We dined at the restaurant and we had been many Michelin starred restaurant all around the world.    We decided to try Joel Robuchon HK and had the worst experience not only as a Michelin starred one, but just overall.    Food - it was really just okay! Ramsey in London; French Laundry, Single Thread in US; Caprice, Bo innovation in HK, ABaC in Barcelona and many many more are far above JB.    We had the tasting menu and ordered a white truffle pasta to share. For dishes on tasting menu was nothing speculator, I had had better one. When we tasted the pasta, initially we felt there wasn’t much truffle taste as they claimed 10g of fresh truffle. All we could taste was cheese, we provided feedback to the server, pretty much was told truffle was cooked into the pasta, but honestly we could not even nose any truffle in the dish. Later on, another server came and said 1g of truffle was cooked into the sauce and 9g was on the pasta, we told him we didn’t taste any and we didn’t see any truffle on top and that, they should shave the truffle when dish was served. He then subsequently said they forgot to shave the truffle on top, is this a joke for a dish that cost close to US$200. This mistake should never have been made in any restaurant. We felt we were cheated as they think they can take advantage for someone they think were visitors. The server initially tried to argue with us and until the end, they forgot the truffle. At the end, he offered to shave fresh truffle on our last beef dish instead. We were so pissed as we felt we didn’t think they treat their customers properly and thought that we were just “stupid” that we didn’t know what food is. We told him we did not want to see him any longer. At the end, they took the dish off the final bill, but there is enough humiliation. Party of 4 with wine at US$500 a head left with feeling being insulted. This is Joel Robuchon Hong Kong!    Service - again, noting special enough to mention. We were at Bo Innovation couple night ago, service there is top notch even they were 80% to capacity. Night before at Nicholini service was friendly.    For anyone reading this, don’t waste your money in this restaurant. Go to Caprice at Four Season or 8½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA in the same complex at Landmark will give you a much more pleasant experience and you will be treated properly."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Proper three star,"L'Atelier Robuchon in the Landmark Building in Hong Kong has held 3 stars for a number of years, and I think deservedly so... My daughter and I ate à la carte, and my daughter's lobster spaghetti with caviar and her ""Oeuf caviar"" were both very good; so was my langoustine en papillotte and my sweetbread main - the latter of very good quality. My wife and her friend had the lunch menu with each an add-on, lamb for my wife and lobster for her friend. Both were very happy. The bread basket is superb, the comté rolls standing out. We had a bottle of 2012 Kongsgaard Chardonnay, which was , as you would imagine, very good. Service was virtually flawless, something that cannot currently be taken for granted in Hong Kong, even in high end estabishments...."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Excellent meal but ….,As usual this is where we love to have lunch as it’s definitely less expensive than dinner. 🤪 Food is definitely great and service impeccable. Prices has gone up more than double three years ago. However it’s still great food

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Dining at Robuchon has been the most wonderful one.,Dining at Robuchon has been the most wonderful one. Fresh food with fabulous presentation. We enjoyed the food very much and were truly grateful for the fantastic arrangement for birthday celebration. A big thank you to the staffs for making my birthday distinctive and memorable.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,When you don’t want a meal to end,"It is many years since I last visited, for a restaurant to maintain its standard is a challenge, to exceed is exceptional. Thoroughly enjoyable."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Very good lunch,"I’d lunch at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon with a friend.    Yellow tail carpaccio with citrus dressing and Espelette pepper, one of the new dishes on the menu, was beautifully presented and tasted refreshingly delicious. Other dishes were very good too.    However, the signature mashed potato wasn’t hot enough. And the wait time between courses was a little too long. Maybe it’s because the restaurant is now back to its full seating capacity.    The service was commendable. I’d like to mention Sophie in particular. She always takes very good care of me. Her professionalism and attention to details are exceptional."

Free-ranged Quail and Foie Gras, Served with Mashed Potato  鵪鶉脾超級滑，油脂分布啱啱好。呢對鵪鶉脾有令我驚艷到。😍但我最愛其實係呢道菜既Side dish。🤭但薯蓉真係搞唔掂，一口接住一口咁食。薯蓉上邊有幾片黑松露，個口感好綿密好軟。唔係普通既薯蓉係混合左奶油。🤤    3. King Crab and Avocado Cannelloni, with Citrus and Vanilla Condiments  對於唔食牛油果既我，都比呢道菜吸引左。😍用牛油果包住帝王蟹，外層仲放上咸香既魚子醬。成道菜超級鮮。牛油果🥑同蟹🦀既配合太完美了。    今次係第一次去米芝連餐廳，成個好奇寶寶咁。一開始仲唔敢周圍影下相。🤭成個環境好舒服餐廳格調係黑紅黑紅。🔴⚫️    同埋一去到就上左一大盆餐包，有各式各樣每款兩個，我諗返起都有成十幾二十個包。😂另外，臨走既時候佢仲會幫你打包好未食既包。😚最後最後，令我最心心念念係最後送既朱古力磅蛋糕🥹真係超級超級好食，超濃朱古力味。勁想再食但之後去過佢地cafe都好似唔多見有得買。    呢間一定會再返去食，但我就Bookmark左下次去東京個間😙因為惠比壽個間太有feel☺️    ______________________________  💰價錢: HKD $2500-3000/ Per one    😋味道: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️    📍地址: 中環皇后大道中15號置地廣場4樓401號舖    #hongkong#hkfoodie#hkig#foodgasm#foodphotography#hkfoodblogger #hongkong"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,30,Robuchon should be better! Food great but complacency.,I have been dining at Robuchon as a guest of a generous friend for over 15 years . He is a frequent patron for lunch and dinner - probably the most frequent patron . While the ambience and food are excellent the time that we have to wait for the various courses is consistently disappointing . Regularly replenished baskets of bread fill the gap - perhaps to compensate for the modest portions when they eventually arrive in front of you - but this is but what you expect from a restaurant with a global reputation . This is a view shared by all my friends’ guests and needs to be heeded by the management . General Manager please take note .

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,10,Surprised they still have 3 Michelin stars!!,"Shocked that they still have 3 Michelin stars! We last visited before COVID and it was splendid back then. This most recent visit was a disappointment: food was very average (only their signature mashed potato was memorable); service was terrible and you can see poor coordination and communication amongst staff, at one stage a chef came out of the kitchen to shout at the waitstaff, and we waited 50 minutes for our dessert. Hygiene also questionable as the dessert trolley was just exposed the whole time, most items without lids/coverings. The decor is the same as before (i.e. can see a lot of wear and tear). We also picked the cheese trolley, the manager did not even bother explaining the cheeses, just asked what we wanted; we later saw the same manager explaining thoroughly the different types of cheese to some customers in the VIP room (in contrast, when we visit L’Envol, they always take time to explain their cheeses to all customers, perhaps they treat all customers as VIP, something Robuchon should learn). In short, absolutely no interest to visit again and will recommend that friends skip this mediocre but expensive fine dining restaurant from now on."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Maintained its 3-star glamour and taste,"It has been more than six years since my last visit, and this restaurant has continued to maintain its Michelin 3-star status, now for nine consecutive years, so it is with expectation we return tonight to explore what new experience it has installed for us.    The décor has not changed, with the counter seats surrounding the open kitchen, with the colourful bell peppers and other vegetables decorating the stainless-steel frames, with also the black and red tone creating a warm and intimate atmosphere.    We both order the 9-course Signature Menu ($2,980) and I also opt for wine pairing ($1,450). To start, the staff brings us the Breadbasket, with an assortment of different bread made in-house. Bringing back good memories, we need to remind ourselves not to eat too many before the course begins.    The Amuse Bouche is Waffle, with the fillings comprising some Langoustine from New Zealand and Hokkaido Sea Urchin, mixed with Bechamel Sauce, before baking them. The crunchy texture of the waffle, with the creamy and tasty fillings, is an amazing starter and set us up with high anticipation on the courses to come.    The first course is Sologne Imperial Caviar. Presented beautifully in an egg-shaped container, the abundance of caviar forms the bottom, with the Lobster Jelly forming the middle layer, and the Cauliflower Cream being the top part. While a bit salty on its own, the caviar and lobster jelly have great umami flavours, becoming balance with the touch of the cream. The wine paired is Ruinart Blanc de Blancs.    The second course is Rock Lobster. Another great presentation, the Australian lobster meat has been slow cooked to keep its crunchy texture, and then brushed with a thin layer of lobster broth jelly on top to enhance its flavours. With a slice of Black Truffle to enrich the fragrance, the most amazing part for me is in fact the Macedonia Salad underneath, made with finely chopped pieces of Carrot, Peas, Tobiko, with hints of Cayenne Pepper to give a light spicy note to the poppy texture. The sauce on the bottom is a mix of black and white, made from Balsamic Vinegar and Mayonnaise. The wine paired is 2017 Arnaud Lambert Clos David Saumar Breze.    The third course is Baby Artichokes, the most tender and prized portion of the vegetable, which has been deep-fried in tempura style with a thin layer of batter. A Puree made with Artichokes and Chickpea offers a creamy and flavourful complement, and together with the Curcuma Emulsion with its unique earthy flavour and Piquillo Pepper extract of its sweet note, is delicious and not in any way heavy or oily. The wine paired is 2014 Markus Molitor Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Spatlese.    The fourth course is Raviolis. The raviolis, for me, are a touch undercooked, with the texture of the dough still a bit too hard. The fillings are however very tasty, with the runny cheese providing a gratifying experience on the bite. The Comte Foam, with the finely chopped Black Truffle and shaved cheese, is highly complementary on the palate. The wine paired is an interesting 1999 Chateau Musar Blanc.    The fifth course is Pan-Seared Sea Scallop. The large Hokkaido scallop has been beautifully pan-seared and caramelized, and the chef has added some spring onion, grated ginger, and leek as condiment on top. On the side there is some shiso flowers to add colour and fragrance, together with Sologne Caviar and celeriac. The sauce is a special Kumquat Reduction, with the citrus flavours appealing, also having good acidity to give vibrancy to the dish. The wine paired is 2020 Marco Capra Bricco Dalle Merende Moscato d’Asti.    The sixth course is Roasted Maine Lobster, serving with both the tail and claw. On top of the meat is a crisp made with the lobster brown meat, on top of some Baby Spinach together with Wasabi foam. The chef has taken a creative twist and breaking down the Bearnaise Sauce into its three components of Egg Yolk sauce, Tarragon, and Shallot to go with the lobster. Very tasty. The wine paired is 2007 Domaine Bouchard Corton Charlemagne.    The seventh course is Free-Range Quail and Foie Gras. My favourite dish in the evening, the quail breast is cooked to pink and seasoned perfectly, tender, and juicy, with the foie gras lightly seared on top, giving a soft silky bite. Together with Wild Girolles Mushrooms and Parsley, the earthy note of the mushroom provides the wonderful marriage in flavours, with the jus impeccable in taste. On the side the chef has prepared some silky creamy Mashed Potato, as well as a cup of Consommé with intense flavours. I am amazed how the consommé can remove the heaviness of the course. The wine paired is 2011 Louis Jadot Vosne-Romanee Les Beaux Monts.    The eighth course is Smooth Passionfruit Cream with Rum Granita and Coconut Mousse. Served in a cup and on first impression reminds me of an iced coffee, this dessert has multi-dimension of flavours, with the bottom layer of pineapple and passionfruit cream slightly sour to contrast with the bitter rum granita providing refreshing, palate cleansing effect. The coconut mousse is soft and linked up all the elements of the different flavours nicely, and per the suggestion of the chef, each scoop should pick up all the three layers to enjoy in one go.    The ninth course is Fresh Raspberries. The presentation is beautiful, with Lychee Chocolate Cream on the bottom layer, follows by a Raspberry Jelly in the middle, and on top are the Raspberry Sorbet with some Fresh Raspberries. The dessert has a great balance of sweet and sourness, and while the raspberry is featured in multiple formats, we do not feel boring. The wine paired is 2008 Chateau Suduiraut.    Included in the menu is Coffee or Tea, and I pick a Double-Espresso, with Home-Made Caramel to go with, while my wife opts for Peppermint Tea. The staff also very thoughtfully ask whether we want to pack the breads home, which we happily say yes.    The Petits Fours include Madeleine, Earl-Grey Flavoured Macaron, and Dark Chocolate. All these small pieces are tasty and go extremely well with the coffee, finishing our wonderful, satisfying meal on a high note.    The service is nice, with the sommelier and staff helpful in explaining all the courses, but perhaps they can go a bit deeper into the details like how the chef prepares the dish and the origins of ingredients. The bill is $8,270 and while it is not cheap, I can appreciate why the restaurant has been able to retain its 3-star status all these years, and I look forward to returning, hopefully not having to wait for another six years."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,A good meal to start a year,"I’d lunch in Joël Robuchon with a friend who hadn’t been there before. I’d booked a table so that he’d try the desserts from the dessert trolley which isn’t available in the counter area.    The meal was as good as always. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service too.    I only took 3 courses since I wasn’t hungry and I’d already tried both soups on the menu during my previous visits to the restaurant.    When I knew pâte en croûte (one of my favourite dishes of the restaurant which hadn’t been made for more than a year), I immediately decided to take it. Le cochon ibérique was sublime. Pluma is the rarest cut of the prestigious Iberian pork and is taken from the neck end of pork loin. The meat, which was served medium rare, was very tender, succulent and flavourful.    Only when I saw the bill did I realise there’d been a slight increase of price. Still, it’s value for money."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,My favorite daily restaurant all times,This is second times for the new chef's creation. Food is better than the first time. Some dishes are nicer and some dishes are not. I think the desert has bigger room to improve. I will come back as usual 😊

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,2 meals in a row,"I booked lunch in Joël Robuchon about 3 months ago. Nowadays the restaurant accepts bookings up to 3 months and it’s so popular for lunch that I usually need to call 3 months in advance to secure a reservation.    Only after I’d booked lunch did a friend invite me to her birthday dinner in the same restaurant (the day immediately after the date of my lunch). In the end, I went to both dinner and lunch.    We’d a private room for dinner and counter seats for lunch. I enjoyed both meals (each with a different group of friends). The food was exquisite and delicious.    Of course dinner was more sumptuous and lasted much longer. The menu featured a number of signature dishes of the restaurant, most of which were made with luxurious ingredients like caviar, white truffle, langoustine, lobster and wagyu beef. There’re 2 choices for the main course (quail or beef). On the recommendation of the staff, most of us chose Chateaubriand beef with foie gras in Rossini style in vintage Port wine sauce. It’s sublime and undoubtedly the best dish of the night.    I only took 3 courses for lunch after a big dinner the night before. The dishes were lighter but still delicious."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,2nd New chef here in a year,"The previous three stars chef is no longer working here. The chef I had today is the second new one in this half year. He is better than the previous one but may not be as good as the three stars one.  The free starter (something like crab steam egg?) was worse than before as he added too much ginger. It was not as sweet N ginger overpowered the whole dish.  My friend ordered poached egg which I found the chef may consider using a better Japanese egg(蘭王）in order to get stronger egg taste, he should use cheese n ham instead of crispy fried rice outside.  I ordered Foie Gras with cold corn soup.  It tasted ok but slightly too salty and it need more wine jelly for balance the taste.    For the main, I had slow cook piegon(+HKD280) which I found it heavenly, it is much better than the 3stars chef 's one. I give it full score. However, mashed potatoes can be more airy and smoother.  My friend has lobster spagetti(+HKD190?), which was lack of salt. It was better than the 3 stars chef one but still not a perfect dish.  I ordered chestnut desert which was good but not extraordinary , my friend said it is slightly too sweet but I can accept it. My friend had a vanilla cream cake which was below standard as not enough vanilla taste.  The price is higer as the pigeon dish did not have surcharge last year. But I will be back even it is not extremely good value as before."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Rewarding Signature Menu,"L'Atelier is part of a group of three eateries by legendary French chef Joel Robuchon that are situated at the Landmark Atrium in Central. It is an open kitchen concept with the expected colour scheme and fine dining experience which has been consistently very good over the years. Opening hours are 12pm to 2.30pm (lunch) and 6-10pm (dinner), advance reservations are required for seating.    We have had mostly very rewarding meals here over the years including a recent dinner, whereby we enjoyed the Signature Meal, featuring 8 courses along with their famous bread basket as well as coffee and petit four. Note, there are 3-5 course set lunches and you can order directly off the a la carte menu as well if preferred. With the Signature Meal, you need to allow for a 3 hour dinner. Further note that the kitchen can accommodate those with allergies by modifying the menu, creating different dishes for those in need.    Courses are spaced out well, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without rushing. Servers do an expectedly nice job explaining what is served. Sommelier wine recommendations have always seemed to work just fine for us. Sometimes a bottle is nice to have with dinner or with meals like the Signature Menu which as many different type courses, a mix of white and reds throughout the meal works even better.    During our recent meal, everything went smoothly and we had a lovely evening. Can't complain about any of the courses served, all of which were refined, demonstrating knowledge of ingredients and skill in the kitchen. In fact, with the open kitchen concept, you can watch the chef directing his team who manage dish preparation who then pass off dishes to the team of service staff, who bring out and introduce your dishes in a timely and seamless manner.    Of the courses tried during this meal, most memorable were the La Truffle Blanche, a soft boiled egg on golden pearl risotto, topped with white alba truffle that was very fragrant and strongly flavoured. We also adored Le Foie Gras, a pan fried duck foie gras served with a vibrant Japanese grape. This was a beautiful balance of flavours, a wonderful course.    As part of the Signature Menu you choose between two mains. We tried one each, they were both excellent. La Caille was very, very good. The free-range quail natural flavours were wonderful and accentuated nicely with foie gras. Le Boeuf, was a serving of two Wagyu beef strips and artichoke heart. Chef recommends the beef at medium rare and best to take your order this way. The fats are released nicely, adding tremendous flavour to the beef, just chew slowly and enjoy. The artichoke was strong and delicious, it combined nicely with the wagyu. This was another great course serving. Yet, we both felt that the wagyu and artichoke were so very good on their own that eating them together made for a bit of a distraction - a nice little problem to have in the end.    Our meal concluded with dessert, excellent coffee and petit four. We left feeling that everything had gone just as expected with excellent service, beautiful and delicious courses and an overall rewarding meal experience, one will no doubt look forward to enjoying again in the future."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,An exaggerated reputation?,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is without a doubt one of the most recognized French restaurants in the world. This one in Hong Kong is split into two areas, one with bar table seating and the other with regular table seating.    I chose the regular table area, where the small portion menu, which is exclusively available at the bar table, was not offered. Throughout the meal, the most of the foods were average and nothing particularly memorable.  Food was not bad, but it was of such quality that you'd forget what you'd eaten a week later.    Dishes were introduced briefly and rapidly. I also overheard the conflicts of staffs occasionally.    I won't say I'll never return, but there should be a strong reason for me to do so in the future."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Striking experience,"The decor was dark and striking, with dark walls and seats. Food was excellent, with the dessert winning the prize."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,米芝蓮三星法國🇫🇷菜,"第一次來吃晚餐，試了signature set  無論食材、烹調方法、味道和食物精緻度也很好，非常滿意的一餐。    頭盤是imperial caviar  滿滿的一份caviar ，下面放了高湯啫喱和蟹肉，味道鮮甜美味。    Pan-seared scallop with green curry and coriander sauce , squid ink farfalle  日本帶子鮮甜無比。外面和裏面也煎得剛剛好，不會過熟。    Hokkaido sea urchin fregola with saffron  海膽fregola （珍珠麵）有濃濃的海膽味，加上黑松露，味道更有層次。    Grilled lobster served with green peas and wasabi  龍蝦肉外面卷著煙肉。  龍蝦肉肉非常厚，味道很鮮甜。煙肉有一點油膩，wasabi 剛好可以減淡油膩感。    Pan seared Japanese wagyu beef with eggplant and turmeric condiment  和牛油脂分布平均，入口即化。  唯一是我點了medium rare ，有一點過於油膩，和牛還是煎熟一點油膩感才不會太重。    只訂到bar 枱位置，也不會不舒服。staff 服務非常有禮及周到。  喜歡吃法國菜的人，建議一試。  有機會想吃其他國家的robuchon 。"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,One of my favourites,"Joël Robuchon is one of my favourite French restaurants in Hong Kong.    Both my friend and I enjoyed our lunch very much. Even though I’ve been there many times, I still find the food consistently good. And I usually find something new which I like.    Everything (amuse bouche, entrée, soup, main course, dessert and mignardises) was delicious. I particularly liked my main course, grilled Challans duck with cherry confit, almonds and girolles. The meat was incredibly tender and the skin crispy. The famed mashed potato which came with the dish was so good that I couldn’t resist finishing it all.    It’s necessary to book well in advance. But, it’s worth the trouble and the wait especially when I still can’t travel to France due to the pandemic."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Exquisite,"It’s been a while since I write about this wonderful place even if I go there at least 10 times a year...  I absolutely love this place: the place itself modern, refined and chic.. every details is thought of!  The service is perfect friendly and efficient.  I love open kitchens and I like to see all the staff cooking and paying attention to every tiny details in order to make the customer happy to discover first a scenery..  The dishes are exquisite : seasoned, Perfectly cooked.  I like that the chef go to the tables to introduce himsel and check if everything is doing well.  Thank you for these moments of pure happiness.    Happy French customers who will relocate soon to Portugal"

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Excellent lunch,"An excellent lunch - only 3 set lunches available due to virus, but the food and overall experience was excellent.  Starting from under HKD 600 this actually was very good value for money - considering most of the other western options in Hong Kong fall short of the mark this will my new go to place - had not been for some years. Recommended."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,40,Four courses lunch - technique and precision,"J. Robuchon is a Michelin 3-star restaurant in HK and has international footprint. Due to such renowned chef I have very high expectations    Starting from making reservation I must say the restaurant didn’t disappoint The hostess was quick and polite in responding guests’ requests.    Walking into the restaurant , it was a consistent black and red deco. The bar facing the kitchen allows guests to have a peep over all the happenings in the busy kitchen.    We ordered the four courses lunch set.    The amuse bouch - very impressed . It tasted wow. Pure wow. I couldn’t recall the exact dish - it was a fish tartar with fish roe, crisp and edible gold . That sauce omg was devine. I wish I have jotted note of the dish on the spot.    The starter - ravioli. I found this dish was ok, not wow . Given it was ravioli with lobster , taste wise it couldn’t go wrong. The ravioli was not the traditional one, rather it was a few ravioli sheets assembled into a mini tower packaging the lobster.    The soup - dashi. Wow ! I could taste the dashi but it was rather subtle and not as distinct as the usual dashi stock.    The main - chicken. Again wow wow wow. I am very impressed with the technique. The chicken was pan fried crispy, it must have been slow cooked in water bath , it was so moist. The foie gras wrapped inside added to the moisture . I would have liked a tad more of the foam or sauce tho.    Dessert - Mont Blanc. . Whenever I have the opportunity I would defo order this dessert as it is incredibly troublesome and time consuming to make. That butterfly crisp and the precision, so good.    Petite four - I was impressed again by the precision and the tiny details on even the petite fours . Amazing .    Last note on the service - give it was a 3 Michelin star restaurant I must say I am not impressed. The service was professional yet a bit standoff-ish and robotic. I ordered a glass of wine but I felt uneasy when I asked to taste a second wine . One of the my friend tasted 6 different bottles when she just ordered two glasses in one of the top restaurants in Sydney and yet the sommelier didn’t have any attitude. I don’t mean the restaurant should allow guests to taste wine in an unreasonable manner but the restaurant should never give the guest an welcome feeling.    I will defo revisit the restaurant to try other dishes on the menu and will defo come back for that luxurious tasting menu."

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon,50,Leisurely weekday lunch,"During my previous visits to L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, I’d always dined at the section with separate tables. However, when I called in late October, only bar seats would be available on the date I wished to book.    It turned out the bar seats were still very comfortable. Due to the current restaurant capacity restriction, there’s more than ample space between the seats.    Both my friend and I took the 4-couse lunch menu. Everything, from amuse bouche to mignardises, was delicious. Even the cappuccino was very good.    My friend took the egg with Alba white truffle as appetiser (with a supplement). When the staff took the white truffle from the wooden box, we immediately smelt the unique aroma, which was much stronger than that of the white truffle we’d at 208 Duecento Otto last week. Autumn is the best season for chestnut soup and it didn’t disappoint. I generally don’t like lukewarm food and on the recommendation of the staff I chose the braised Wagyu beef cheek as main course. It’s nicely executed and the meat was very flavourful and so tender that it literally fell apart when I cut it softly. Both the Mont Blanc and chocolate desserts were divine.    The service was impeccable. The staff were very knowledgeable about the ingredients and dishes.    Top dining experience which lived up to the Robuchon name and the 3-star status."

Spring Moon,50,The old lady is still alive and in a great shape,"Presumably the best Peking duck in the world even if, now, you have to prepare your pancakes by yourself 🤬  The drunken prawns seem to be alive in your mouth since they are so fresh  Perfect service and one of the most impressive cellar in HKG  A wonderful experience"

Spring Moon,10,Awful experience,"Awful experience, low quality food especially their seafood soups. Any streetfood restaurant in HK is better than this. Does not worth at all their one Michelin star"

Spring Moon,50,Impressive and a memorable dining experience for Chinese cuisine!,Great foods - both in taste and presentation. Service is professional and attentive. Ambient is classy and cozy. Definitely live up to the reputation of Peninsula Hotel in HK.  You should expected to pay the price for this kind of quality but still worth it compared to alot of other restaurants in HK that charge you top dollar and not even that good ...

Spring Moon,20,Stilted service and average food at a very high price point.,"Before a recent visit to Hong Kong, I was searching for places to experience the fine dining experience Hong Kong is renowned for. One of the places which kept getting mentioned was Spring Moon. Located in the Peninsula Hotel, the restaurant certainly looked the part and all of the staff who helped me find the restaurant were fantastic, however I found the service in the restaurant to be very stilted and unwelcoming (I was dining solo, but did not find this to be an issue at other Hong Kong restaurants). The food was average and at the price point being charged average is not good enough.    I had the marinated wagyu beef cheek with soy, the roasted pigeon with osmanthus and double layer steamed milk with bird’s nest and kumquat. The osmanthus with the roasted pigeon was delicious, however there needed to be more of it. The kumquat also added very nicely to the steamed milk with bird’s nest but again why be so stingy with it?"

Spring Moon,50,Traditional Cantonese Cuisine at the Peninsula - One Michelin Star,"A Saturday night dinner to try out the Chinese cuisine at the Peninsula. Having done a staycation at the Peninsula in the not too distant past I confess I didn’t have any particularly high expectations for this dinner. Even more so - unfairly - having recently been sorely disappointed by T’ang Court.    Their Char Siu had to be pre ordered (due to its popularity). We started with this and happily I can understand why it is popular and a signature dish. Rather than roasting with a barbecue style sauce this is roasted with honey. The honey offers a slightly sweeter note but works nonetheless. The pork itself was perhaps a little too fatty - but you do need some fat on good char siu - so can be forgiven. The meat was beautifully tender and the execution pretty much flawless. Spring Moon gets my vote for the best char sir in town.    We also opted for their xiao long bao which at 120 HKD a pop was pricy. It was good but not THAT good - the flavouring of the stock a little too subtle and hence lacked a bit of punch.    Amongst our other dishes:    Wok seared Lobster and scallops tossed with seasonal Chinese greens in an XO sauce. Bags of flavour with little bulbs of - I believe goji berries - adding sweet taste sensations. This was a brilliantly executed dish.    Hairy crab meat tossed with tofu cubes accompanying deep fried shrimp/prawn toast. The hairy crab was the main draw here but after the lobster and its full-on flavour this dish was perhaps a touch too subtle. If this had been served before the the lobster it would have worked I suspect. The toast was fantastic adding a different texture to the dish.    Pumpkin with preserved vegetables and Bak Choy Stems. Effective albeit slightly heavy due to the size of the pumpkin pieces - the preserved veg added a somewhat nostalgic note.    Our dessert was a sublime double-layer steamed milk with bird’s nest and kumquat. I don’t usually rave about Chinese desserts as I am used to Western style desserts and ordinarily I can’t find a meaningful comparison. This dessert was, however, heavenly. It’s light soft texture without being overly sweet was balanced and thoroughly enjoyable. Perversely - for a dessert - it felt healthy which only really adds to its mystique. Absolutely loved it.    The steamed red date cake falls into the category of Chinese desserts mentioned before. ie OK - nothing to write home about.    Although full, Spring Moon offered a relaxed and calm ambience - its high ceilings allowing the normal cacophony of sound to dissipate. Service was attentive, helpful and focussed.    All in all a highly enjoyable meal with Spring Moon offering a more than creditable experience which I rank above many other - starred - Chinese restaurants in town."

Spring Moon,20,One of the most disappointing Michelin Cantonese Restaurant,"Although I had great expectations for Spring Moon, which is operated by the renowned luxury brand Peninsula, it was one of the most disappointing Michelin-starred dining experiences I've ever had, both in terms of food quality and service.    I ordered a half portion of their famous barbecued Hungarian pork from and their Spring Moon Degustation Menu. Most of the courses were completely unsatisfactory. The pork was too salty, the double-boiled soup was tasteless, the fried crab shell was soggy, and the fried rice was sticky.    The service was likewise on the low side. I wouldn't say the staff were rude, but you'd get far better service in similar priced Cantonese restaurants like Lung King Heen, Man Wah, and others. Each staff served a large number of tables, and guests were given little attention. There was no introduction to any of the dishes, and their duty was little more than delivering and collecting dishes.    This is one of the few restaurants where I would likely not return."

Spring Moon,10,Double charged,"On 18 Aug 2021, I ordered a birthday cake at Spring Moon, The Peninsula Hotel and settled the pre-payment on 20 Aug 2021. Afterward, I received an acknowledgement that the prepayment for the birthday cake has been debited from my given credit card account. However, it was mentioned in the email that “incidental charge will be settled by cash or credit after the event”. Then, I clarified the statement to the restaurant as my prepayment has been settled and I did find that amount be debited in my banking record. The restaurant then confirmed that the payment had been charged successfully and no need to settle twice.  What is so disappointed that I paid after the dinner on 24 Aug 2021. I realized that they did charge me again for that birthday cake. The next morning, I sent an email requesting a refund of the repeated charge. I have waited the whole morning, but the restaurant did not respond. Then, I can only call their hotline to request a refund! It is unbelievable that this would happen in a so-called five-star hotel restaurant.  Finally, the representative of the restaurant called me back after. They claimed that they did make the mistake of the double charge. I asked if they always ask for pre-payment for the pre-order of cakes, how did this error happen. However, the representative sounded very unprofessional, and they did not know the reason for this mistake. In addition, the refund will have to wait 1 month to get it back!! This kind of service is unacceptable!!! They charge me in a very efficient way. However, refund procedure is surprisingly slow. I totally feel being cheated! If I trusted them so much and did not check the receipt after the dinner, I would never find out that it was charged twice! I completely lost my trust in them now!"

Spring Moon,50,Grand dishes with professional service,"Grand dishes with professional service, typically Chinese interior design, welcoming and friendly staffs serving tasty food, we picked chefs recommendation lunch set which shows the creative and high skill of the chefs, so yummy and worth in price. That’s why spring moon is the well known Michelin stars restaurant in city. Thankfully We had a great pleasure dinning especially in hard time of the days."

Spring Moon,30,Not bad,I’d business lunch at Spring Moon this afternoon.    We all took the Chef’s Tasting Lunch Set Menu. There’s quite a lot of food and I was full in the end.    No single dish stood out. The food was decent on the whole but I could taste MSG.    The service was professional and discreet. I like the way they covered my food until it’s served in front of me.    We’re seated in a room where there’re a few other tables. It’s much more quiet than last time when our table was in the main dining area.

Spring Moon,50,Best Dim Sum in Hong Kong,"Having dined at some of the other Michelin started Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong, this is my favourite. The Dim Sum menu is classic, rather than a modern/new twist. The flavours are superb, and all in all it is by far and away my favourite Dim Sum location in Hong Kong. Strongly recommend!"

Spring Moon,40,Excellent Dim Sum,"The décor of the restaurant is traditional but elegant and stylish.    Dim Sum selection is ok but of course a lot less than other local Chinese restaurants.    We have pan-fried glutinous rice with egg, steamed rice flour rolls with shrimps, baked barbecued pork puffs with honey, steamed scallop dumplings and steamed Sicilian shrimp and minced pork dumpling. They all taste excellent and food quality is top of Hong Kong.  Service is friendly. The prices are quite high but they are all worth the money."

Spring Moon,50,Very talented dim sum chef,"Not my first time trying dim sum creation by the young talented Chef Cheuk.    First time trying the veggie dumpling with Purple sweet potato which is a very nice creation. Together with those classic dishes like shrimp dumpling, taro with abalone, barbecued pork, and of course the award-winning rice roll with shrimp (look that photo!!!) are all heavenly good.    Very busy lunch service period but the service level was still well maintained. People are well trained with very decent food recommendations and product knowledge.    Love to come more often but sadly I moved office to another side of the harbour."

Spring Moon,40,Recommended,"Visited Spring Moon with family in May and it is a traditional restaurant with historic decoration. I just love the vintage color-glass door in the restaurant. Just a bit noisy as the restaurant was busy, but for sure, it may be a good news, especially under the critical COVID-19 situation.    Offered a wide range of different Chinese cuisine and highly recommend the Crispy Chicken Smoked with Tea Leaves and the Smoked BBQ Mangalica Pork with Honey. Both delicious and unique. For desserts, the Almond Cream with Egg White and the Chinese Petite Four are also my recommendations.    For services, to my experience, one of the staff, Tony responsed to my feedback on one of the dishes promptly and it gave out a great impression on taking guest's comments seriously as well as a true follow-up on guest's advice. Good Job!    I am sure will visit to Spring Moon again and will recommend my friends as well."

Spring Moon,20,Dim sums no good at all vs Fook Lam Moon and Cusine Cusine,I had dinner and lunch there during the past week. Dishes for dinner are of poor quality a today’s dim sums - dumpling with prawns (too much msg)  deep fried roll with ube (not soft at all and in fact it’s hard)  Pig knuckle with ginger in dark vinegar (soso sweet)  Regret that I was there wasting my time

Spring Moon,50,"Top level service, top quality dishes","Our lunch at Spring Moon was exceptional, with superb recommendations from Mr. Noi. We had some very good dim sum that were well-presented in appetizing shapes and designs, very unique. The Cantonese dishes were excellent tasting with obviously fresh vegetables and ingredients. We were well-attended to in English with professional and sincere service all around from Mr. Noi and the other restaurant staff despite the restaurant being full and very busy. The concierge was also able to arrange the restaurant booking even though it was fully booked to accommodate our preferences. Thank you for an excellent time."

Spring Moon,40,Great service,"As my friend working in Peninsula, we may sometimes gather there for dinner. The service here is always great and attentive. The spacious environment provides us with a comfortable and relaxing time to chit chat. One of my friends is vegetarian and also finds the dishes here great. Nice people, nice environment, nice food and nice wine!"

Spring Moon,40,Good food and great ambiance,"This Michelin 1-star Chinese restaurant is located in The Peninsula Hong Kong, with most people probably heard about their famous custard mooncake. With a luxurious yet comfortable and inviting setting, the staff greeted us warmly and showed us to a table at the end of the restaurant, where we can see an interesting tea-bar corner featuring many teapots and cupboards containing premium tea leaves.    We ordered a la carte for night, with me starting with Hot and Sour King Crab Meat Soup ($260), while my wife had the Double-Boiled Fresh 6-Head Abalone with Polygonatum Root and Liquorice Root ($380). My soup is very tasty, with lots of ingredients including shredded sea cucumber, conpoy, shiitake mushroom, scallop, and chunks of king crab meat. While flavorful, I wish they can dial up on the sourness and spiciness, which would make it even more wonderful.    Next we had Pan-fried Garoupa with Top Soy Sauce ($780). This one is my favorite in the meal, with the fish fillet golden brown in colour, decorated with some poplar mushroom and scallion. The soy sauce is not salty, but giving a great savory note to the fish, perfect in harmony and so good that we quickly finished a few pieces before the rice can come. A good dish I would recommend.    Upon the recommendation of the staff we ordered the Chicken Smoked with Tea Leaves ($300). The chef also helped to remove the bones to make it easier to eat too. The skin is slightly crispy, with a delicate tea fragrance. The flesh on other hand is a bit salty, and probably because of the smoking process also is a bit dry. If you want a dish with silky smooth texture for the chicken this will not be your choice but nonetheless still a good dish.    Another interesting dish we ordered is Lotus Root Patties with Oyster ($330). Unlike the normal lotus root patties, this one has added pieces of chopped oyster, creating an original and creative blend of flavors which I found complementary and harmonious. The patties also got a great texture, with the crunchy lotus root mixing with the soft oyster and pork to add another enjoyment to the dish. Worth to try it out.    On dessert I had the Mango Pudding ($85) while my wife had the Red Bean Soup ($138). The pudding is decent, and as the mango is not of the right season they are not particularly good, but that is kind of expected. I think it might be good to provide the evaporated milk however, to give a bit of creamy texture to the pudding. Not my favorite unfortunately overall.    There is a petits fours provided which included Ginger and Red Fig Cake as well as Sachima. Both are quite good and serve as a rewarding and fulfilling finale for the meal.    The service has been impeccable, with everyone very friendly, courteous and attentive. Not even once did I need to pour my own tea throughout the night, and they also come to check in with us on the dishes. Again, if only they would spend sometime to explain each dish before serving it would be wonderful. The bill was $2,644 and I would say is reasonable."

L'Envol,50,Excellent meal,"Enjoyed an excellent dinner on a quite shaded terrace. Despite all tables being booked, first class service was provided by the co-owner. Although the menu is limited, quality is top class. Enjoyed the “homard” entree with white beetroot (a real discovery), followed by fish of the day and an exquisite cheese desert. Highly recommended, but reserve in advance!!"

L'Envol,50,Our experience was wonderful.,Sitting out on their terrance was lovely. This was one of if not the best meal and experience we had on our whole trip. The staff and food were marvelous. She explained the dishes and picked wines to accompany the different courses. We recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area.

L'Envol,50,Another perfect dining experience,"Another wonderful evening of fabulous food and fine wine.    The food was beautifully presented and so tasty. From perfectly cooked meat and vegetables, all fabulously fresh to delicious desserts this was another memorable evening.    My dessert was amazing. Combining whipped cream cheese, croutons, sweet caramelised onions and tomatoes, topped with grated goats cheese it was to die for. So clever. All washed down with a local red wine recommendation. Perfect."

L'Envol,50,A fantastic evening out,"Extremely welcoming, wonderful service, fantastic food, great wine, extremely comfortable all evening! I recommend this to anyone for a special evening. I definitely will visit again!"

L'Envol,50,Everything more than perfect!!!,"I seldomly comment or recommend something . In this case I do. From the very begining (reservation) to the end, the warm and highly competent Service and the all around outstanding dishes met and surpass my expectations. Same applies for the vine recommandation. All over perfection paired with family dealing, end in a real experience what I feel as pure happiness. I love to experience Michelin Star Restaurants. L’envol derserves one. Thank you so much for this great evening!"

L'Envol,50,We live in the Luberon and,"We live in the Luberon and eat out A LOT!  With out doubt this husband and wife team turn out a very special experience. It’s a gem of a restaurant, with amazing food and service. We will definitely put this at the top of or list!  It’s a gem"

L'Envol,40,"Wonderful service, very good food",This small restaurant run by a couple with the husband as chef and the wife in service is very good and off the main road. It's quiet and the service is simply superb. The food is very good with some highlights being a delicious octopus gazpacho entree and a very good fish main course. The chocolate dessert was also fine. Prices are fair. Important to book as they service a maximum of 16 people per meal.

L'Envol,50,"Exceptional food, exceptional service!","We had lunch twice at L’Envol and on both occasions everything about the experience was superb. Sarah is a fantastic maitre d’ who provides excellent service. The restaurant offers great value for money as they do a lunch menu for 16 euros which includes a main course, dessert and coffee. We have been so impressed with lunch we’re going for dinner next week. You have to visit this restaurant!!!"

L'Envol,50,Always a special experiance,This small restaurant with the owner as chef and the wife in service is a gem. I only can recommend this place. Very high standard in the kitchen and quite affordable.

L'Envol,50,Excellent food and service!,Excellent food made with love and passion! Very nice and serviceminded owners ! The very best restaurant in Cavaillon!

L'Envol,50,if you are in Cavaillon and enjoy your food and wine this is the place to go - no question!,"Run by a husband a wife team this really is an outstanding restaurant. - the amuse bouche were amazing, the choice of food and the standard of it was simply excellent and that was starters, mains and desert . the wine list is considerable but the knowledge of each wine and its origins and qualities was impressive. so if you only have one meal in Cavaillon go to L'emvol you will not regret it."

L'Envol,50,Very good restaurant and highly recommend,"The restaurant is managed by a couple. Delicious food with very good service in French, German and English (at least). Nice ambiance. Ingredients are local fresh products, thus the menu varies with season."

L'Envol,50,A Diamond Not to be missed,"We booked dinner at the restaurant in advance and just as well as potential diners were turned away whilst we ate. Don’t let the location of a back street put you off!    The current owners (Sara and Laurent - front of house and chef respectively) limit the number of diners to 16 or 17 in order to ensure delivery of great food. The menu is limited to choices of three options for each course and provides something for everyone. We ate crevettes, escargot and pan fried fois gras all with delicious sauces; mains were steak, pintade ( guinea fowl) and fish ( a cousin of sea bream) again with great sauces. The plates of food were full of delicious flavours and very well balanced. Deserts were not a disappointment either with chocolate a la maison and pear william.    The wine list is not extensive but there was a good selection of local wines and those (white and red) suggested by Sara were very good indeed and quite reasonably priced (about E30 each). Our bill cane to about E65 per head and was worth every Euro!    Sara and Laurent have been running their restaurant for about two years now and they deserve to be successful. We would definitely return if we are back in this area."

L'Envol,50,Exceptional!,"The restaurant is managed by a lovely couple, and both the food and the service are of the highest order.  We ordered the beef steak and the fish and both were delightful.  The host was super nice and even helped us with interesting places to visit.  This restaurant is a must visit!!"

L'Envol,50,Nice surprise,"Many restaurants close in Provence in the winter, and we struggled to find one. Luckily we found L’Envol. The setting is simple but well done, the food was excellent, and a wonderful and pleasant hostess and server. She and the chef made our meal one to remember and we will return."

L'Envol,50,Wonderful Cuisine and the Warmest Welcome,"Run by a charming and very talented young couple L'Envol is an absolute joy. A chef who really knows his business and a wonderful welcome from his lovely wife. We have been twice for "" boys lunch club"" in this their first year. It's fair...More"

L'Envol,50,Great food and service,"I last visited the location where L’Envol is located two years ago, and found its predecessor, Carte sur Table, to be excellent. In truth, when I rang to reserve a table, that’s where I thought I was booking again (I must listen more carefully) so...More"

L'Envol,50,Deserving of its reputation,"We were recommended this place by our b&b and it did not disappoint. Food was delicious and the wonderful host, Sarah, was warm and friendly, which completed the experience. This is what dining in France should be like!"

L'Envol,50,Wonderful Cuisine and the Warmest Welcome,"Run by a charming and very talented young couple L'Envol is an absolute joy.  A chef who really knows his business and a wonderful welcome from his lovely wife.  We have been twice for "" boys lunch club"" in this their first year.  It's fair to say that Cavaillon is not the gastronomic centre of France! but this would be outstanding anywhere in the world.  Our wonderful set two course lunch is 16 euros which is fantastic value. Whilst the evening menu is more realistic it is incredible value for money. There are a selection of super wines all again extremely good value. ( Several of us have been for dinner )  I love eating dishes that I do not have the skill, or patience to cook at home and L'Envol fits the bill every time.  We are so pleased that they are doing so well in their first year and we know that they will continue to give such quality and service, however popular they get.  Well done.  A bientot"

L'Envol,50,Great food and service,"I last visited the location where L’Envol is located two years ago, and found its predecessor, Carte sur Table, to be excellent. In truth, when I rang to reserve a table, that’s where I thought I was booking again (I must listen more carefully) so I was a little worried when we arrived and there was a different name over the door.    I had nothing to worry about: L’Envol has followed its predecessor and excelled beyond it, with food and service of the highest order. L’Envol deserves its reputation as the best in Cavaillon, which it achieves through superb ingredients, careful preparation and cooking, and the most friendly and attentive service. I’m sure we’ll return this trip!    Must visit!"

L'Envol,50,Excellent,"We recently stayed for a week near Cavaillon and visited L'Envol twice in that time which gives you an idea of how much we enjoyed this restaurant! The food is outstanding, really delicious. Sarah, front of house, is absolutely charming and very knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommended."

L'Envol,50,Deserving of its reputation,"We were recommended this place by our b&b and it did not disappoint. Food was delicious and the wonderful host, Sarah, was warm and friendly, which completed the experience. This is what dining in France should be like!"

L'Envol,50,Excellent,"Absolutely agree with the previous reviewer. This used to be known as Carte sur Table but has now changed owners. Very professional and extremely tasty. They also deal with problems extremely well, which is much less usual in this part of France. Highly recommend for value for money and delicious cuisine."

L'Envol,50,Excellent find,"We live nearby (Lacoste) and have struggled to find a decent restaurant in Cavaillon. l'Envol is a very welcome arrival and already ranks among our top choices for the entire region. The welcome and service are very friendly and professional - as good as it gets. The decor is calm, pleasing and comfortable. The food is outstanding - I have lunched there twice in the past two weeks. The lunch formule of one main and one dessert (no choices) for 15 euros is terrific value. There is also a short a-la-carte menu with I think three starters, three mains and three desserts. On the first visit the formule was lapin farcie, the second a superb pintade. This is cooking and service to a very high standard without being pretentious. You will not be disappointed."

Amber,50,Four Hands Dinner - Amber x Syrco Basé,"Best Experience! Best Cuisine! Best Service!  4 Michelin Stars + 1 Green Michelin Star!    It was an unforgettable experience in Amber the Landmark Mandarin Oriental. My friend and I booked a table for 2 in Amber for a special Four Hands Dinner of Amber x Syrco BASE in 13 Courses menu. I really enjoyed the new concept of Amber restaurant after the renovation.  (Amber's progressive menu showcases pure flavours, masterful techniques and chef Richard Ekkebus's creative vision. Taking a thoughtful approach to fine dining, the new menu dispenses with dairy products, minimises refined sugar and reduces salt.  Diners appreciate the flavours in their purest form.)    Needless to say the guest chef Syrco created an amazing & interesting menu with the combination of Dutch & Indonesian flavours. My favourite dishes are the Pigeon Kobocha Foie Gras from Amber and the Grouper Turmeric Cabbage from Syrco BASE. Looking forward to the new restaurant Syrco BASE opening in Bali in Q4 2023. I will definitely recommend these two restaurants for everyone."

Amber,50,A must visit Michelin-starred Restaurant. Top-notch service. Fantastic food in splendid presentation.,"This is our second time having lunch at Amber. Every time being here has left us the best memories.  Relaxing ambiance, top-notch service and quality food. The food is seasonal and always fantastic with splendid presentation.  We throughly enjoyed every aspect of the lunch arrangement. Staffs were delightful and very considerate. A big thumb up to the entire staffs for making my friend’s birthday distinctive and memorable.  We’ll definitely be back again and love to recommend Amber to everyone."

Amber,50,Exellent Service and food!!!,We celebrated our 10th Anniversary here. The food was excellent. The staff who served us explained the food very well. That was the best Anniversary Celebration I ever had

Amber,50,Wonderful experience,A delightful experience. Excellent service and attention to every details. Food are amazing. Highly recommend 8 course menu with kitchen experience.

Amber,50,Extraordinary Amber experience!! Highly recommended.,非常好的體驗。食物水準極高而且菜式獨特。服務一流。Amber team 非常專業地用心為顧客服務，務求顧客有完美的用餐體驗。非常感激！    The Amber team was professional and has served us the most delicate dishes. Food was undoubtedly good and the hospitality of the team made the complete fabulous experience.  We were celebrating birthday at Amber and the team offered us the birthday cake which we did not expected at first and we really appreciate their warm move.

Amber,50,Great birthday celebration experience,Great experience. The food was speechless delicious. They were so warm to provide us birthday surprise. Highly recommend couples to have anniversary celebration there.

Amber,50,Iconic as always,"As one of the most iconic fine dining restaurants in Hong Kong, Amber is also one of my top favourite restaurants. I have had some many special occasions here - for birthday, for work celebration and etcetc. Amber by Chef Richard Ekkebus has also been proudly recognised for 15 consecutive years with two Michelin-stars and The Michelin Green Star since 2022. The consistency of delivering a high quality dining experience is just incredible. I had my 5th Amber experience lately and it was amazing. The kitchen experience of the Full Amber Experience menu was such a highlight! I love the ""immersive"" and interactive experience- the Amber team would showcase how they curated the dish in front of you and share about the philosophy. I just couldn't wait to be back again!"

Amber,50,Enjoyable and spectacular! Will definitely visit again,"Great atmosphere, amazing and delicious fine dining experience with excellent service. Especially love the unique dining experience that the team offers as a surprise on the menu"

Amber,50,Very nice fine dining restaurant. Worth the price tag.,We had an amazing dinner here. Highly recommend the full amber experience menu. Superb service. Smiley staff. Will definitely be here again.

Amber,40,A pleasant week day lunch,"It is worth returning to Amber after so many years. We find the renovated restaurant venue impressive.    Service staff observe the rules well. They are attentive without being intrusive and the introduction of dishes is thorough and they speak at just the right speed.    The food is OK, not outstanding, but one can tell that they put thought into creating all different courses. We tried the Full Amber Experience in order to savour as many courses as possible.    The course worth mentioning is the very last one, a fruit platter with sweet temptations on the side. This is unique amongst all other top restaurants; we give them full marks for it.    It was a pleasant lunch experience but we hope that they would enforce the dress code. We saw too many pairs of sneakers, though I am sure there would be many voices speaking against us."

Amber,50,It doesn’t get old,"Seems that in Amber they have created the golden balance of fine dining, never gets old, never gets degraded. Menu was slightly different this time but it all amounted to the same elevated experience, we keep returning perpetually."

Amber,50,Place to do decent lunch on a weekend. Relaxing lunch,Excellent service  Good good with pairing wine    It is one of the impressive dining experience of the year 2023

Amber,50,"It was worth it, will come back again in the future",Great for couples and also business purposes. The ambience is super calm for HK standard which I loved. All the waiter and waitress master all of the menu and can explain it in a very detailed manner. Hygiene is 💯 the restaurant was on full house.    We ordered extended amber experience and im super super full! If you have small tummy can go with amber experience and if you are a super foodie then can choose the full amber experience. But remember to spare at least 2 hours to enjoy everything

Amber,50,Attention all foodies - next level Wow!,Over the past 14 years we have usually dined at Amber on our wedding anniversary. The past few years have been the exception with renovations then covid and closures.    The renovation has changed the vibe from dimly lit and romantic to light and elegant.    A new addition to the full degustation menu is the opportunity to experience one course in the kitchen. This is a game changer. The organisation and precision timing required to offer this experience apart from what must be an intrusion to the sanctity of the Chef’s kitchen is truly special. Scenes from the movie The Menu did cross my mind…!    Incredible food as always. Chef Ekkebus is a super star.

Amber,50,Perfect dinning exp for celebration,"Amazing full amber experience, we are lucky to get a table for early valentine’s celebration to avoid the crowd! Interesting experience to visit the kitchen! Food is delicious as expected and staff are smart that we must be full for petit four so pack for home to enjoy next day!"

Amber,50,Family Reunion Treat,"Due to the pandemic we have not met our family for 3 years and when they came to visit Hong Kong we decided to spoil them by choosing Amber.    We went for the “ Full Experience Menu ” and enjoyed one of the dishes in the Amber kitchen and were able to see what was happening behind the scenes.    We enjoyed all the dishes in particular the uni sea urchin. And we had a cake to take home, what a lasting memory all of us!    Thank you Laura and her team's hospitality."

Amber,30,Nice hsbc deal,"Hsbc buy 1 get 1  Around 1700 per head with the new kitchen experience  Michelin 2 stars  Decent portion  Nth much to complain  the food is alright  Average among the Michelin stars in hk  They hav the same problem like many restaurants  Which start off with all these fancy and ethereal starters , then everythg starts to go downhill  With fish being overcooked and jus with overpower flavours"

Amber,50,Amazing Amber 👍,"This is our first time to visit Amber to celebrate my daughter’s birthday.  An amazing experience for us, really relaxing environment with a great team serving us. Ray clearly explained all the dishes and ingredients to us with patience. I like the tasty Aka Uni while my wife and my daughter love the Haku Farm Wagyu so much.  We are deeply impressed by the surprising birthday cake for my daughter and all the unexpected amenities. All the dishes are showing high quality under the detail mind of the Executive Chef (P.S. my favorite dessert is the madeleine😋), thumbs up !!!"

Amber,20,Bland,"Amber restaurant at Landmark Mandarin.    Well if you like really expensive but slightly refined boring food then this is the place for you.  The tasting menu provides course after course of under seasoned dishes with no depth of flavour.  A very strange and experimental amuse bouche, Cauliflower mousse with no cauliflower flavour. A venison Terrine served with what can only be described as grandma’s chutney was pleasant but unrefined. Under seasoned chewy beef, a chicken dish that was not unpleasant but tasted like a family roast with paxo stuffing.  Ponced up dishes with caviar and truffle try to disguise the insipid gastronomy beneath.  The service was pleasant but clumsy.    Dine and pay at your own peril."

Amber,50,So glad to meet Laura,"So happy to see Laura    We had the full Amber experience again after a year or so and we could just sum it up by saying it is a place worth visiting on any special occasion. Also, we were so glad, when we least expected it, to meet Laura Latry there (now working as director of the restaurant) and to thank her once again for organizing my wife’s birthday party 3 years ago at Pierre, Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong (where she was then working as the restaurant manager) and making it the best party we had ever had with lots of fond memories. Thanks again to Laura and her colleagues both at Pierre (before) and (now) at Amber."

Amber,50,excellent,"perfect dinner with excellent service.  best dish in town - aka uni  highlight - amuse bouche, pigeon are very tender and juices, petit four very refreshing"

Amber,10,Bad reservation experience,"I made a dinner reservation on their online reservation page and have left information at the ""remarks"" box around 2 months in advance, stating that (i) it is for birthday celebration; and (ii) please advise if I can use credit car promotion, but emphasis that I will still keep my reservation no matter the credit card promotion is available or not.  However, I did not receive any feedback until 1 week before the scheduled dinner date, therefore I email the restaurant and only at that time the restaurant realised that they have missed my remarks, and only at that time I was being notified that the credit card offer is not available at my reservation time.  Therefore I have sincerely left a suggestion to them to aware of the customers'remarks. However, there is no feedback and it give me a very strong impression that they tends to ignore customers' opinion in an extremely arrogant attitude, especially when compared with the reservation experiences at other restaurants with similar grading.  I am totally disappointed and have black-listed the restaurant, especially there are plenty of restaurants who will treat customers opinion seriously."

Amber,50,Great birthday!,"The great thing about Amber is that you know you will be treated well and then they outdo it!  Went here with my family for my birthday dinner.  Excellent service with a lot of patience from the sommelier and those attending our table to meet our requirements.  The food was fantastic, delightfully laid out; appeasing to the eye.  We loved being there and will be back soon.  The review would be incomplete without thanking Ray Leung. Sebas Vis and Jordon Wong for all their help and being attentive to our palate and requirements. Thank you."

Amber,50,"Fabulous Food with Art Piece Presentation, Excellent Service & Fantastic Environment","We went there for a casual dinner and all food were presented like art piece. Service was very good, attentative but yet not made you feel uncomfortable. Thanks so much to Sabash and Ken who did an excellent job. Though it is quite a pricy dinner but I highly recommend as it is really worth to try."

Amber,50,8 course experience,"Amazing time, great service and exceptional food.  We enjoyed the 8 courses experience at Amber. Service is impecable and every dish surprises you in a different way. Definitely a must go place for food lovers! Thanks to Tiffany for making the evening so special. See you soon!"

Amber,50,Lives up to the Michelin expectations,High recommended- we were blown away by the food and the caviar cream egg was the highlight. The only suggested I would make is that the light is too bright and a darker ambience would have been nice.

Amber,50,Good experience again after 6.5 years,"Checking my records, the last time I visited this Michelin 2-star restaurant was back in Jan 2016. I cannot believe it is already 6.5 years since. Arriving at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental this evening, with the hotel now becoming a quarantine hotel, we have to take the elevator in the mall to go up to the restaurant.    Passing through the big sliding door, the staff shows us to our table, a spacious and comfortable curved booth seat, offering good intimacy for conversation while looking out to the windows to the dense building skyline. The décor is different from my last visit, with warmer and brighter lighting, a more approachable ambience. The iconic golden rods suspension from the ceiling is also replaced by bronze rings chandelier. Overall, I like this new design better than the previous one.    Starting with some aperitif, I have picked RL Legras Presidence Vieilles Vignes 2013 ($364), a grand cru Blanc de Blancs champagne, with wonderfully refreshing acidity and citrus notes, while my wife, on the recommendation from the sommelier, opted for Lyre’s Classico ($188), an interesting non-alcoholic sparkling from Australia.    We decide to go for the Full Amber Experience ($2,608), and I also asked the sommelier to pick a few wines to pair with the course. The amuse bouche consists of two items, the first being Butter Mushroom Panna Cotta. Some black truffle paste is hidden beneath the thickened cream of the panna cotta, with some thinly sliced crunchy celtuce on top to give a contrast in texture. The chef also adds some parsnip oil on top to increase the complexity in flavors. A good starter.    The other amuse bouche, Foie Gras Lollipop, is a signature of the restaurant. The creamy and tasty foie gras is wrapped with a layer of raspberry gel, to provide the perfect pairing between savory and sweetness. Decorated as two leaves are beetroot and gingerbread. The creative presentation as a lollipop is not just great on appearance, it is also good in taste. My pick among the two amuse bouche.    To start off with the first few courses, the sommelier recommends me to pair with a sake. From Saga, Nabeshima Junmai Ginjo 鍋島純米吟醸 きたしずく ($358) has a delicate, balanced sweetness and umami note, with a slight fizzy sensation, going well with the first couple of dishes featuring Japanese raw ingredients. This brewery has been getting a lot of attention and recently become one of the most sought-after sakes.    The first course is Yellow Tail, or Hamachi in Japanese. The chef has cut a few slices of the fish in sashimi style and cured in sake for 24 hours to soften the texture, and then served with sorrel to give a nice herbal fragrance with acidity. The green sauce is made from green apple, cucumber, and Jalapeno to give a bit of kick, together with also Colatura di Alici, a kind of Italian fish sauce made from anchovies, and monocultivar Frantoio extra virgin olive oil. Together with sliced tomatillo, the complexity of flavors brings extra dimensions to the sashimi, with vibrant acidity to appease the appetite. A great starter.    The second course is Aka Uni. The red sea urchin is from Hokkaido, and I still remember having this same signature dish many years ago. The chef created layers of cauliflower, lobster, with a nice dashi soy sauce jelly, with an unbelievably abundance of premium Daurenki Schrenki caviar on top with some gold flakes to decorate. Scooping all the way down, each spoon is a treat in pure luxurious enjoyment, with the umami notes of the caviar, the different sweetness of the lobster and sea urchin, the creamy texture of the cauliflower puree. There are also the crispy seaweed crackers to go on the side. No wonder this is still on the menu after all these years and remains diners’ favorite.    Moving on to the second wine, it is the one I like most in the evening, the quite rare Domaine A Lady A 2018 ($450), a Sauvignon Blanc from a tiny plot of 1 hectare in the famous winery in Tasmania. With lots of fruit including peach, gooseberry, and melon, plus also the signature and well-integrated grassy characters, it goes well with the peas coming next.    The third course is Duck Foie Gras with Sugar Snap Pea. The vibrant green pea shoots and pea flowers provided both a visual and sensory complement to the sweet peas with the nice poppy texture. On top of the foie gras is a jelly prepared with the Spanish white wine from Rias Baixas, together with some lemon verbena to give acidity and lemony taste in the sauce. On the side are some white onion crisps, with intense flavors that match the dish nicely.    The third wine paired is Philippe Bouzereau Chateau de Citeaux Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Pasquelles 2017 ($400). With refreshing acidity and nice minerality on the aftertaste, it goes well with the seafood dishes in the next two courses.    Before the next course we are served the sourdough, freshly baked from the oven, with a crunchy surface while soft in the body. The bread itself is very good, but even better is the French olive oil that comes with for dipping, having a nice nutty note, fresh and delicate.    The fourth course is Blue Lobster from Brittany, with the chef complementing the very sweet and tasty lobster meat with slices of kabu, or Japanese turnips, as well as salicornia, to have a contrast in texture from the vegetables. The sauce is probably the essence on this dish though, with Daurenki Tsar Imperial caviar and chives added to the cultured nut butter, seasoned with grilled almond oil and the pearl-like caviar lime for its acidity. Another great dish.    The fifth course is Arakabu Yaki or pan-seared scorpion fish. The thick piece of the fillet indicated the size of the fish, with the skin grilled nicely, crispy and aromatic, together with some premium extra virgin Manni olive oil ‘Per Me’. The fish however is very mild in taste, relying on the Bouillabaisse, the intense fish stew that is seasoned with Espelette pepper and Amalfi lemon, to infuse with flavors. On the side is an interesting and delicious dumpling, made with wonton skin and containing aromatic summer vegetable fillings, further dusted with some bottarga on top for its umami taste, and is wonderful in enjoying with the bouillabaisse.    The final wine to pair is Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou 2014 ($673), the renown Bordeaux second growth from Saint-Julien. Very aromatic, with smooth tannin, plenty of black fruit and hints of smoky and savory characters, it is of great match with the beef on the main course.    The sixth course is Arita ‘EMO’ Wagyu. The prized beef coming from Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan has been dried and aged in-house. On the nicely seared beef there are some wagyu beef katsuobushi, the dried beef shavings similar in the way with bonito, which goes well with the juicy, tender beef to enhance the flavors. On the side is a piece of ichijiku, or fig, with also some confit red onion. The tasty sauce is prepared with black garlic together with some pepper berry and aged Shanghai vinegar, providing the perfect complement to the beef. My favorite dish in the evening.    Coming to the dessert, the seventh course is Puffed Black Camargue Rice. Flavored with the inclusion of sake lees, the crunchy texture of the rice puff is memorable, and on top there is the rice milk ice-cream of delicate taste. The raspberry on the side has a nice acidity to freshen up the palate, further complemented with the raspberry vinegar. A good one.    The menu does include coffee or tea, and so I opted for a Double Espresso to go with the upcoming richer chocolate dessert.    The final course features the single origin Conspiracy Dak Lak 90% Bitter Chocolate from Vietnam. With some cacao nibs sprinkled on top, the crunchy flakes from silken tofu and cacao have a nice presentation and is perfect condiment for the sorbet made with fermented cacao mucilage and yuba. I found the chocolate having unique cherry and spicy characters, and while it is dark chocolate it is not as bitter as the other ones I have tried. No wonder this is the chef’s favorite dessert.    For Petits Fours, the first is the Fruit Platter with pineapples, Java apple, and rambutan. The fruit are not the usual ones but highlighted the more regional and seasonal picks which showcased another example of the chef’s philosophy to use local and regional ingredients for his dishes.    The second Petits Fours is Madeleine, the traditional French small sponge cake. The soft texture of the cake and the right level of sweetness is what I like for this one. While it might not look fancy, sometimes the original and simple version does offer the best experience.    The third Petits Fours is Chocolate Mousse, with a chocolate casing holding the smooth, creamy mousse rich in flavors. Decorated with some toasted almond pieces and chocolate shavings, it is the most indulgent of the four.    The last Petits Fours is the Seep Tea but unfortunately by that time I am a bit drunk and cannot remember what exactly it is made with.    Service is good, with the staff friendly and explaining each dish in detail. The sommelier is also professional and able to pair the wines well with the food. The bill on the night is $8,480 and obviously it is not cheap but on the complete dining experience AMBER continues to deliver its promise and justify the Michelin 2-star status. No wonder earning the award 14 years consecutively."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,40,Great wine pairing with welcoming staff,We were impressed by the sommelier called KC. He was very welcoming and served the wine pairing with great match.  The wagyu beef was impressive.  We spent a great night there.

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,20,Very disappointing,"We have fond memories of Yan Toh Heen. However, this transition to Lai Ching Heen leaves a lot to be desired.    We cannot believe that this venue has 2 Michelin Stars. It is painfully obvious that they are understaffed - we had to wait and wait to catch a server's eye for everything - they failed to clear finished plates on time, and hardly had time to pour tea and wine, etc.    The wine list was not offered to us at all, until we asked for it.    We pre-ordered their Peking Duck. The server was evidently not skilled in peeling duck and showed all the awkwardness of inexperience. The taste was average.    The Crispy Lobster Dumpling with Black Truffle was also average; however, the soup-base was very good.    The Wok-seared Rice Flour Cannelloni and Fish Maw was not remarkable either.    The Wok-fried Kagoshima Wagyu and Duck Liver with Spicy Sauce was the worst wagyu beef I have ever had in a top Chinese venue in Hong Kong.    Furthermore, they do not enforce the dress code. At our table, both ladies wore dresses and the gentleman was in a business suit, as we were informed by a strict-sounding member of their Reception team, that this is of great importance (she sounded like a school teacher telling pupils about uniforms). We were told on the phone that the dress code was elegant-casual.    However, when we received the reservation confirmation, the code had changed to smart-casual.    We certainly saw a lot of casual - jeans, worn-out golf shirts and T-shirts one would wear to the wet-markets. If there is no dress code enforcement, why make it so serious?    Other than our table, the only other clients who observed any dress code were three western gentlemen, all in business suits.    We were at a great 2 Michelin Star Chinese restaurant just last week. That restaurant is far superior in every way. Actually, there is no comparison.    I would not recommend this restaurant, which I personally feel is all hype with very little substance."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,40,From Yan Toh Heen to Lai Ching Heen,"This Michelin 2-star restaurant is formerly known as Yan Toh Heen. With the InterContinental closed and re-opened as Regent Hong Kong, this restaurant also re-opened and re-named to Lai Ching Heen, at the exact same location, offering diners a gorgeous view looking out to the Victoria Harbour.    The renovated décor still creates a premium, luxurious yet cozy and comfortable ambience, with the signature use of jade apparent throughout the restaurant, from the plates and utensils to the art pieces and the greenish hues on decorations.    The sommelier introduced a non-alcohol sparkling cocktail for us ($120) which had authentic peach flavours, not too sweet and was a nice refreshing aperitif. The complimentary Amuse Bouche was White Wood-Ear and Cucumber Salad 千島涼拌白木耳脆青瓜. Appetizing and pleasant starter.    Our first course was Barbecued Pork with Honey 蜜汁黑豚叉燒 ($320). A generous portion with two slabs of nicely grilled piece of pork, glistening with honey glaze. The pork was very tender, of the perfect proportion of fat and lean meat, and seeping with juice. I would like it to be a bit more charred but still one of the best Char Siu in town in my opinion.    For the soup, I had Hot and Sour Soup with Tofu and Vegetables 酸辣豆腐雜菜羮 ($210). This was a vegetarian dish, with a nice balance of spicy and sourness, plenty of tofu, corn, mushroom, and stem of choi sum for different bite in texture. A nice deviation from the traditional seafood version.    My wife had Double Boiled Fish Maw and Sea Whelk Soup 花膠燉響螺 ($320). The soup was rich in umami and delicious, with the sea whelk cooked to such tenderness that it showed the soup must have been double boiled for a long while. Unfortunately, the fish maw had a hint of weird notes though.    Next, we each had Golden Stuffed Crab Shell with Crabmeat 脆釀鮮蟹蓋 ($318). The golden-brown crust of the crab meat was highly appealing, with the chef using abundance of red and green crab meat together for the best taste and mouthfeel, together with onion and milk, to make a stuffing that was phenomenal in my opinion. I believe the dish was waiting to be served while we were finishing the soup, and if they could be enjoyed immediately from oven the experience would be even better.    The last time we visited Yan Toh Heen this dish was the most memorable, so we had again Golden Frog Legs with Spicy Salt 椒鹽田雞腿 ($288). Lightly battered before deep-frying, the frog legs had thin crisp surface, tender and flavourful. I also liked how the spicy salt did not over-dominate the taste, just giving that savoury touch to make everything perfect. Still good as always.    The Braised Garoupa Fillet with Ginger and Spring Onion in Soy Bean Paste 麵醬薑蔥生炆斑球 ($680) was served in clay pot, highly aromatic from the spring onion and ginger. The garoupa fillet was very good too, firm with a good bite, seasoned well with the bean paste adding some sweetness and an extra dimension of savoury. The dish also did not feel heavy or excessively oily. Fantastic.    Coming to the dessert, I had picked Baked Sago and Custard Cream Pudding & Taro Paste with Black and White Sesame Roll 奶皇焗西米布甸拼荔蓉鴛鴦芝麻卷 ($82). The pudding was appropriate in sweetness, with the custard less heavy than the traditional lotus paste, but personally I would prefer the latter. The sesame roll was good, and I found it a pity that this dim sum was increasingly difficult to find nowadays because of the tedious works.    My wife had Double Boiled Sweetened Dried Longan Soup with Japanese Ginkgo Nuts and Peach Gum 紅棗桃膠燉日本銀杏 ($88). Decent in taste and also appropriate on sweetness, the delicate and refined flavours were delicious, particularly suitable for the health-conscious who might worry about the sugar in the desserts.    There was also a complimentary Petits Fours including several of the dim sum like Hawthorn Roll, Sesame Ball with Custard, Mango Mochi, Lotus Paste Puff and Mini Mooncake. Delicate in appearance and good in taste, this assortment was a good combination of different traditional delicacies and a joyful completion of this wonderful dinner.    Service was great, with the staff polite and attentive. The bill on the night was $3,252 and considering the quality of food, their services and overall experience, I would rate it as reasonably priced. The sommelier came to accompany us on the way out, and I promised him to return again, and enjoy a bottle of nice wine he picked next time."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,40,Great food with not as good service,"We celebrated my husband’s birthday at Lai Ching Heen and we went for the Chef Lau’s Prestigious Menu. We were very impressed at all the dishes, especially the Buddha jumping over the wall soup and the lobster trio! It was hard to pick a dish that’s not our favourite😛! However, having that said, the service was not as impressive as the food. Understood that the restaurant maybe full of guests that night, but the service felt a bit rush and not so noticeable (we had to pour our own wine 🫣 and the introduction of the dishes weren’t very clear). Hope the next experience would be better!"

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Perfect as usual,"Have had a dinner with friend at Lai Ching Heen.  As a frequent dining guest at Lao Ching Heen, we tried nearly all dishes here.  Special thanks to Chef Sang who prepared some new dishes to me.  Gratitude also to Restaurant Manager Mr. Wong who lead the team, although there are some staff left and some new staff join the team, the service standard still here. Mr. Wong can help the whole team to provide dining guests excellent dining experience.  I highly recommend dining guests who aim at high quality Cantonese food can try Lai Ching Heen."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Buffet with great service and food,The service was great and all staff members showed their smiles to everyone.  The food was good at the buffet standard.  The atmosphere could be better to consider playing some music and the plants in the middle of the restaurant might need to be replaced.

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Exquisite Dim Sum Experience,"The decoration and view are very nice, and the staff there are very caring and warmhearted, the captain introduced us their menu patiently. All the dim sum and food are super delicious and they have upgraded all the dim sum with details. I particularly love the cold crew tea developed by the restaurant, which is a mix of oolong tea and LiChee Honey, Must Try, better than Champagne."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Impeccable service!,"From the moment we reached the hotel to the restaurant to being seated, the staff handled all these very well. We pre-ordered the peking duck and it was one of our best experience ever. The peking duck was served in 3 different styles and good for 4 of us. The skin was crispy and yet juicy. We also ordered some dim sum and they were delicious. Will try again when we visit HK!"

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Enjoyable dinner with my family at LCH.,"A delightful dinner with my family at Lai Ching Heen! Beautiful restaurant with sumptuous foods and great service. I really liked the abalone in Oyster jus and my mother loved her fish. Hopefully, we will get a chance to enjoy the view next time when we visit again."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,40,Dine Like Emperor,"Purpose come to have a celebration dinner, window seating has assigned as per requested. 5 stars experience start from once we step into the reception. Hostess guide us go to the waiting area for our server ""Rain""bring us to the table. We ordered a la carte dishes from her professional recommendation. Overall, everything is good except the dessert rack. Love the tablewares, full of Chinese culture. Like the environment and the service delivery especially from Ms Rain."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Awesome Michelin Restaurant,"I was able to test the star restaurant Lai Ching Heen. I visited the restaurant during lunch.    The service is outstanding. Very courteous and is always available for advice and explanations. Also, each course is well explained.    The food was outstanding. You can expect a very high and extremely good quality of the dishes. Each course in itself was very tasty and had a good charisma. The different flavors went very well together.    For a lunch it was perfect. I am curious what there is in the evening. If you are around here, like good food, I definitely recommend a visit to the restaurant.    The interior design is also very nicely coordinated. You immediately feel at home."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Excellent Cantonese Cuisine,"Have had a solo lunch at Lai Ching Heen.l this week.  As a regular guest of previously named Yan Toh Heen and now named Lai Ching Heen, their food and service never dissatisfy me.    The dishes provided by chef are excellent and with stable quality. Their service are even perfect as usual. Thanks to Manager Henry Wong leading his team, including Assistant Manger Stephen and Andrew, as well as Max, Otto, Alex, John, Henry, Ivan, Joe, Sasa, Annika, always strive for excellence.    Special thanks to the new Tea Sommelier Kelvin who brings some new teas and updated the team menu. I tried a new Pu Er tea introduced by Kelvin and found it is very special. Definitely will try other new teas newly introduced by Kelvin in coming visits.    I highly recommend Lai Ching Heen to those dining guests who want high quality Cantonese food, tea and services."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Exceptional service & experience,"From the moment I stepped foot into the restaurant, I can immediately feel the exceptional service. The hostess, Clara was super friendly and escorted us directly to our table.    Honorable mention to Alex who took a really great care of us from start to finish. Not to mention Henry, Andrew and Joe who paid extra attention to every single detail, that makes this an amazing dining experience!    Though I'll be having my birthday within the week, they went above and beyond, and surprised me with a cake ❤️    If you want to try an authentic, one of a kind Catonese cuisine, then this is the place.    Also, I just know that I LOVE the interior, the design and the ambiance. It proves that they really put everything into a thought.    This is definitely an unforgattable experience."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,Above and Beyond,"This was my first time going back to Hong Kong after the pandemic and was my first experience at Lai Ching Heen after the renovation. We had a fabulous time - with the amazing ambience by the beautiful scenery of the Harbour and the incredible service - the pleasant welcome by Clara at the front gate of the restaurant, the outstanding service by Alex and Joe, and of course the warm welcome of Henry & Andrew as the Managers made all of the whole experience just perfect.    Not forget to mention that I enjoyed every single bite of the food - my top 3 highlights was: the Baked Air-dried Duck & Taro Buns, the Stuffed Crab Shell with Crabmeat, and the Abalone and Seafood on a Crispy Taro Net!!    I can’t wait to be back to Hong Kong and dine at this restaurant again. I will 100% recommend this restaurant to my friends & family in my home country!"

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,40,Outstanding service and delicious food,"This was the second time I visited this dining venue within a month. Upon entry, we came across one of the staff Annika who served us last time. She was amiable, gave us a warm welcome and greeted us hospitably.    We sat by the window and enjoyed the great ambience with a spectacular harbor view.    The business luncheon menu was fabulous, the dishes were displayed in an awesome manner and the food was incredible and delicious.    Special thanks for the impeccable and quality service offered by the team of Ivan, Sasa, Stephen and Max under the leadership of the manager Henry. They were professional, knowledgeable and thoughtful, taking good care of us.    We had a wonderful lunch and an unforgettable dining experience."

Lai Ching Heen - Regent Hong Kong,50,A wonderful food experience at Yan Toh Heen,"We had a wonderful lunch of Cantonese delicacies at Yan Toh Heen yesterday. The taste, texture, and colours of food are balanced, and each dish is beautifully presented and arranged on carefully selected plates to enhance the appearance. The service of all the staff of the restaurant is of very high quality, and in particular the team of Annika, Otto, and Henry. I would like to express my thanks especially to Annika who provides outstanding and professional service, explaining to us the features of each dish. This is an exceptional food experience."

Ying Jee Club,50,Authentic Cantonese Restaurant with high quality service,"It's really been a while since I've had such well prepared, tasty, and authentic Cantonese food. No wonder this is a 2 Michelin Star restaurant"

Ying Jee Club,50,Very Nice Dinner.,Great little restaurant near the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. Easy walk. Simple. Elegant. Staff friendly. The sweet and sour pork was outstanding but every dish was enjoyable. Small portions but satisfying. Nice wine list.

Ying Jee Club,40,Good chinese food,"My first time in this restaurant and its amazing! One MICHELIN Star Restaurant and I think the chef really makes delicious food. We had the tasting menu and every dish was good. However, we drank a lot on that night so it’s a bit costly!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Superb restaurant! Fantastic food and service.,"A great experience. Celebrated 50 years of friendship with old friend, sadly one of the trio was admitted to the hospital the day before so could not join us. The service is excellent and meticulous as one might expect from a Michelin 3 starred restaurant but the personnel were warm, friendly and made for a pleasant experience. The food is absolutely amazing. Every course in the large Degustation menu was superb, visually and of course, with incredible quality. A real taste sensation with some of the combinations and sauces. The beverage and wine offering is vast and will please anyone. The pre menu welcome bites were a nice touch, the pralines at the end a great finale. The dress code is adapted to a more relaxed, no tie approach, but a suit would still be just as appropriate."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing experience at Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,"I thought I wanted to treat myself a bit on my holidays, and I couldn't be happier with my choice to do so at the Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube. Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. A treat to remember!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Traditional cuisine lacking a wow effect,"After booking a table months in advance and knowing about the reputation and accolades of this well established place - I had sky-high expectations for my meal at Schwarzwaldstube. Unfortunately, the restaurant did not live up to them. Both the interior of the newly-built place as well as the vibe of the restaurant staff were not spectacular. I got the feeling they tried to copy the ""New Nordic"" concept of reduced elegance, but instead of Scandi hipsterism added German rustiness to it, which resulted in a slightly underwhelming experience.    However, in the end, I rate a restaurant mainly on the taste of its cuisine. In this case, although most dishes were very good, none of them sparked excitement. Mostly, I was missing a bold focus on top produce: All dishes contained many different ingredients, and although they usually blended well, they lacked a clear star element on the plate that would leave a lasting memory. What's worse, some dishes clearly did not reach a 3-star level. A few examples: First, the ""two kinds of venison"" dish contained - unsurprisingly - two pieces of venison. One of them was an immaculate, tender piece that was up there with the very best venison I have ever tasted; the second one was a stringy piece that I decided not to eat after tasting the first bite. Why a 3-star chef would decide to serve both pieces instead of focusing on the better part of the meat is a mystery to me. Second, the sole was prepared in a complicated manner (using some kind of lobster sauce to stick several pieces together and then cooking it sous vide), which was explained to us in long detail. However, the only result I could taste from this process was that the sole was quite hard and less tender than how I usually know it. Finally, the ""Baba au rhum"" dessert - usually one of my absolute favorites - was a disappointment since the focus clearly did not lie on serving a perfect Baba soaked in highest-quality rum, but on all kinds of garnish around a very small piece of cake that resembled a Baba mainly in shape. It was accompanied by a bowl of inedible - as in stone-hard, deep-frozen - pieces of strawberry topped with a heavy, creamy mousse. I had to return this dish almost untouched, which got barely noticed by the staff.    I want to state again that apart from the above most dishes were indeed very good - the cheese selection and the broad range of delicious chocolates deserve an honorable mention - and we did spend a lovely night at Schwarzwaldstube. But in my view this house does clearly not play in the league of the world's best restaurants (anymore)."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Finally! We made it.,"This was our third attempt to come here, and finally we actually managed. Between the many reviews and our excitement our expectations were sky high. As you probably know the original restaurant and it’s historic building burned down and the Schwarzwaldstube reopened in the same location but in a new building just very recently. Historic coziness was replaced with a rather Scandinavian-feeling minimalism. We ordered the Grand Degustation menu. To our surprise there was a lot of dishes that mixed Asian elements with European cuisine and both of us being a couple mixed a long the same lines, think what works for us, rarely works for food. That seemed hold to hold true here too. While every dish was delicious and the quality of the ingredients were clearly very high the experience lacked wow effects for us. We still of course had a very satisfactory meal and enjoyed ourselves very much, also because of the attentive and very friendly service. We would love to come back when the menu changes and try again."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Lacking the dazzling brilliance of our previous dinner here,"The last time we dined here was in late 2019, just a couple of months before the historic bulding in which this restaurant was housed, sadly burnt down. The restaurant has only just reopened in its new permanent home, a fabulous piece of contemporary architecture that maximises the spectacular views. The interior now enjoys a double-height ceiling and has a fabulously airy and contemporary feel.    Our 2019 dinner here (see separate review) was spectacular with exceptional dish after exceptional dish; in summary our dinner here in 2022 felt far more pedestrian in comparison.    As is usually the case in 3* Michelin restaurants we took the longest tasting menu, which ones hopes, is usually the best expression of the kitchen's output and provides a journey to experience as many different dishes as possible. As my wife is pescatarian a couple of the meat dishes were thoughtfully and easily swapped for fish ones. By the end of the savoury courses, I too wished that I had gone with the pescatarian option.    The amuse bouches were pleasant enough, but there was no flash of genius that one often hopes for in a 3* Michelin restaurant. The final amuse of a salmon tartar was nice enough, but it was just a nice salmon tartar, nothing more. Then we were into the main menu, which began with a foie gras terrine which was again nice enough, and perfectly made, but there was no ""wow"" there and the fruit pairings with it were very classic. As a contrast, at L'Hotel de Ville (a 3* Michelin restaurant in Crissier) the previous weekend, they took the foie gras to a much more bitter and savoury place which was more interesting than this.    This was followed by a beautiful lobster dish which had perfectly cooked lobster with the most perfect texture and was paired with what is probably best described as the most complex and refined Thai style curry sauce. This was a lovely dish packed full of flavour and technique.    Next up was a fish dish with a perfectly cooked piece of John Dory paired with a variety of preparations of fennel and a beurre blanc sauce split with a herb oil. This was lovely cookery with the fish perfectly cooked, and the whole dish ate very well. However, this is what I'd expect in a solid 2* restaurant, there was nothing that elevated this to that 3* Michelin level.    The worst course by far was a morel and pork dish. There was a big lump of pork on the plate, which was perfectly cooked and just pink in the centre. The black truffle sauce tasted like the meat stock component was ever so slightly over reduced, and the accompanying morels didn't have much morel flavour and just tasted a bit salty. The best thing on the plate was a number of preparations of peas which had amazing flavour and brought freshness to the palate. As with the previous dish, this was 2* Michelin level cooking, but there was nothing exciting about it, in fact it was a pretty boring dish.    My wife on the other hand enjoyed some far more exciting fish dishes which were firmly in the 3* category; it is such a shame that the kitchen didn't create more interesting meat based dishes. The meat courses felt like lazy cooking; dishes which the chef had not spent much time developing. One does not expect this lack of attention to detail in a 3* Michelin restaurant.    Fortunately the dessert took a turn for the better, although for me the plating was too simple and didn't match the amazing flavours of the dishes. The most impressive dessert was a chocolate sorbet accompanied with a super light liqueur mousse and cherries such that it had the classic flavours of the black forest gateau but in a completely different format. My description does not do justice to how good this dish was. A mille-feuille of gariguette strawberries was also very impressive, but again could have been plated to better effect.    The wine list here is spectacular and full of hard to find gems so is a real treat and the wine service itself deserves a special mention as the servers were continually checking on the temperature of the white wine and putting in back on the ice as appropriate. Top marks for attention to detail here.    I would happily have shared my thoughts at the time, but no manager stopped to ask how the meal had been. Perhaps our expectations were set too high given how wonderful our last meal here was. This one just doesn't compare at any level and felt dull by comparison. Maybe we caught the kitchen on an off day, but it was incredibly disappointing to experience this dinner, albeit my wife's food was more 3* Michelin than mine. We will nevertheless try it again and hopefully the kitchen will be on better form."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Iconic - no other word,"The Schwarzwaldstube is among the iconic restaurants of Germany and indeed Europe - no other place in D has held 3 stars for as long. The current temporary venue is pretty comfortable but we await the completion of the rebuilt restaurant (the old one burned down in Jan. 2020). The meal we had there was outstanding from the amuse bouches to the mignardises - the langoustine and lobster as starters were truly world class. My main of sea bass was very good but not at the same level as the langoustine or the lobster. We chose a la carte, and the courses/portions were surprisingly generous. We thus only ordered only 2 portions of the soufflé (for 3 persons) - that was excellent as well and at the same level as a soufflé at the Hotel de Ville as few years ago.. Service was most pleasant and unrushed, the waitress even asking for the score of the Euro 2020 which was played that evening. Stéphane Gass is a world class sommelier, and we enjoyed the 2008 Josmeyer Riesling he recommended over another Riesling from F.P. Keller....... we will mot certainly return, and sooner rather than later"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the Five Best Restaurants in Europe,"We took two trains and a bus from Stuttgart and spent a night at Traube Tonbach in October 2018 just to eat at Schwarzwaldstube. It was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made.    Chef Michel is a genius and deserves high praise. While no single dish sticks out like the Lasagana at Osteria Francescana or the Caviar Eggs Benedict at Eleven Madison Park, every detail of every preparation was perfect. No needless attempts at being overly inventive - just supreme quality ingredients prepared in perfect combinations in accordance with the same local tradition that was respected by Chef Wohlfarht.    The location in the Black Forest is magical. The cheese cart is awesome. Service is extremely honest and professional. Chef walked around to greet each table towards the end of the evening - as many high-profile chefs do - but he did so in a very genuine, attentive way. Difficult to describe, but the humility of the restaurant despite its legendary status is striking.    We were fortunate to make the pilgrimage here before the fire. What a special place. We will never forget that meal."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Perfect wine pairing,The food was expectedly superb but it was the wine pairing that I loved. It was absolutely divine. It was the best in any Michelin-starred restaurants I’ve been to. I greatly appreciated the friendly service as well. It wasn’t stuffy at all. Hope to be back when the new place is up.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolutely top notch cuisine,"As a fan of more classical than ultra modern Nordic style food I had high expectations for Schwarzwaldstube. The room itself manages to mix classic Black Forest style carved wood with a contemporary neutral palette to great effect. The same traditional foundations paired with modern touches extends into the cuisine.    The wine list is extensive and offers a wonderful selection of varietals and vintages from some of the world's best producers and the markups are very modest so it is a real treat for the wine enthusiast. The service throughout the evening was extremely attentive and slick whilst remaining friendly too.    As expected the food was the perfect combination of top notch technique and the best produce. Sauces had a wonderful depth of flavour and an extra serving of each of the sauces halfway through one's dish is a really generous and most welcome touch. We had their longest tasting menu and every single dish was a joy to eat which is not always the case with these types of menu. The quality and attention to detail was absolutely consistent and the seasoning was very delicate and perfectly judged.    Compared to other restaurants operating at a similar level, Schwarzwaldstube is right at the top of the pack, and offers the perfect blend of the old and the new. We've already planned a return visit!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,An amazing experience!,"We managed to make a reservation for lunch. The dinner service was already booked when we were making our hotel reservations. The restaurant is very intimate, just a few tables, with big windows opening to the valley around us.    We decided to have the large degustation menu as we wanted to have the full experience. And what a treat it was! Everything was simply delicious. We asked for a wine pairing and the sommelier did a fantastic job too. The waiters worked very well together and the service was excellent. My husband who never eats liver was raving about the duck liver! If there is something you don’t care for, they can do swaps. But honestly, everything they serve is amazing!    The only critique I have is that they do not bring you a wine menu. We did not ask for it but still, it would be nice to know in advance what the damage would be...    We loved the restaurant and we are already making plans for returning!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Simply the best,"First and foremost is the feeling on entering this restaurant. As if your floating within the forest, peace and tranquility . All you can see from windows is natural beauty.  The waiting staff are as you would expect , with an added bonus of being personable, easy and perfectionists.  They move between each other like a fine ballet. Smooth, efficient and so very pleasant. All speaking perfect English.  The food is the best, from start to finish mind blowing . We went for the seven courses . They will happily accommodate six or mixing for personal taste. The wines are paired perfectly , outstanding in fact.  The chef made a point of going around each table at the end of the evening.  What an incredible talent.  An evening I will not forget."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Definitely worth the visit - absolutely exceptional,"My partner and i travel to Baiersbronn once a year to celebrate his birthday at our favorite restaurant in the world, Schwarzwaldstube    Truly worthy of its 3 Stars in every respect - from the beautiful and elegant decor, to the magnificent view of the forest and villages in the distance, the highly experienced and friendly team, to most importantly the exceptional food. We normally dine twice during each visit, and every single course is a treat. Congratulations to Torsten and his team for a perfect job in every respect in creating this wonderful oasis    Can not recommend highly enough - if you are a real foodie, you really need to visit this incredible restaurant soon ."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A remarkable Restaurant in every way,"Nestled in The Black Forest since 1789, Traube Tonbach is considered one of Germany's most luxurious destinations, and at Michelin 3* Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube Chef Torsten Michel continues a tradition of greatness that has yielded over 50 Michelin starred Chefs over the years.    Historically Germany’s most important Restaurant, three Michelin Stars awarded under the toque of Harald Wohlfhart whose tenure stretched from 1990 until 2017, guests visiting Baiersbronn are now treated to the talents of a man who served as Wohlfhart’s sous for over a decade, and from the moment one steps through the dining room doors it is hard to believe any aspect of the experience has ever been better.    Well appointed with an elevated view of the Black Forest, “Schwarzwald” in German, Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube resides in the heavily wooded main building but creates a light space thanks to bright whites and big windows, the show quick to begin before menus even arrive as guests are treated to bites including Beef Tartare, a refined Shrimp Chip and Mackerel brightened by Curry and Coriander.    Given the choice to order a la carte or via tasting, the latter ranging 165€ to 245€ depending on length and ingredients, it was with one Large Degustation plus a Vegetarian Menu and a glass of Wine each that dinner continued at a comfortable pace, Salmon Tartare and Red Pepper Mousse built on Couscous offered as Amuses to their respective menus with each just a hint of the artistry soon to come.    Taking no shortcuts, Bread repeatedly arriving warm and highlighted by Olive Focaccia as well as seeded Cereal Bread ready to be slathered in local Butter, course one offered tender Lobster medallions amidst saline Custard and Oysters perfumed by Lemon Grass, the harmony achieved undeniably impressive just as it was for wood-fired Artichokes that offered noteworthy variance from bite to bite depending on ratio of Black Truffle or Mustard involved.    Open to swapping items between tastings or even a la carte, it was trusting Chef Torsten that dinner continued henceforth, any preconceived notions about Beef Liver erased by a tender cut softened by Barolo and brightened by Peas while Morels offered their earthy aromatics to both this composition and the Vegetarian alternative featuring Egg Yolk cooked inside Mushroom Jelly that acted like the skin of a Ravioli.    Lightening up course three, a Filet of Red Mullet reminiscent of Guy Savoy in its use of crispy “scales” served amidst vibrant Red Pepper Coulis, it was with impressive artistry that the Vegetarian Menu one-upped its counterpart by way of tiny Tomatoes and Onions hollowed and refilled with fortified Cream atop a fresh Tomato Tart resting in Pine Nut Marinade.    Not an overly-long menu, though portions will assuredly challenge those of smaller appetites, savories concluded by way of Duck Margret and Confit alongside stacked Turnips and thin, yet intense, Sauce plus “Chef’s vision of Spring” as Green Asparagus and Young Peas forming the base to laminated Pastry ready to sop up what was described as “Beef-free Bordelaise,” though if served alongside the real deal only the most discerning might be able to detect a difference.    Proudly wheeling out a Cheese Cart, many local plus several from France offered with Bread, it was after taste buds were sent reeling by Cabri Ariégeois that the rest proved well-aged and pleasant, though the composed course of melted Chabichou and Potato Mousseline with Garlic Pistou was an enviable alternative and fantastic transitional dish to the Vegetarian Dessert offering Gariguette Strawberries in several textures atop a boozy Baba anchored by Chantilly Crème.    Equally elegant in the presentation of a Yuzu Croustillant in sour surroundings, this dish essentially a palate cleanser in preparation for Schwarzwaldstube’s reinterpreted Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, both this Dessert and its counterpart featuring Chocolate, Bananas and Lime were amongst the most complex sweets seen in Germany, each bite a little different from the last but all of them memorable and just as relevant to the whole.    Undeniably deserving of its accolades, not even one item from the collection of Mignardises lacking in terms of artistry or flavor, it was after settling the bill that guests were bid auf Wiedersehen with the lone regret being opting not to spend a night at Traube Tonbach in order to enjoy Breakfast the next morning."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A Little Bit too much SALT,"I had the Small tasting Menu with 5 courses ,  Very Imaginative courses with some Asia Twist,  such as the Raw Tuna with Soy sauce.    The dishes Beautiful but they have a little too much salt in ALL of them.    After the Told them I am on a low Salt diet, the taste turned a little milder.    Service was excellent......"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing restaurant,"Went there as a present for my Mum's 70th birthday and weren't disappointed. The service team was extremely friendly, attentive and easygoing. They even prepared the table nicely for the ""birthday girl"" although i only mentioned it once a couple of weeks ago when I made the reservation. The place is cosy and nicely decorated with a stunning view of thw black forest. The food is simply perfect, regardless of what you're eating. The pigeon was great, the cheese soft and tasty and the dessert beyond any standard. I've been to the Schwarzwaldstube before (Mr. Wolfarth's time) and I habe to say that it didn't get worse. We'll be back (after we have trained the menu away...)."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Excellent restaurant!,"We visited for lunch, and had a la carte. Perfect cooking and amazing skills shown both tehnically and flavourwise. Service was flawless, warm, welcoming. They hd great knowledge of the food and wine. Next time we come for dinner! Thanks for an amazing culinary treat."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Amazing restaurant,Beyond my expectations my first 3 star dining experience. I can’t wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food staff and location.    The staff obviously love working where they work.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Incredible experience,"My husband and I had the pleasure of eating here during our trip to the Black Forest this year. We had the 7 course dinner with wine pairings. We can’t say enough wonderful things about the beautiful, delicious food, and the fantastic, friendly service. The wine pairings were absolutely perfect, and included a good balance of German and other European wines. We had an incredible experience overall, and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area who is looking for a fine dining experience. We would love the opportunity to visit again in the future."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A truly magical evening!,"A German friend of ours recommended this restaurant when they learned we were staying in nearby Baden-Baden for our honeymoon. We were still several weeks out and were able to get reservations for one of the nights we'd be nearby.    The restaurant did request that we re-confirm our reservations one week in advance of our visit.    Our reservations were for 7:00 PM. We were unfamiliar with the area and had a long drive (1 hour or more) so we gave ourselves plenty of time. We arrived about 30 minutes early and the dining room was not yet open.    They made us feel welcome, inviting us to sit in a comfortable and beautiful waiting area. They provided us with a choice of aperitifs and we selected two different types so we could compare. Both were delicious.    Once the restaurant was opened (a little earlier than 7:00) they invited us to our table - we were right against the window, with a beautiful view. We found they had a name card on the table. My wife had made the reservations and used her maiden name. When we told them we'd just been married as we were enjoying our aperitif, they were attentive to the name difference and made up a new name card for us, showing our new married status. That was a very nice touch!    The rest of the experience just got better with every interaction. The 3 small bites of the amuse-bouche was delightful and gave a hint of the incredible experience ahead of us.    I selected the small digestive menu and my wife the vegetarian. There were phenomenal moments in both, but I would have to say the vegetarian menu was my favorite. One plate in particular was so incredible, I jumped at the chance when they asked if I'd like one of my very own. All I can say is WOW!    To limit what could easily be a novel-length review, I will share some additional highlights that stood out.    1) The friendliness of the staff truly made you feel like you were an honored guest or some long lost family member. Rather than making you feel like they were doing you a favor by allowing you to dine with them, they made us feel special and welcome and that they truly appreciated our custom.    2) The visit by the owner stood out. He warmly welcomed us and shared some brief history of the hotel. I am always more loyal to restaurants where the owner, chef or management take the time to greet you, inquire about your experience and say thank you.    3) The staff. Each person was a true delight. I wish I knew their names so I could call them out, because they deserve the recognition. Each played their role impeccably well, with just the right amount of professionalism and personality to make the experience as wonderful as the food.    4) Lastly and most significantly was the food. WOW! I am not sure how it is possible to create such an experience in a single bite. Visual presentation, aromas, flavors, temperatures and textures combined into what I can only describe as an emotional response. I'm not sure how the chef was able to tap directly into my emotion centers but some of these flavor combinations were so incredible, I remember them not as ""taste"" but instead ""experience"" - a truly wonderful experience at that. .... I had to laugh at one point. The reaction was so strong that I closed my eyes and covered my mouth and just reveled in the great flavor. One of the gals came up to me to ask if everything was alright! :) ""Oh yes! Very right!"" was what I thought, and probably what I said. That was the single best bite of food of my life so far."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,"One of the finest restaurants in Europe, if not the world.","We are from the USA and liked this restaurant so much when we visited last May that we just returned for a second visit. Much to our surprise the Maitre’D recognized us and gave us a table on the opposite side of the room from where we sat the last time so that we could enjoy a different view. We had the vegetarian tasting menu and it was the finest we have ever had, by far. Everything was perfect. Service was knowledgeable and efficient. We are already planning our return. The Maitre’D is a good source of recommendation for other fine restaurants."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolutely fantastic!!!,"I can't say enough about the quality of food and service we received at this Michelin 3 star restaurant. The waitstaff was so thorough yet incredibly friendly - not stuffy at all.    The restaurant has 12 tables and the setting and views are lovely. We were there with our 2 teenage sons and had a lovely circular table next to the window.    And the food...what can I say - it was outstanding. We purchased a la carte, an appetizer, main and dessert and of course they bring 2 amuse bouche before the appetizer and selections from the dessert carte after your dessert. Every bite we took was phenomenal. This was the culinary highlight of our German vacation!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Excellent - worth its 3 stars,"There isn't much to add to the rest of the reviews here: it's simply excellent from start to end. The food is absolutely incredible. We had the vegetarian and regular tasting menu with wine pairing. Most of the courses were not only something we never had before, which is not an easy feat, but a perfect combination of several smaller dishes, perfectly in sync with each other. It's hard to explain: you simply have to experience it.    A special mention should go to the young sommelier that took care of us that evening. She was incredibly nice and also highly competent. We really appreciated the broad knowledge that accompanied each wine and the passion that she displayed each time.    All in all it was simply a perfect experience, there is literally nothing we would change and we look very much forward to our next visit!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,"Food, wine, service, location - perfect!","One of my best restaurant experiences ever.  The food was excellent - innovative as well as perfectly executed.  The wines were perfectly matched with the menu - and the sommelier and his staff were very knowledgeable.  Excellent service - good at adapting to the diners.  Perfect location in Schwarzwald, good view from the restaurant.  By far better than the nearby Bareiss Restaurant (also ***). We chose to stay at the Bareiss Hotel (recommended!) because they had a more appealing website - next time we'll stay at Hotel Traube Tonbach. There is a complimentary limousine service between the two hotels and their ***-restaurants."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best fine dining restaurants in the world,From the moment you walk in the food is magical from the amuse bouche to the main courses to the incredible desserts.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Very nice experience,"The setting is very nice with large windows overlooking the Black Forrest.  Ambiance inside the restaurant could be better, its a little too sterile for my taste.  The food was excellent and so was the service. We had a very enjoyable evening."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Finally the real deal!,Basic food taken to the next level! From Maultaschen über grüne Sosse to Kalbsrahmgulasch. Absolutely to die for

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Black Forest romance Dinner!,"With my wife we were lucky to dine at some of the most distinctive and finest Michelin star rated restaurants in Europe. Needless to say that we were anxious to visit this place as well. After all Harald Wohlfahrt is the most often Michelin 3 star decorated chef in Germany even though his second Torsten Michel succeeded him by now.    The result is simply “delicious” in every sense of the word. This restaurant greets you warmly with a cozy atmosphere. Nicely fitted in a Black Forest decoration the restaurant is small and very charming.    From a service level perspective, being in Germany you would normally expect a heavily disciplined army of waiters and sommelier where everything looks orchestrated almost artificially to a level of perfection and where you would still feel some cold distance. Well the result is completely different : still a superb perfection is being achieved but thanks to a young team of waiters, sommelier and maître d’hôtel that make you feel very welcome but all of this still with a level of great discipline and warmth in the service.    It is almost as if you would be invited to a select dinner event by a family member who has not seen you in years and who is willing to go out its way to make you feel comfortable and to impress you in every single aspect of being a host. Around 10pm the kids club closed and we were even invited to take the boys to our table without any kind of disturbing look or impression. It is worth noting this that families are simply welcome here as well.    From a food perspective, I am still looking for the mistake or hiccup but simply cannot find it. All scents and flavors are nicely combined to strike a delicate balance that eventually triggers a fabulous explosion in your mouth.    It is certainly not the most innovative cuisine we have tasted yet (but we did not come to this place for that!) but it is as far as I can recollect the best dishes we ever tried!!!    I will intentionally not comment on any particular dish but will simply say that if you go for the langoustine, the lotte or the lobster, you will seal your own doom of having to go back there time and time again as your palette will firmly remind you on a regular basis of what a fantastic experience this has been.    Prices are very high, but this comes to no surprise in such a fine restaurant. The wine list is superb and prices slightly below my expectations for such a fine dining place.    Call us old school, but what we also like is that you are also greeted by the owner or the chef himself and in this place the owner Heinrich Finkbeiner himself comes to your table, presents himself and engages in a short but very honest discussion with you simply aiming at making you feel almost home!!!    We will certainly come back to this place, very hungry for more..."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,A dream come true,"Pure bliss and delight! We celebrated a very special moment there and couldn’t have chosen a better place. The team around the new chef Michel is excellent, their delivery outstanding - from the first moment you enter to the moment you leave. Paradise on earth.    We had the ‘small’ degustations menu. Absolutely recommend. On top we chose the accompanying wines and had the pleasure of the sommelier explaining every new glass he served. The service is highly competent and friendly. You feel welcome and not stiff at all.    This is a place for your bucket list."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Wow!,"If you are fortunate to get a reservation at this fantastic restaurant you will be in for a real experience.Like the hotel,this restaurant could not be better.The staff works very hard to make the evening perfect.Amazing food & wonderful wine selection at varying price points.The ""Christmas Ornament"" desert made me wish I brought my camera.The chef & owner visit every table.What a treat!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Spectacular!,"Our evening was perfect, start to finish. The dining room is stunning. The staff are welcoming and pleasant. The food was absolutely delicious. The wine and wine service was lovely. We had a wonderful, fun time and enjoyed every bite."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,The absolute pinnacle of fine dining,"The Black Forest has always been known for scenic beauty and heartfelt hospitality. You're not greeted with hello, but rather with: Gruess Gott. That already gives you a warm feeling. The restaurant exudes an air of elegance and yet sturdiness in keeping with the surroundings. The service is professional, knowledgeable and unhurried, that includes the sommelier service, the wines were wonderful parings. The stand-out course for me was the seared foie gras, but I hasten to add that the entire meal was a highly sensual experience. Mr. Wohlfahrt certainly deserves the three stars as well as 18th place on La Liste. I am attaching a copy of the menu as well as the maximum allowable pictures."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Perfect in all respects,We had an exceptional meal and visit at this wonderful restaurant. The tasting menu was exceptional and the maitre d' let us choose and replace absolutely everything we wanted. The turbot in seaweed salt is a must. Every dish was outstanding. Service was consistently pleasant and helpful and the owner came very graciously to greet us at the beginning of our meal. The design of the room is traditional with a beautiful view of the forest. Overall a very memorable and wonderful experience.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Good food...nice setting,Good food...nice setting...not far from the Bareiss...give it a try while in the area...nice environment.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Uskomaton,"**** Stars one of the best meals and menu i have ever taste,desserts were unbelievebull ,wines selection and very nice and smooth service  i recommed ,from my full heart ,the atmosphere is so nice and how they put all portions outlook,taste and local dishes are very good on the menu"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,3 star food without the breathless fussiness,"My title says it all. Excellent, thoughtful, good advice for meal and wine pairing, but ultimately the choices are left to the customer, completely without stuffy judgment."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,traditional and comfortable,"if you like your 3 star Michelin restaurants to provide traditional style food , this restaurant works well. It doesn't have the excitement in the food that others provide, but everything is prepared and presented at the highest quality. Its much more casual and relaxed than many places and perhaps risks not feeling extra special."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best anywhere,"We came to Baiersbronn especially for this restaurant and we were not disappointed. They have a large and small price fixe option as well as a la carte. We opted for the large which was 7 course with wine pairing. Spectacular! Each course was a show stopper and the service was first class. The wait staff were very friendly and both the owner and the chef came out to greet the guests. There were several additional courses that they added along the way, making this an event meal. Highly recommend coming here while you are here in the Black Forest."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Simply the best! Unforgettable!,"we had a stay at the Bareiss and tried the ""Schwarzwaldstube"". A true Michlin-3-star restaurant.  We tried the large and short menu, added / changed some of the meals and were highly impressed. The taste of the food, the optical presentation and the professionality of the entire staff were unmatched. A some sort of slim, but very clever assorted wine list fitted perfectly to the menu offerings.  We never dined that good in ""ole Germany"". Our finish was rounded up by a personal visit at our table of ""chef"" Harald.  Simply unforgettable!"

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,40,Classic gourmet dinner,"We stayed two nights at the Traube Tonbach hotel and on the second night we had dinner at their three star Schwarzwaldstube in the building opposite. We had a five course dinner which was very good, but very traditional. We were not over-impressed by the staff. We entered the restaurant at 20h00 na d had a prédinner drink. One waitress approached our tabel with assorted breads but noticed there were no side plates on the table. She walked away and did not come back to put side plates on the table. After half an hour, at 21h00, I asked her if we could get any bread and all she asked me was: Oh, are you hungry? I found this a bit odd in a restaurant with three Michelin stars. We noticed that the maitre was paying attention to all regular guests during the whole evening whilst we only granted a nodd. We found the ambiance typical Schwarzwald. It is also a pity that there is no toilet on the same floor as the restaurant. Disabled people have to go to the toilet in the hotel opposite the street."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,wonderful,"We have been to the 3 star Michelin restaurant here twice before and know it to be fantastic. This time we wanted to go to the Stube as we were just passing through to Metzingen. The setting, atmosphere, service, attention to detail was perfection - like a Michelin starred restaurant. The food was delicious and high end. We had the four course taster menu and then had coffee and an extremely large slice of the black forest gateau from the coffee shop.....mmmmm (we shared one piece).  Loved it so much we have booked to take the parents back in July this year. We just want to share the experience at an affordable price. We only do the 3 star Michelin meals for our wedding anniversary once per year. Enjoy this place - a hidden gem in paradise."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Truly one of the best,"Let me just say, whether you believe in the quality of Guide Michelin or Gault Millaut, there is a reason why Chef Wohlfahrt is the longest standing chef with a continuous 3 star rating.  I won't go into the details of the menu, as it changes quite frequently, but from what we experienced I can say that I am convinced that whatever will be on the menu will be perfect. The service was impeccable and absolutely friendly. The choices made by the sommelier for each course of the dinner have been perfect. Pricey, yes it is, but worth every penny."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,The best of the best,"(The wife and) I have been to a number of great restaurants with all possible numbers of coques, stars and points. But this one is the best of them all, by a mile. The level of delightful perfection achieved by Harald Wohlfahrt and his team is literally incredible. Every time we come here we are blown away by the atmosphere, the wonderful service team and, most of all, the sensational food. Craftsmanship, creativity, imagination served with a nice touch of Southern German understatement make for an unbeatable combination."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,excellent allways .we at,we liked everything.we were there 4 times and every time it is an amazing experience.The food quality presentation and the outstanding service.

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,Absolute highlight in my culinary life,"Today was the absolute highlight in my culinary life. I had lunch at the fabulous restaurant “Schwarzwald Stube”, headed by Harald Wohlfahrt, one of Germany’s 3-Michelin-Star chefs. We went for the great 7 course meal which kept us entertained for about 4.5 hours. Following an amuse bouche, we started with tartar and mousse of mildly smoked sturgeon with imperial caviar and oyster vinaigrette. A glass of a white burgundy accompanying it was surprising in that it had the honey bouquet of a sweet desert sautern but was ultra-dry on the tongue with fruity, mineral notes.    A fried goose liver with artichokes and a caper pesto on balsamico glace formed the second course. I’m not commenting on quality – everything with no exception at all was just fabulous – fantastic material, creatively combined, cooked to the point. The service was also flawless, with a special price to be awarded to the sommelier whose recommendations where always right. The goose liver was accompanied by another white burgundy, this time with pronounced notes of oak.    The third course – scallops with a truffles from the Perigord – was especially nice because it was combined with a local speciality, Topinambur roots, their earthy, moldy :-) taste perfectly complementing the truffle. The main course, a potpourri of lamb with fennel compote and a mild garlic jus underpinned again Wohlfahrt’s dedication to flawless ingredients combined with uncompromising craftsmanship.    Although already slightly overwhelmed by what we had so far and time approaching 3 o’clock (we had started at noon), the cheese cart selection easily managed to revive our excitement. My memory being as bad as it is, I can only recall an ash-covered creamy goat cheese and a perfectly semi-liquid brie, but all six specimens on my cheese table where equally sensational. For both the lamb as well as the cheese we went for a Rioja, which was smooth with a well-balanced rich full body.    The first of the two concluding deserts consisted of a warm lemon biscuit on rhubarb compote, with a ginger lime sorbet served in a separate glass. The latter combination of tastes is one of my eternal favorites which I try to get where ever I can. The sommelier recommended a 1992 Riesling Beerenauslese for desert, which have lost a lot of its initial intense sweetness over the years and was now just incredible, with a wonderful acidity over fruit and honey notes.    The last course served its purpose of completely equilibrating our taste buds. A simply surprising apple-cilantro sorbet was set on a bed of mango and hibiscus juice, with a crunchy eucalyptus oblate on top.    So, it was simply astounding. We would have preferred to go there for dinner, but you need to book a dinner table up to a year in advance, depending on when you want to go (I guess, Saturday evening is the hardest). However, if you consider visiting Harald Wohlfahrt’s Schwarzwald Stube, just book a table – it will be an unforgettable event, no matter how long you wait for the evening to arrive.    Since this first experience in 2008 I had the please to dine on three other evenings in the Schwarzwaldstube, the last time in 2014. All evenings where superb."

Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube,50,One of the best meals I've ever had ...,"We were very fortunate to be staying at Traube Tronbach when another guest cancelled & we were given the table. The waiters were charming & amusing. They explained each dish for each course (averaging 3 dishes per course). The wine pairings were excellent. I had never before had a menu in which I enjoyed every course. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish everything; there was just to much food. Arguably (and my family did discuss this at length), this was one of the finest meals we're ever had."

Restaurant Flore,10,Great Service with very strong vinaigrette taste on main course,"The service is great. The food starts great until the beginning of the main course which become very strong acidity, balsamic vinaigrette taste. Can’t barely taste anything else except the vinegar. Awful meal, don’t deserve Michelin stars with current menu."

Restaurant Flore,50,Fantastic,This is creative cuisine at its best. Vegetarian menu with fantastic products. Very friendly service and excellent wine advices.

Restaurant Flore,50,Wonderful,"Wonderful experience, innovative, charmfull. Perfect savoir- faire, beautiful atmosphere, excellent wines. Nice philosophy, highly professional entourage."

Restaurant Flore,50,Superb cuisine.,"A very high quality dining experience. Unexpected flavours and textures, all crafted exclusively from ingredients from the Netherlands, without use of dairy. I don't take pictures of food in restaurants and think it's inappropriate to do do."

Restaurant Flore,50,Always a pleasure to come back here,"There is a perfect harmony between atmosphere, services, food, pairing wines.  The food is delicious, creative, inspiring, excellent quality.  The stuff is very friendly and they do their best. They look enthusiastic and motivated .  Cozy atmosphere in a great location with the view to Amstel river.  Try a stop at Freddy’s bar before the dinner, - the same location- it adds an extra smile to the whole experience."

Restaurant Flore,20,Disappointing and overpriced New Year’s Eve meal,"We had booked through TA reviews and the 2 stars Michelin, hoping to taste an exceptional meal.  For a price of 225€ the surprise menu without beverage, we expected a lot better.  Obviously the chef’s preference is to use local products, which is nice, but also serve some game (deer, wild hare) with a particularly strong taste. Overall a mix of old French « cuisine bourgeoise » with fake modernity. Confusing and not adapted to current tastes. Moreover, people at the other tables around us were lip-service eating, if at all, the meat coming from local hunting. When the waiter asked us how we had found the meal, we told that it was a risky choice from the chef, even for a festive surprise menu. The tasteless dairy-less dessert was disappointing as well.    In short, despite a perfectly mastered technique (cooking, preparations) and the vegetables that were indeed tasty, the pleasure was missing.    Professional service that does not make up for this pompous cooking."

Restaurant Flore,50,My best experience in Amsterdam,"located inside the Hotel De L'Europe, the Flora restaurant is one of the most interesting places to have a wonderful culinary experience.  It has two Michelin stars and that in itself is already a guarantee of high quality of both food and service, but personally my experience was beyond my expectations.  First of all I have to thank you, because it was a beautiful dinner but also because you made a special day for me (my wedding) an unforgettable experience, and then because you took great care of all the details.  The chef has shown his great talent for this I also thank him, thank you Bas .... you are very good.  Every single course was special, the flavors and combinations are certainly the result of a lot of work and a lot of study, the same goes for the service and for the dining room staff ... everyone, absolutely everyone was kind and polite, really good. With their expertise they involved us throughout the tasting process. The restaurant is beautiful, elegant and well furnished, simple and refined taste .... a beauty of the past but at the same time modern. I have nothing else to add except a heartfelt thank you for everything you have done, I hope you get the third star too....you deserve it all. Best regards Pierangelo"

Restaurant Flore,50,Amsterdam at its finest,"Last meal in Amsterdam was a total blast. Utterly blown away by the level of attention to details & sustainability code of conduct at @restaurant.flore.    2 Michelin ⭐️⭐️ as well as 1 Michelin🍀 showcase nothing but pure magic inside the walls of the new reopened Dutch extravaganza.    Sea snails, cuttlefish, escargots, the most beautiful indulging cooked veggies and one of the best sourdough I ever tried, topped off with silky homemade oregano oil.    The front of house service was on point throughout the night and very helpful with tons of information about the concept, the project and the questions that had arise during dinner. Very well trained and top notch in terms of professionalism.

Nothing but pure appreciation towards you all."

Restaurant Flore,50,Superb,"Absolutely outstanding. Food quality, creativity, presentation, superb wine pairing, excellent staff. Do not miss Flore! We enjoyed a 5-hour dinner; highlight of our trip. Experience matched a 2-star Michelin."

Restaurant Flore,50,Great evening,"We had an absolutely amazing experience here. The food was so good and the service was spectacular. The service here was unreal too, I can't recommend this restaurant enough. It is a must try spot!"

Restaurant Flore,20,Food is not tasty. Very slow,Food is not tasty. Very slow service. High price. I cannot recommend this place for a good time with your friends or family.

Restaurant Flore,10,Extremely ridiculous!,So you want to plan a special evening for a special person…. Booked a table and was notified that I had to pay €200 per person in order to finalize the booking! You have got to be kidding! This is so utterly outrageous I will refuse to eat there!

Restaurant Flore,50,More than what we expected (from reviews),"Professional, diligent service. Surprising, excellent amuses before the diner had begun and even after!  Definitely returning with good friends or family.  Thank you so much for an unforgettable, mouth-watering evening :-)"

Restaurant Flore,50,Loved every little bit!!!,"Came here while visiting our friends in town. Impeccable white glove service but without the stuffiness. In fact the staff were so friendly and hilarious we’d come back just for the service! Dinner was also an amazing adventure of flavors and textures, and we’d highly recommend the wine pairing. The view at night was also superb. Very thoughtfully curated restaurant experience. Would visit again!"

Restaurant Flore,50,Delicate & modern Dutch fine dinning,"We enjoyed Bor’deaux On the last night of our stay at hotel de L’Europe, and one might say best for last. I don’t know if the dining room was so intimate and spacious because there weren’t a lot of reservations that evening, but there was a lot of space in between tables giving a nice feel of privacy. This is much more of a low-key and quiet restaurant than a glitzy restaurant. The quality of the food and the quality of the service makes up for the quiet atmosphere. Play full dishes and presentations, inspired cocktail selection which I enjoyed two of. I would definitely recommend this one Michelin star restaurant if you’re looking for some of the best local cuisine in Amsterdam in a quiet environment."

Restaurant Flore,50,Above and beyond,"Dined at Bord’eau with my boyfriend and another couple. We each had the six-course menu with wine pairings. The food was simply sublime. Particular favorites at our table were a lamb heart amuse bouche, oyster and sea vegetables, partridge, langostino, venison, and hare. The night was made all the more magical thanks to our server, Mai, and the sommelier, Thijs. Thanks for an unforgettable evening — and for putting up with us after the wine hit us all a couple courses in."
