14 Wall Street,50,A favorite for many decades,"I've been coming to this place with my parents since I was a little child, and I'm now in my 30s. It's our family tradition. We love this place, and it's been written about in the NYT    It's a very old house (typical for the Old Quarter), but the dining room is air conditioned. The stairs are tiny because Vietnamese people are small, but just go slowly!    There is only one dish. You eat by mixing the herbs in with the fish, and then in a small bowl you gather vermicelli, a few peanuts, a dollop of shrimp paste, a few pieces of fish and maybe one teaspoon of oil from the pan. Mix them all up, and you have yourself a delicious dish! The quality has stayed consistent for the last ~20+ years.    Yes, it is 'more expensive' than the other street food in Hanoi, but still it's maybe $8/serving, and you'd probably need 2. Seems cheap to me!"

14 Wall Street,10,Disappointed at all! Services,"Disappointed at all!  Services are bad, prices are terrible.  Special are Owner and Staff. They are so impolite.  Maybe they think they famous and good business and they don care services.  Hope they can keep their business on the future.  First time and last time. Too scary and disappointed.  Not recommend."

14 Wall Street,10,This is first time and last time,"This is first time and last i come here.  They are so impolite and rude.  Owner and staff like crazy.  We can not finish our food, so we asked them take away. But they throw our thing and our food box on the table with impolite face.  Their services is nothing."

14 Wall Street,40,Oily grill fish,"One dish only at VD170,000 per person, serve on a mini cooking plate with boiling oil, the dish is quite special but consider expensive base compare to local food, restaurant is on the second floor and need to walk up via narrow staircase"

14 Wall Street,10,Wow!,"Four of us, visited this restaurant on 12-14 Cha Ca St, Old Quarter.  Up the dinghy lit wooden stairs. Crowded scene. Serves only one type of food... = must be damn good?  Oh well, fish soaking in oil in a pan. Local greens on the side and bowl of rice noodles.  Cost VND170k per pax.  No words exchange. No eye contact. No service.  We watched how the locals ate them, and followed.  HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED."

14 Wall Street,10,Grilled Fish Rip-off!,"We will NEVER come back to this restaurant again!  The fish was mediocre and ordinary, it was swimming in butter and what was worse was we told them VERY CLEARLY that we only wanted ONE ORDER (140,000 dong) of the only item in their menu (we just had a banh mi snack 1 hr prior to dinner because the restaurant was still closed).    As mentioned, the signature & only dish was just okay, definitely NOT exceptional. AND THE BIG UNPLEASANT SURPRISE WAS OUR BILL WAS FOR 2 ORDERS! They insisted that the fish in the pan was for 2 ORDERS, but truly, the portions were so tiny that we would’ve been famished if we didn’t have the banh mi beforehand.    We have climbed other second-floor restaurants in Hanoi, but this one is definitely a hazard to old and young customers alike! The stairs were steep, the lights were dim the steps were barely enough for one’s shoes and the stairs were at a 25-degree angle- and barely 24 inches wide! I’m not exaggerating, but I was scared I would fall  and hurt myself!    So, with the awful climb upstairs and the mediocre fish, that’s the last time we will visit this restaurant! 😤😤😤👎👎👎    M DUNCAN"

14 Wall Street,10,not worth,"for an signatur dish this was very disappointing. the idea behind the dish is great but, for me as an chef, the reality looks very poor."

14 Wall Street,40,The original cha ca,"It is the original cha ca,located at no 14, cha ca street,the street name after the dish.but beware of another cha ca la vong,it used no 14 too,but different place.the original one dont use 14 cha ca as sign,so if you see the shop sign like 14 cha ca or something,then it is another one.anyway,the original one is not very luxury look,it is very normal place.so you may miss it.they sell one dish only,that is cha ca the grill fish.it is a traditional northern vietnam food,you hardly find it in the south.the price for one person is VND170,000,(cannot share),not cheap.the marinated fish in hot pan will arrive at the table, alongside a basket of think vermicelli, fresh herbs, roasted peanuts, chili.it may oily,but the taste is good,and the portion not big,so make it a bit expensive. service is nothing special to say,but ok,the staff or owner wont ignore you,due to language barrier,they dont speak much,instead,they will do everything for you,so order is not a problem.if you are the first time in Hanoi,this place still worth a visit,at least try once."

14 Wall Street,30,Tasty and interesting experience,"Full of locals which is always a good sign, the food was tasty and the novelty of cooking the fish and herbs yourself on a burner is fun.    However, this restaurant is really aimed at locals and takes tourists for a bit of a ride. Although not expensive by Western standards, it becomes very apparent that they’re charging you 3-4 times what they’re charging the locals for what felt like an overly small portion.    While it seems somewhat petty to complain over 6K VND (25 cents), they added this to the bill for wet wipes that they gave us without asking. Knowing that they’d already charged ya a lot more than locals this felt galling.    Finally, although the food came very quickly service was otherwise non existent - the English speaking member of staff did nothing to be proactive and only explained the meal and process after we had flagged him down and asked several times."

14 Wall Street,40,One of the best specialty in Hanoi but I like the food cooked by coal before,"I have spent my time for meal in this restaurant now and then. It is the oldest restaurant in Hanoi (more than 130 years old). In my humble opinion, I prefer the old style of this restaurant when they cooked the grilled fish by coal. Nowadays, they have used glue instead of coal for fire. It's more convenient than before; however, I figure that it is not enough heat for grilling first and onion. The price is not cheap."

14 Wall Street,40,"Not Fancy, not the best attention but its good","We've been in this restaurant several times and all the reviews you can read are true. The attention is not good, it is not fancy at all (the room where you eat is like a cantine but the Cha ca is much better than in other restaurants much better noted in tripadvisor. So yes, we like it"

14 Wall Street,10,Never ever coming back,Food is over rated. Expensive. Not value for money. Totally no service at all. We don't owe them a living. They forgot.

14 Wall Street,30,Expensive and just ok,"The fish was nice enough, but really nothing to get excited about. They were so busy, we felt quite ignored. It was confusing as westerners to establish exactly what we had purchased. For 3 people and 3 beers, over 750.000.a nice local experience but be prepared for the $$$"

14 Wall Street,10,Maybe a traditional restaurant but the place is a rip-off!,"My wife and me are just back from this place which we innocently tried out! We were astonished of no explanations or menu and only one dish served, which is a marinated fish with cold noodles and some fresh herbs. Really nothing special and as many say here say much too greasy. Ok, service was also very bad and we thought maybe no English knowledges. But when the bill came I nearly fell from the chair -170.000 per person! Only because the dish was famous 100 years ago. We eat in other places a rich and good seafood barbecue for 100.000!  Once we opened the door of our hotel room my wife started vomiting!  Please, never ever go there and make a big curve around this scam place."

14 Wall Street,50,delicious Cha Ca,"This is the oldest Cha Ca restaurant on Cha Ca street, and maybe Hanoi! It is a bit pricey at 150,000 but is well worth the money! The server cooks the catfish in turmeric and dill at your table! It is such a wonderful experience for all the senses!"

14 Wall Street,10,Overly priced for bad,"Only one dish in this restaurant and it cost 170,000VND per person! The portion was so small it can’t fill any stomach. And there’s a lot of locals there. We suspect local and tourist are priced differently! Horrible service as well. Avoid at all cost ! .. the taste and the price doesn’t match! The photo below is portion for 2."

14 Wall Street,40,Beware of decoy Cha Ca restaurant on same street!,"This is my first time writing a review but felt compelled to do so. I had wanted to try this famous restaurant which only serves one dish ""cha Ca"" - a fried tumeric marinated dish. It is so good that the restaurant only serves this one dish and nothing else! I tracked this down with google maps but it lead me to a restaurant pertaining to be this restaurant on the same street. It had brash signs and neon flashes proclaiming it to be number 1 for cha ca. we sat down and ordered only this dish, but it was awful. We left disappointed but was slightly suspicious that for a famous restaurant it was empty. We walked a few yards further and on the same street on the opposite side we stumbled on the original Cha Ca La Vong establised 1871 at number 14. It looked really inconspicuous and sure enough the only dish they served was Cha Ca. The difference was remarkable, the dish was fresh, had a distinctive flavour and was quite pleasant. The decoy restaurant had the audacity to charge more for this dish! Their business model is clearly to capitalise on the reputation from the other establishment as they blatant flash no 14 signs and stating they are 'no 1 for Cha ca' it doesnt even make any sense they use the number 14 when they are not at number 14! To tell the difference, the real restaurant has a stairway as you come in on the left leading up to the two floors of dining space whereas the decoy restaurant is one floor and have pictures of other dishes they served. The real restaurant only serves one dish!! We only tried the Cha Ca in both but the real one tasted so much better. No wonder the decoy which empty!! The audacity of the cowboys to charge a higher price for the Cha Ca. Also they cook the dish on an induction heater whereas the original use a gas burner. There are some disappointed reviews on this restaurant at number 14, clearly at the wrong restauant with induction heaters!! Oh well, i give them credit for their audacity but felt compelled to write this review as it is not right!"

14 Wall Street,20,Trading on its reputation,"Like many I came here on a food critics recommendation.it may once have been good but now it’s mostly indifferent.service is surly and unhelpful ( in huge contrast to almost everywhere else in Hanoi) surprise surprise the ‘free’ beer isn’t,and it was warm as well. Grilled fish isn’t,it is served in chunks in a ladleful of cheap oil in a pan with some raggedy dill stalks and a mound of rice noodles ( of course,noodles are cheap)and some indifferent sauces.i had to ask twice for chilli and limes (normal on all Vietnamese tables) and was distinctly unimpressed with the offering.ifyou’d nevereaten In Vietnam you might enjoy it,but when you have you will know it’s massively overpriced and not that great.significantly there were no Vietnamese eating there at all- why would they?step outside you can pay half the price,get cold beer and eat far better.please,do not give your hard earned money to this joint,there are plenty more places who work far harder and cook much better."

14 Wall Street,50,Delicious goodness,"Fresh herbs, great combination with fried fish, fish sauce, crunchy peanut, soft and delicious rice noodle!"

14 Wall Street,30,"Serves one dish. And it's good. Everything else is crummy in this old, rickety restaurant. Bad service. But i love it.","Serves one dish. And it's good. Everything else is crummy in this old, rickety restaurant. Bad service. But i love it."

14 Wall Street,10,Terrible,"I'd read so many recommendations about this place that I didn't check it out on TripAdvisor. What a mistake. Indifferent service, bland, dull overpriced food. Advertisement at the front offers free beer (which should have been a clue as to the quality) but we were charged for both ou warm beers and even when challenged. Please, don't go."

14 Wall Street,30,Old traditional house serving cha ca,"My favourite dish is cha ca and I heard lots about this century old shop, La Vong at 14 Cha Ca Street, i saw many other post of la cong and they are many fakes.    Though simple dish, but it's flavourful and I simple love it with noodles. There isn't service here since they only have a couple serving. Serving portion compared to others are smaller, lesser greenies.    Well at least I tried, I still prefer the one at duong thang. Give it a try if u happen to be near by and climb that super steep steps up to level 2. Distinct feature is that cyan blue wall!"

14 Wall Street,40,aka Cha Ca La Vong,"As at many specialty restaurants in Hanoi, they ONLY do ONE dish, and they do it well. No menus, just sauteed fish in turmeric, vermicelli noodles and herbs. Wait staff will confirm the number of diners, and then the food is delivered. Finish cooking at your table and devour. Good solid meal. Note the stairs to the second floor dining room are steep."

14 Wall Street,10,MOST TERRIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE EVER: bad fish and Food Poisioning,"NUMBER ONE GRILLED FISH at 14 Cha Ca Hanoi was the worst experience that i have ever experienced at any restaurant . We ordered the ""Grilled Fish"" which turned about to be fried, not grilled, greasy meat. The restaurant owners cheated us by charging high prices for Grilled Fish when they did not serve grilled fish. We got food poisoning from dining here. In the USA or Canada this restaurant would be most certainly shut down for health reasons. Going to this restaurant was the most terrible dining experience that I have ever experienced."

14 Wall Street,30,Once an iconic restaurant for Cha Ca,"Once 'the' place for Cha Ca, but I won't be visiting here again. Too many good Cha Ca restaurants with better food, quality, access and most of all, service."

14 Wall Street,10,Tourist trap!,"We visited this restaurant as it was the first to start Cha Ca, but boy were we disappointed. I went there with my boyfriend and wanted a light snack. The boss tried to push us to get the set for 2 which would come up to 400k for 2 person. I chose to go with the 100k for the fish and some fish cake (for 30k according to the menu). They delivered the 2 dishes, and pops both into the frying pan after pointing to the menu indicating what it was. What I didn’t realize was that each fish cake was 30k and he brought us 12 fish cakes! We didn’t finish it. Taste wise it was oily beyond believe! Price wise... be prepared to be fleeced! We paid 490k in total for absolutely rubbish."

14 Wall Street,10,Uninspiring and overpriced,"Supposed to be a complete gem, we had not looked on here, rather read guidebooks, and I can confirm it is as poor as others have said. It was more expensive than I have paid for any meal in Vietnam, small portion, uninspiring and yes the beer that looked to be ‘free’ wasn’t. As well as that it was warm! Can’t see any reason to come here at all folks"

14 Wall Street,10,Run away now,"Bad and rude service. Tasteless mulch of unidentifiable fish parts cooked by man picking nose and served with old limp bunch of herbs. Run now, don’t walk away - run."

14 Wall Street,10,"Tasty fish, terrible service","We went here since it was the first to develop Cha Ca. The servers were nasty, ignored us, never brought us our drinks or napkins. The waiter dropped a card on the table that said (we serve on dish—170VD). There are better places for Cha Ca and definitely places with nicer service."

14 Wall Street,10,Good taste and bad taste,"Good taste - still consistent in terms of taste, cucumin flavoured fish  Bad taste - overpriced - 170k VND for one person, no service, too little fish (if I really want to filled my dinner stomach I probably spend 1M VND)!    P.S. I went to the original one...they rely on their long history of reputation but this place is losing its shine, what a shame."

14 Wall Street,20,Chả Cá Lã Vọng,It doesn’t taste good like it used to. Also the service is too bad. I sure will never come back here.

14 Wall Street,10,ひどい客対応 Horrible Cust Service,"詳しい人におすすめしないよ、と言われても元祖ということで入ってみましたが、ガッカリを超える腹立たしい対応でした。 うちは魚のグリルを170kドンで出すだけだというカードを投げつけられ、ブンは切らずにどんと出される。ピーナッツを出してこない。ハーブは自分で入れろとまるで看守に命令されるように顎と箸で指示される。火の調整など一切なく野菜は焦げる。その上、後から来たグループ用の取り皿を僕のテーブルで仕分け始める。 たべてる最中に、コンロを下げる。という劣悪な対応にガンと文句を言って出てきた！ 文句をいう地元民も外国人はいないのであろうか？ ぺこぺこお辞儀をし始めたがこのふざけた対応に断固抗議した。    チャーカータンロンに行くべき！ 魚の量も不満なく、ブンはチョキチョキ切ってくれ、一皿目はよそってくれるので、わかりやすい。    Go Cha Ca Than Long, where better food and services are provided at competitive price.    This joint did nearly insulting service by directing me what to do by pointing their chin with no words. No bun cutting prior to cooking then they reluctantly cut the bun with a pair of scissors upon realizing that the bun was like a canon ball."

14 Wall Street,50,"one and only dish, and it is fantastic","read about the place. We went up the stairs, sat down, a card told us it was fixed price, we ordered a beer and enjoyed the best fish meal in Old Hanoi. Turmeric fish, with vermicelli and greens and cook it at your table. Loved it."

14 Wall Street,50,This place is more commonly known as Cha Ca La Vong,"And it’s the original. Housed in an old and original family home. Downstairs is the altar room and family room, up stairs (they’re steep, be careful) is the small communal dining room. Fish grilled right at your plate is the main item on the menu, and there are not many other items on the menu, yiunpointnat the picture on the menu,mit arrives as your table shortly after.mit’s yummy and worth the trip.    Tables are communal, mostly, but you can dine solo if you go off hours. Servers not really geared to English clientele ... they’re not surly, exactly, just focused on trying to execute their job with customers who they cannot understand."

14 Wall Street,10,tourist rip-off - overpriced and unpleasant experience,"we were tempted to try the grilled fish - which proved to be not good value for money, the serving for three would have been enough for only two, rather careless slammed on the table in front of us. taste was okay but nothing special. definitely not worth 200.000 dong!    the bad surprise came when we wanted to pay and found out that the ""free beer"" which was advertised to accompany the grilled fish was NOT included. we pointed out that it is fraud to use a blatant to lure customers in - the very unfriendly bully of owner could not have cared less and even shouted at us. the first time we were ripped off in such a manner after months of travelling in vietnam. :-(  NEVER AGAIN!!"

14 Wall Street,20,"Average food, terrible service","The food here is average, a lot of oil and not much fish. The service is whats killing this place, they completely ignore you and even charge for napkins... maybe just 1 star.."

14 Wall Street,20,avoid,"I don't need 100 characters to tell you my opinion of this place . 4 characters are enough : AVOID .  We were tempted to eat here by by a television ""Foudie"" show . Big mistake : Poor food , poor service , poor environment . Don't !!!"

14 Wall Street,40,Tasty - Historic - Way Overpriced,"To start with, this is an ""experience"" restaurant. It's not the most delicious or the best price. In fact, it's way overpriced!! I'd heard that the service was really poor but I didn't find it to be poor - just not friendly. So, if you're looking for a western-style meal with western-style service, this isn't the place for you. But, if you're looking to taste a part of Vietnamese history, experience a little culture and spend USD 7.30 (yup, that's still overpriced), stop on by.    Apparently, this is the oldest restaurant in Hanoi of this style - this grilled fish thing. It dates back to the French colonial days (which, frankly ended in the 1950s so it's not necessarily old in the scheme of Vietnam.) The legend goes that the restaurant owners sheltered Vietnamese nationalist freedom fighters who were fighting the French and therefore has an enduring bond with the current government and military.    Either way, you go through what feels like someone's living room up a tiny narrow and steep set of stairs to a rather unremarkable dining room. If you aren't Vietnamese, someone will put a little card on your table telling you that there is only one option and that the price is (currently) 170,000 VTD - drinks not included. If you continue to sit, they will just start putting things in front of you - without speaking. They bring out the fish which is already mostly cooked and then show you how to add vegetables and sort of finish the dish at your table. I thought it was very good but it really wasn't a lot of fish - mostly noodle - but that's local custom.    All in all, I found this to be an interesting experience."

14 Wall Street,10,Worst ever fish,"This restaurant was recommended from my Airbnb host quoted as ""must try before you die"" fish. Scammed!    You were told there's only one dish in the restaurant and I was thinking you better be a killing dish for this price. We were served with a pan full of boiling oil and the staff dump some pre-cook fish small fillet in with spring onion and dill. First the fish is small, second it is not fresh, third it was instantly over cooked under the fierceful fire under the pan.    The service was bad, room was very hot, and it is very expensive for what you get. Any one can cook a better fish than this."

14 Wall Street,30,First try ever,"The dish of fish is so savory and fresh; its taste is quite special maybe because of the herbs. My family and I have tried it for the very first time and we loved it. However, its price is too high and the service is quite bad :(  We hope it would be better in the next time if we could go back again :)"

14 Wall Street,50,The best fish ever!,"I haven't been a huge fan of fish since forever. I went on a 9 day trip to Vietnam alone, and I enjoyed every bit of it. My main aim is food, when I travel. Had all sorts of meats the first 8 days of my trip and did not touch fish. I did a lot of research and fund out that this dish must be tried. Not sure why but it just so happened that I saved this for the last day. I entered and saw mostly locals, which means it must be good, I thought. The owner served me herself because she saw I was alone. she explained the dish to me and slowly one by one plates/bowls started filing up my table! I thought to myself that oh man, thats alot of food for one person. Ideally the rice noodles and dill is shared, atleast for 2. But one is started I didn't stop.....the fish was perfectly cooked and flavors well balanced. All my bowls where EMPTY. Thats how good it was. Must try."

14 Wall Street,10,Tourist Trap,"Don't waste your time, energy and money checking out this restaurant (even though it's the original one). It is a scam! The serving was a very small portion of thin and tiny cut pieces of fish and some vegetables and noodles at 170,000 vnd per person. We left the restaurant hungry and determined to share our lousy experience with fellow travellers."

14 Wall Street,10,it is a scam,do not go to the store one with big yellow sign and big number 14. we got scamed at this one 400000 for 2people. very little fish. the owner （probably a gang member）strongly recommend us to order fish cake （30000 per piece）we said one but they give us 12 piece. we thought one piece might mean one dish. but it is not. when we ask for the bill they charged us 30000x12 plus 400000 whice is very over priced. we did not even finish the cake. we try to reason with the owner. finally they agreed to give us a cheapper price. when we got home we checked online. there is plenty of other scam in vietnam. strongly not recommend you to go to vietnam. very bad experience here.

14 Wall Street,20,Stay away!,"We went to this place on recommendation of our tour guide. My bad for not checking the reviews on TripAdvisor. The food is OK, nothing special IMO, they gave us one small pot with about 15 small pieces of fish for 3 person, noodles, some greens and small sauce plates. Might pass as an appetizer for 3. It came to 550k with a couple of beers. You can order double or triple portion if are hungry, but 170k each it will cost you."

14 Wall Street,10,Very BAAAAAAAAAAD!,This place was recommended to us on our hotel map. Just be very very careful Casie there is 2 places with the same name and the same number address! It is a massive scam as we clearly got the world place. They make you get a set menu thing for 2 but also get these fish cake things and nothing was great at all and then they charge something astronomical for Vietnamese pricing. It’s toatlly not worth it when you can get great cheap fresh food in every other restaurant! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!

Aix,50,One of the best restaurants ever!,"We enjoyed an amazing meal beginning with an amuse bouche, starter, main entré and a desert. Each course was amazing. Definitely one of the best restaurants I’ve ever enjoyed."

Aix,50,On repeat….,"We met friends for dinner. Our meals were amazing. Wine was paired perfectly. Loved it so much we went back two days later. It didn’t disappoint. Between us, over two nights we tried the entire menu. Best dining experience in Aix. It’s a must. The tastings offered before the entree are a sensation and create a welcoming atmosphere. Loved the staff."

Aix,50,Excellent restaurant make sure you make a reservation.,"Be sure to make a reservation if you want to sit outside; seating outside is extremely limited and while the inside seemed nice enough, you will want to sit outside as the people watching and ambiance of the pedestrian-only street makes eating here super worthwhile. Loved the food. One thing to note, very likely you may have to slow down your server, as they clearly wanted the outdoor seats back as soon as they could, and, of course, all you will want to do is sit back and enjoy the meal and the ambiance. Favorite meal in Aix."

Aix,50,Excellent Experience,Great service...we ate inside even though it was a nice night. Recommended a wine...excellent Pace of dinner - great Overall our favorite dinner in AIX

Aix,50,"Excellent restaurant, great food",Family of 5 adults and one baby had dinner here. All had €58 set menu. Excellent food. Amuse-bouche were lovely. Tuna ceviche excellent. In fact all food excellent. Service friendly. Highly recommended

Aix,50,Memorably Good,Excellent. Service was somewhat aloof; food was excellent. The lovely evening was very slightly diminished by the American girls seated next to us; trying to experience this dining through live streaming and dueling selfies. I suspect their parents were nearby ruining dinner for someone else at a restaurant nearby.

Aix,50,Perfection!,"We tried Mitch out while walking around Aix and so glad we did. We returned on our last night and were greeted like old friends. The food is exquisit. The menu is limited, but this is more than compensated for the incredible taste, colour and quality of the food. The staff are professional, but warm and friendly. Looking forward to returning!"

Aix,50,My new favorite restaurant in the south of France!!,"For three weeks my husband and I traveled throughout the south of france. And in that time, we had (without exception) excellent meals everywhere.    However, our dinner took excellence to a whole new level. Far and away, this was probably one of the best dining experiences I've had anywhere in the world.    The atmosphere of the restaurant is wonderfully charming, which simple white walls and comfortable white chairs. We were fortunate enough to secure one of the 4-5 outdoor tables, which was outstanding as the restaurant is on a corner with plenty of foot traffic for people watching and a lovely square with a fountain right across the street.    The service was perfection! Our hostess was also our waitress and she was friendly, attentive, helpful, and knowledgable...everything one could want in a professional and more. She was always available, explained what each course was and made sure that our every need was met.    We had the tasting menu, which at 58€/pp was an outstanding value. The menu clearly shows the chef's creativity and there were multiple items at each course. My husband and I intentionally ordered different items at each course to view and taste all of the possibilities.    And the food is clearly the star of this show, and it doesn't disappoint. I don't know how but each course outdid the proceeding course. Every course was beautifully presented and perfectly season/prepared with the most amazing balance of textures, flavors and smells ever.    I can't wait to go back and know that the meal I have then will be perfection again!! Thank you!!"

Aix,40,Didn't live up to our expectations,"I'm a bit baffled by all the raving reviews. The food was good but definitely not great. It was good enough, which is not enough for France.  My friend and I had fish as the main course, The cod was very good but the bream was not to our liking. It was tough and tasted fishy. I don't know if that was that particular bream or bream in general, but we stayed away from bream the rest of our trip because of our experience. The rest of our meals were fine but not great.  On a positive side, the restaurant is located in a very nice spot and sitting outside was a pleasure."

Aix,50,Beyond exceptional,"We had booked another restaurant and were informed that they were closed on Sundays. I called Mitch and booked a table without issue (glad I did, as they were turning people away while we were there). As others have said Mitch is outstanding in every way: the food, presentation and service were top notch and we couldn't recommend it more highly!  We opted for the Prix Fixe menu. After a selection of amuse bouche we started with the Chicken Broth with Foie Gras and Pan Fried Octopus. Entrees of a perfectly cooked piece of beef and Sous Vide chicken were outstanding as were the desserts of a deconstructed lemon meringue tart and ripe strawberries with a vanilla and verbena cream. The food is amazing and the service equally so.  We had such a fantastic meal here and can't say enough about it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Aix,50,Exceptional!!,"Exceptional! After eating here on night 2 of our trip we only wanted to return. Luckily there was a cancellation and we were able to come back. Service was impeccable, ambience terrific and the food is of the highest quality and creativity. Thank you for a special experience during our stay!"

Aix,50,"Fantastic food, friendly staff in a fun, characterful ‘place’ in Aix","Probably our best meals in Aix, we went twice - the second time with friends who loved it as we did. Book early if you fancy going as we had to…and we saw lots of people turned away who arrived on the nights we were there.    Food was an innovative and tasty twist on meat, fish & veggie dishes. Tender beef, fantastic sea-bream & sardine, and some of the best strawberries we had in France.    Good selection of wines including some nice local ones like Richaume Cuvee Tradition rouge at a sensible price.    Book now, you won’t regret it!"

Aix,50,Best in Aix,"The best, and most relaxing meals I've had during this two-week stay in France. Absolutely my favorite dining experience in Aix-en-Provence. This is Michelin star quality food in an easy and relaxed atmosphere, presented without any pretension at very reasonable prices. It's the kind of place that invites you to sit and linger over your food. Enjoy."

Aix,50,Delicious!,"Delicious! We ate in the lower level with the view of a 500-year old well. The set and a la carte manus are very/too similar; bu thankfully what we ate was delicious. No disappointment (except olives were not mentioned as a key ingredient in the English version of the menu). Nice local wines. And, super staff."

Aix,50,Wonderful clever cooking and a lovely ambience,"We met a lovely couple at another restaurant a few days before who told us we had to go to Mitch. We are so glad we did! The tasting menu was fabulous and great value for such fabulous ingredients and expert cooking. The asparagus starter, our beef fillet main and rhubarb dessert all had real stand out touches. Service here is personal and exceptional and just a great balance of formal/informal that few restaurants do well. My husband was a food reviewer for many years and felt that this was one of the best meals we'd had in a very long time."

Aix,50,Best choice in Aix en Provence. Perfect dinner with perfect atmosphere,The best restaurant we ate in Provence during our 12 days there (including star Michelin we were). The kitchen is creative and the harmony of tastes are perfect. Wide enough choice for everybody. Every dish made us say Wow! Mitch is very attentive and explains on every dish also on English. Decent variety of wines with fair prices. The meal is also fair priced.

Alain Ducasse,50,Magical,"Everything about our experience was top class. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. Our sommelier was the best I've ever met. The wine choices were unique and interesting. The food was inventive, exquisite and of course, delicious. The tasting menu had such variety that each course was a wonderful surprise. I can't thank everyone enough for making our visit so magical."

Alain Ducasse,50,Worth the rating,"It was a true Michelin 3 experience. Incredibly comfortable and inviting. The staff was warm, personable and very engaging. Absolutely no complaints."

Alain Ducasse,50,It Was Far More Than Dinner - It Was A Once In A Lifetime Experience!!!,"This was the greatest dining experience I’ve ever had. The atmosphere, service and food were absolutely fantastic. I was their for a birthday celebration and the Staff went far out of their way to make it a very special evening. We had the wine pairing with 7 course tasting menu and it was spectacular."

Alain Ducasse,50,Nice :),Nicly done. Testing manu perfect with wone dinning - everybody should try this experience. We try this restaurant several times - always good :)

Alain Ducasse,50,No competition. Sadly.,"No competition. Sadly.    I visit quite a lot of restaurants in London (and in Europe) from Bib to 3*. In brief, JP Blondet at Ducasse and his team on the floor are trading way above the competition here in London in their category, at the moment. For ex. was at a world’s famous 3* restaurant a few weeks ago in Chelsea, and it just is not “boxing in the same category”.    Some 3* should secretly visit this Dorchester “auberge” and see what’s like to make a client feel so at ease/comfortable you just do not want to leave either because of the cuisine or because the staff is so professional (they have a new RM, a young, very pro and may I say, very attractive lady!).    With prices so high now in London (funny how 1* restaurants are now roughly GPB 100+, 2* GBP 200 and 3* GBP 300 excl. wines), those restaurants better be not just good but excellent, out of this world.    An example? I had a coffee/cream-based desert in my 3*Chelsea restaurant in early July, the type of desert that it is easy to prepare well ahead of customers coming at 1815. Yep! 1815! No choice! Who wants a coffee/creamy based desert on a hot Saturday of July? Seasons? Who cares? What are they going to serve in November? Even the Ritz changed their excellent souffle to adapt to the current season! But a 3* In Chelsea ? No!!! Who the pastry chef works for? Customers? 😊 You must be joking! They should be so lucky to have the privilege to dine in our restaurant I hear them saying….    Do those restaurants think they can keep on charging those prices with those practices and keep their ratings….?    So yes I am not going to continue to pay GBP 300 for a restaurant whose staff on the floor and in the kitchen are working for themselves instead of working for clients like in this Chelsea-based eatery.    Here I had a cherry-based desert and my friend a strawberry. Seasons fruits. Season deserts. Yes more risks of wasting fragile strawberries or cherries… No risk of wasting coffee beans true…..Your P&L is safe...    The cuisine here is innovative, I tasted some excellent langoustines in a cold consommé, a Scottish wagyu beef with a great jus, highly refined and highly technical in my view etc…    Prices have gone up and now dining in London is really expensive. Some restaurants will be able to stay competitive. That’s the case here. Not certain for many restaurants. I am not very optimistic for those high end restaurants that require customers to come on Saturday eve a 0615, and be out by 0930 whilst serving dishes that are so “ready-to-serve” by the Kitchen/floor staff so they can get out and have their evening for “only” GBP 500 per head inc. VAT… Well no thank you.    Again not the case here.    Not cheap but thankfully, here you could almost say this is great value for money. Almost! 😊"

Alain Ducasse,40,"Recommend, however…","Having dined here before we were looking forward to another wonderful experience with a journey through amazing creative culinary delights and impeccable service that you would would expect from a three star. However the sparkle is not quite as it once was, the food was delicious and beautifully prepared but a little lacking in creativity and the service was not three star attentive service from all the front of house (some training issue’s possibly?). I have eaten more creative food and had far more attentive service at Sketch and Helene Darroze. Wine pairings and non alcoholic pairings with the tasting menu were also not mentioned at all which was rather odd? Overall the whole experience felt a little lacklustre and lacking that three star experience you would expect. Maybe an off night with new staff but at that level there should not be any off nights!!"

Alain Ducasse,40,:A Gracious Evening Marred by A Few Glittering Missteps,"The occasion of my birthday guided us to grace the opulent interiors of a restaurant which we’ve had the privilege to experience before. In its magnificent splendour and culinary prowess, it had previously managed to leave us awestruck, an experience that etched a permanent memory in our hearts. This visit, while mostly splendid, revealed a subtle diminution in its previously undoubted sparkle and grandeur.    The fare, it must be said, remained as exceptional as ever, a testament to the culinary maestros behind the scenes. Each dish was a cornucopia of flavours, an exploration of the delicate artistry that has rightly earned this establishment its coveted place among the top 3 Michelin-starred restaurants globally.    However, certain unexpected glitches did mildly tarnish our evening. Upon expressing my preference for a teetotal evening, my wife duly requested a non-alcoholic cocktail menu for me. To our dismay, this detail, as seemingly insignificant as it may be for some, was overlooked. Inexplicably, this led to an all-encompassing assumption that our table had opted for an abstemious evening. Despite my wife’s order of a Campari and soda from another steward, the concept of wine pairings was not broached thereafter.    A redeeming feature was the delightful young lady who enthusiastically explained the intricacies of the tasting menu. Her insightful knowledge, coupled with her keen willingness to accommodate my daughter’s dietary needs, was a refreshing example of attentive service.    In the spirit of the occasion, I elected to adorn my dishes with black truffles, an additional indulgence I was keen to treat myself to. Regrettably, this augmentation was overlooked, resulting in an absence of the anticipated truffle infusion.    In summation, while our visit was generally delightful, it lacked the breathtaking ‘wow’ factor we had come to associate with this prestigious establishment. Regardless, we remain hopeful that future visits will recapture the immaculate brilliance and meticulous attention to detail that this esteemed restaurant is renowned for."

Alain Ducasse,50,Amazing,"Having dined previously at other 3 and 2 starred restaurants (eg Helene Darozze, Gordan Ramsay, Waterside Inn) my wife and I both agreed that this was the best by far in terms of food and service. Obviously at a price but you know the drill when you book here…"

Alain Ducasse,50,Unbelievable Experience,"Absolutely superb! The decor and the food and the service were just Alain Ducasse again, proved his exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey! The waiters were very polite and descriptive in their food presentation. The staff were all smiles and made us feel very special. It was a very special dinning experience in Monaco."

Alain Ducasse,40,Return visit… good but lacking full 3 Michelin star finesse,"I’ve always felt that AD@Dorchester has been underrated in London - it’s consistently had 3 Michelin stars for an exceptionally long time and is relatively easy to find a table at. However my most recent visit was ever so slightly disappointing. Objectively, a great dinner - we had the full tasting with the top wine flight pairings - but there were too many imperfections for this to really be 3 Michelin stars. Small things like sloppily placed cutlery, inconsistent table service and long waits for attention - not a huge deal, and certainly first world problems, but all added to a sense that the restaurant was lacking that ultimate polish. Feels more like a place to go for fine dining tourists and instagrammers. Having said that, my wife and I both enjoyed the meal."

Alain Ducasse,50,Great dinner and outstanding service,A lovely dinner with the tasting menu and wine pairings. It does last a long time (4 hours) but it was filled with creative food and great service. their communications pre arrival helped with one in our group who had a food allergy. great restaurant

Alain Ducasse,30,Where did everyone go?,"I took my wife here to celebrate our 46 th Wedding Anniversary while in town for the Chelsea Flower Show. The initial meal and service was as one would expect but then everyone disappeared! we were seated near the street in an area away from the main dining room with two significant pillars blocking the view but with 3 other tables sharing the space. After finishing our mains, we sat for 35 minutes awaiting clearance of dishes and desert menus. We finally succeeded in signaling for the bill. While I can appreciate that some restaurants struggle with staffing, this clearly was not the issue here. There was plenty of staff but the pillars block their view of these tables and as the restaurant was nearly full their attention drifted away from us. A sad and disappointing end to what started out well but petered out dismally. What a shame."

Alain Ducasse,50,Truly exceptional ♥️,"Quality and service which you would expect at a three Michelin star restaurant. A wonderful culinary journey from start to end - dishes served at the start had clean and refreshing flavours, followed on with bold, meaty flavours. Ended with cheese course and a beautiful sorbet dessert. At the end of the service, my partner was given a chocolate gift, very thoughtful!    It was the perfect place to celebrate a special birthday."

Alain Ducasse,10,Poor service,"I visited Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester for my birthday with my wife. We had the tasting menu and the food was exquisite apart for the fish that wasn't anything special nor tasty. We very much enjoyed the medallion lobster, the scallop and the he venison.    The service however was a big let down for a 3-stars Michelin restaurant. We had a glass of champagne when we sat and the sommelier put maybe 50ml in my wife's glass while my glass was filled normally. I never saw that in any restaurant in the world, regardless of their price or how many Michelin stars they have. That was a bad way to start the diner and spoiled a bit the good feel factor of the arrival. The total bill for 2 tasting menus, 2 glasses of champagne at the beginning and half-bottle champagne during the diner was £561.    When we left and got our jackets, I noticed my Louis Vuitton pin wasn't on my jacket anymore. I told the staff and they started looking on the floor for it. I ended up finding it after a while, but not the whole pin, the back was still missing. That was rather annoying to see. I was told they are going to keep looking for it and that I would be contacted. I wasn't and after some days I got in touch with them. At first they were dismissive and when I told them I'm not happy with the way they're treating this a manager then called me. They told me they're still looking for the back part but I'm not expecting it to find it.    To spend above £500 on a diner and then to be disrespected I find unpardonable. I'm not going back there again."

Alain Ducasse,50,Exceptional meal,We booked this restaurant as a double birthday celebration and our first three star michelin restaurant. We were not disappointed quite simply the best meal I have ever eaten. We picked the tasting menu with a wine flight and when the first course came out I knew we were going to be in for a beautiful meal. The lobster dish was stunning and the wine choices complimented the food. The real highlight was getting to go into the kitchen and meet Jean- Philippe the executive chef.    Worth every penny and I'm so glad we picked here for our first three star meal.

Alain Ducasse,50,Simply world-class!,"This was a perfect eveing from the start to the end! First of all the service and ambience is perfect - from the first interaction at the entrace all through the evening! Friendly, super professional, knowledgable and yet a little nice ”french formal” service to make it an evening to remember. We had the Tasing Menue and its a perfect choice, well balanced dishes presented in a perfect way - simply world class food. We did not go for the wine menue instead we selected wine and aperetifs from the excellent and extensive wine list - simply perfect! All in all a world class fine dining experience with world class service. If you once in your life want to dine at a three star restaurant this one should be high up on your go-to-list!!!"

Alain Ducasse,20,Very bad booking experience (for a £610 restaurant gift voucher),"Rarely do I find the time to write a review so it has to be about an extraordinarily good or bad experience.    I contacted the reservation team for Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester on Wednesday evening as I wanted to offer a gift certificate for a total value of £610 for a decade birthday that happened the next day.    I was explained that I needed to fill a PDF form, either with a specialized piece of software or by printing it then scanning it, in a much outdated fashion, and that I also needed to fill my payment information on a form on a website, even though the payment would be made later, in as much of an outdated manner. I wonder if all their clients need to be computer science engineers to be able to follow these parallel procedures. Everything could have been handled with a single online page with an instantaneous payment form.    The same evening I dutifully filled the PDF form and sent the payment information. I was told they would check both the form and the payment information on Thursday and that they would send the voucher at the latest on Friday morning.    This Friday afternoon I called my relative that was supposed to receive it and he hadn't. I then checked my mailbox and saw that the reservation team had sent me an email asking me to send the form, as if I had sent nothing!    I called them, and after much difficulty in trying to get someone from that team—being told that the restaurant was closed even though the reservations team is supposed to be open before—, I was told to call after 6PM and ended up being called back before that.    The agent coldly told me that they did not receive the email and did not seem concerned to look through their spam folder, even though I was in a cab and it was impractical for me to work with email before the office closed. Considering I didn't receive any delivery error message, I am doubtful that they didn't receive it. I eventually forwarded the initial email that contained the form, using my smartphone.    Later this evening I finally received an email from a new person, the reservations manager, saying that everything was in order and asking me whether they should wait for the next weekday, on Monday, before sending the gift certificate that was planned for “tomorrow”! The “tomorrow Thursday“ from my email on Wednesday, had become a next week… Apparently my request hadn't been transferred to her with the proper context of a lost email and being already late.    When I read and replied to this aggravating email 30 minutes later, I received an out-of-office email: “the reservations office is currently closed and will reopen on Saturday 12th November 2022”, which is 8 days later! (Why would they close for so long?) They hadn't bothered to call me to get my answer to this irrelevant question for which I apparently had only a few minutes to answer.    I tried to call the reservation team number that had called me earlier but it wasn't publicly accessible “the number you're calling does not exist”, so I called the number in the email signature, then got transferred multiple times in an unceremonious manner the same as earlier, and finally talked to someone at the restaurant.    She showed no empathy for my panicking over the risk to miss the deadline by four or eight days, and coldly informed me that the voucher had been sent after all, which I hadn't been informed of. At that point, I mentioned that I would appreciate if they said they were sorry about the many problems. She ignored it.    Finally I received an email 30 minutes later, from the reservations manager who thought that yesterday was tomorrow, and who—at last!— apologized in due form and offered to check with their IT team about the lost email. She also called me another 30 minutes later, apologizing very politely, yet offering no commercial gesture. I personally consider that a symbolically added £30 to my £610 gift certificate would have made up for the displeasing experience and the stress that could have been avoided. As far as I'm concerned, that was a bit too late to accept their apology anyway, as that last mistake was the straw that broke the camel's back, but hopefully this review will help change their booking process.    In the end, the voucher was sent one day late, which is acceptable, but at the cost of a great deal of stress on my part, which I feel is unacceptable for an establishment of this caliber. I can only hope that the experience of my relative at the restaurant will be exceptional to make up for it, hoping the service will not be as disdainful as some of the people I've had on the phone. I've had the experience of booking with several 3 star Michelin restaurants all over France and while there can always be a few issues or small misunderstandings, I have never been faced with such unapologetic nonchalance, until the late intervention of the reservations manager."

Alain Ducasse,30,Food just not 'wow',"Service is very attentive, surroundings are nice, but this very formal restaurant just didn't deliver on food. In terms of taste to value- I have eaten in many better restaurants. Presentation OK but not as good as Core by Clare Smyth for example"

Alain Ducasse,50,Amazing place,An amazing experience! When entering the restaurant you immediately notice the class of the place as well as the quality of the finishes. The interior is modern playing with white and milky colours somehow reaching beige in some points. The tables are set in the space and well assembled. The service and the maitre are excellent in all situations of the evening. But the most important part is the food. The food is a world for its own. Classic with modern touches. Some experimental dishes as well that not always need to be on point but delineate the handwriting of the local chef.  A wonderful evening and I hope to visit this place soon again.

Alain Ducasse,50,Giving this 5/5 despite there being some things I didn’t like because the food is too good not to,"This place is expensive but worth EVERY penny for a very special occasion in my opinion.  I loved that we were able to have 1 tasting menu and 1 a la carte as most places the table has to have the same thing. I of course went for the tasting menu and I highly recommend it even if some of the things don’t sound like they are to your taste - for example I don’t like wasabi, aubergine or oyster and I was served all three at some point during my seven courses and LOVED every second of it. Our menu was:  1. Scallop with beurre blanc and caviar  2. Mackerel with beetroot and wasabi  3. Lobster medallion with chicken quenelle, perigold truffle and semonlina pasta  4. Turbot with blackcurrant and hazelnut  5. Veal with oyster and aubergine  6. Cheese selection  7. Vassout Pear  As if this wasn’t enough food, there were multiple extras and amuse bouches plus lots of bread which was simply a delight! All the staff are great but there were three in particular who were very memorable and felt went above and beyond. Stupidly we didn’t get their names but one was the a young-ish man who served us each course (he has an English bull terrier dog if that helps) one was the gentleman who explained the menu and one was a lovely lady who was just generally around to answer queries.  The few things I didn’t like were firstly we arrived at 6pm for dinner and the doors were locked so we were standing outside with other people in this little doorway outside China tang like we were waiting for a rollercoaster or a cinema, it didn’t feel very sophisticated given the nature of the establishment. Secondly, one of the groups we were standing with were wearing trainers, T-shirts and jogging bottoms and initially they were denied entry. However, they claimed they visited yesterday in similar attire and the staff at the door said they would check with management. 5 mins after we were seated we saw them all enter the restaurant and take their seat. If you have dress code rules that we’ve all got to adhere to then so should they. It felt very much like they were allowed in as they had a lot of money to spend (don’t we all, we are after all at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester.) The third thing I didn’t like which is short term is the the toilets are a mile away from the actual restaurant. A member of staff takes you through China Tang and across to the main ballroom toilets and waits for you as you’d get lost otherwise. She did kindly explain that they are using the ballroom toilets due to hotel renovations which is how I knew it was short term but still annoying to have to go outside and back inside just to go for a wee. The toilets are lovely I will say that! Would I recommend here as a 3 star Michelin restaurant choice, absolutely. This far exceeds the other 3 Michelin star place I’ve been to (which I won’t name.) I would also be intrigued to visit the Dorchester again for China Tang or the Grill as I’ve heard good things about them too."

Alain Ducasse,30,Disappointed,"Firstly the surroundings are a little imposing , as we were the first there , I found that the staff were constantly watching us and it made me feel a little uncomfortable and intimidated. The staff were excellent and attentive and indeed could not fault in anyway . We enjoyed the taster menu .. however I was disappointed with at least 3 of the courses. Several dishes were just too complex with flavours , example was the beetroot dish which in my mind was just a watery bowl of beetroot broth . One of the dishes had Greek yogurt in it and this was all I could taste..way too overpowering. Wines very expensive as was the Port and Cognac . We left feeling underwhelmed and void of any real food experience. To say I woke up this morning disappointed is an understatement . This was the highlight of our trip to London and it just left me feeling very deflated, never mind £1000 out of pocket . I would not go back and I’m afraid I could not recommend this restaurant to others. There are much much better restaurants in London and much cheaper . La Gavouroch by Michelle Roux is much much better . Sorry but this was a let down and by quite a bit ."

Alain Ducasse,30,OK but not upt to 3 Star standard - disappointed.,"We had the 7 course tasting menu. Impeccable service - friendly staff. Dining room is very smart but in my view quite masculine and dark with not a lot of really nice stylish elements... I know it cost a bomb to redo but no to my taste. (Except the table lamps were beautiful). Of the 7 dishes, 2 were excellent - the cucumber/raw sea bass and the lobster (signature dish). The rest were a bit ""ho-hum"" and the turbot dish was disliked by all 4 of us. Comparing ths to other UK 3 stars - eg Core, Waterside, Fat Duck - it is not in the same league. 2 star maybe and at a commensurately lower price."

Alain Ducasse,50,Birthday Treat,"As a birthday treat, it doesn't get more opulent than the Dorchester, a first dining experience in a 3 michelin stared restaurant and it did not disappoint.  The service from the moment we stepped over the threshold was outstanding. Very attentive staff but also finely balanced with a element of discretion.  Boris and Danielle did a fabulous job of looking after us, explaining each dish and wine pairing eloquently and with passion.  The food was delicious, going for the 7 course tasting menu. I was surprised to see 3 out of the 7 courses being either fish or shellfish and only 1 meat dish. As a fish lover this had no consequence to our choice but think for others it may deter people from choosing the amazing menu.  One slight grumble was the renovation work meant going to the toilets meant walking out of the restaurant, outside and into the adjacent door, going down and up so stairs and round lots of corridors. I needed a breadcrumb trail to find my way back. This is only temporary but people with limiting mobility may struggle.  Each dish was as good if not better than the last, the courgette starter and Lobster courses being outstanding. A beautifully discreet birthday dessert was also presented, I request no candles and a sign of respect for the passing of our queen earlier in the day, and the request was followed through.  Overall a wonderful dining experience, thank you to everyone that made us feel special and welcome."

Alain Ducasse,50,Pure Class,"We ate at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester on our Honeymoon and it was absolutely incredible. As soon as we arrived, the door was opened for us by two members of staff working in synch. We were shown to our table and talked through the menu by the waiters. The service was incredibly attentive and friendly and we felt relaxed throughout the meal. The food was amongst the best we have ever tried and each course was well balanced and cooked to perfection. We really appreciated the small touches they put together because it was out Honeymoon. Overall, we would definitely recommend a meal at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester and will definitely be returning in the future."

Alain Ducasse,40,Nice Christmas meal,Went for the tasting menu and had a very enjoyable experience. The restaurant has a nice decor and is laid out beautifully with large tables giving a nice view of the whole restaurant. The food was presented nicely and of a really high standard with very knowledge staff. I’ve eaten in many Michelin Star restaurants and whilst the experience was lovely I would say I have had better experiences at other restaurants within London.

Alain Ducasse,50,Exceptional,After experiencing the tasting menu accompanied with the wine experience I don't think I can ever eat out anywhere else ever again with a modicum of enjoyment compared to this meal.

Alain Ducasse,50,Very special dinner,"It was our first visit to Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester. We came from Bristol to London to celebrate my fiancé’s special birthday. The food was amazing. The combination of taste, texture of different ingredients and presentation were wonderful. The restaurant’s staff went above and beyond to make our dinner very special. The restaurant manager, Laura, Riccardo and other Italian waiter with a Greek name were wonderfully friendly and attentive to us. As a special treat to my fiancé we had an honour to meet a head chef Jean-Philippe Blondet and see his team. It was a very special moment. We look forward to having an occasion to dine again at Alain Ducasse with our whole family."

Alain Ducasse,20,Disappointing,"We have eaten lunch and dinner here several times over the years and always enjoyed a superb meal, but this time it was not worth 1 Michelin star never mind 3. The courgette starter was dull and the teaspoon of caviar stirred into it a waste of caviar. When asked, I told it as it was and was offered the asparagus starter which was a kind thought but I wouldn’t have been able to eat the rest of my dinner. I should have accepted as the lamb main had an unacceptable amount of fat and gristle which left a rather meagre helping of edible meat. The chocolate pudding served in 2 parts was delicious. The lobster starter had to go back as it wasn’t adequately cooked, it had a gelatinous texture. Came back perfectly cooked but the dish as a whole was only “ok” according to my husband, which is particularly disappointing as I ate that dish on our previous visit and it was sublime. The John Dory main was good. At the prices charged every mouthful should be perfect. Even the canapés were dull. Yummy petite fours though and we took what we didn’t eat home."

Alain Ducasse,20,Disappointing Gastronomic Experience,Been here before 7 yrs ago when I got engaged. Decided to repeat the experience for my 40th Birthday. Previously had an extensive menu but now only 7 dishes (which you can have either have as starter/main/desert or 7 course tasting menu).  Offered a glass of complementary Champagne as they were aware it was my birthday (my wife said it was lovely but all alcohol wasted on me as I don't really drink) which was nice of them. We opted for tasting menu. Waiting staff not coordinated and nearly walking into each other. Other waiting staff appeared to be lost walking around the restaurant carrying trays full of food. One of the waitresses has a particularly nasty habit or cracking her fingers and other joints whilst walking around and even when serving at the table. Some of the waiting staff obviously despise each other (as per body language) and would rather be elsewhere.  Food was nice but not deserving of 3 stars (wonder what the criteria is these days for 3 stars) as our lobster was just warm with tepid chicken quenelles. Other dishes were so-so. Food should be perfect as only 7 dishes to deal with. Drinks obviously 3-4+ times mark up on off-license prices (those that can be bought at offy).  Will go out for a steak next time.

Alain Ducasse,50,Truly Wonderful,"A fantastic experience from start to finish. Some friends and I had the 7 course tasting menu with the paring wines . Fantastic food an£ service, truly a wonderful evening"

Alain Ducasse,10,AVOID AVOID!!,Birthday celebration ruined! Staff were professional albeit too fast and production-line style. Food was meagre and fluffed up to sound huge when it was tiny and not great tasting. Wines overpriced and again small amounts despite charging up to £500 extra per person for the pairing. We had to hunt around the tiny mains sauces to find the lamb chop which was even smaller than a 50p coin. Bread was given out sparingly and we had to ask for more - small slice by slice portions. They had extensive works going on and we could not enter at the main door but walk all round the corner in our formal outfits. One couldn't even access the tiny ballroom toilets without being escorted a long way to avoid the dusty works. Definitely over-hyped place - I don't know how they get 5 stars; makes me suspicious! Also it was my birthday and I was astonished to see the very tiny dessert course which everyone was given but mine had a small candle on it! And the well-advertised chef's tour for birthdays never materialised. Thanks for a wonderful birthday celebration -NOT!!

Alain Ducasse,50,Absolutely stunning,"Arrived at agreed time to be greeted by an extremely friendly girl on reception, coats taken and shown to our table from there on in everything was faultless from knowledge by the waiters on every course from where every ingredient was sourced to the cooking process and story behind each dish. We had the 7 course taster menu and every single dish was superb, star of the show being the rack of lamb and the lobster raviolis . We had a bottle of lovely 2014 Barolo which was superb. We would highly recommend a visit as we were very very impressed indeed. Good job Alain ducasse at the dorchester"

Alain Ducasse,50,Wonderful subtle flavours,Went for the 7 course taster. Delicious but subtle flavours. Something for the connoisseur. For me the best course was the John Dory fish but the lobster was good as well. Had the middle grade flight of wine which was beautifully balanced with each dish and they allowed one glass between two.  Very attentive staff who were very knowledgeable and friendly.  A nice touch was that we were taken to the kitchen to meet the head chef Jean-Phillipe Blondet who was very friendly.

Alain Ducasse,50,Worth a trip to London anytime !,"The Dorchester entrance is a time machine as you enter you feel you’re in a different age, the corridors the decoration and art on the walls is just from another century quite eye catching. Then you enter the restaurant which is a mixture in between that and modernity so well designed and paired. You need food to be up to all that luxury and the Chefs do not disappoint the food is fantastic. Then you have a ballet in the service directed by Enrico is just incredible how they managed to master their craft and execute an impecable service with a full restaurant."

Alain Ducasse,50,"the man, the myth, the place to dine","the worlds greatest chef, our favourite uk place to dine, service impecable, food first rate, selection of wines breathtaking first class in every sense, but need to get the set lunch menu back on ???? its amazing value, which we had once, but usually dinner we take"

Alain Ducasse,50,Late birthday celebration,I was treated to the exceptional and totally delicious Jardin menu with each course a very beautiful and totally delicious wonder that kept raising the quality and brought delight to my taste buds.  The staff were excellent being attentive and providing information on the food and much much more.  I am so happy and impressed with everything this restaurant has to offer - I was even invited to meet the chef! A real pleasure….thank you so much 😊

Alain Ducasse,50,Wow,"Our third visit in London but not for some time and definitely not the last, and not just in UK. Faultless food and experience. We had the tasting menu but a special note goes to our wine waiter with whom we exchanged some interesting notes throughout the meal."

Alain Ducasse,50,One of our best meals in London!,"My fiance took me here for my birthday and we had the lunch menu and we both had a really nice experience. The service was excellent to begin with. We told them we do not take alcohol and they were very acccomodating and informed us which dishes are suitable for our diet. They also replaced the wines with Non-alcoholic tea juices.    We had the flower garden, coco bean soup for starters and I had the pollock and my fiance had the duck breast for mains. Amuse bouche was delicious, our 3 courses were of decent size and when dessert came we were both so full up we were trying so hard to finish our dessert. Oops I forgot to mention I think we had a lot of bread before that as the bread and butter was delicious!    For 3 course for £70, it was definitely worth it. I'm not sure if the restaurant still does this lunch menu but if they do it's definitely a must try!"

Alain Ducasse,40,"Delicious food with an extensive menu, not so keen on the service","Extensive menu including an a la carte option with variety of flavours and textures. Food is easily the best thing about this restaurant and is worth the money. The meals are cleverly put together and the entire menu is an experience.    The decor and overall atmosphere is more relaxed than I expected which is refreshing. Its a very calm place to eat and you're given space and time to enjoy your meal.    The only thing that let this place down was the service. I don't know if the restaurant was just short-staffed on the day I attended, but it felt like everyone was rushed off their feet. I really wanted to learn more about the dishes but the staff were very eager to leave once they had presented each dish, looking around while they were talking to you and rushing away before you could say anything. Everyone was running around and you could tell that you were holding them up by asking questions which made me reluctant to engage more with the menu and dishes (isn't that part of the entire 'fine dining experience'?). I ended up leaving early because I just felt I wasn't getting much aside from a nice meal and felt I was getting in the way.    Judging by the rest of the reviews this does just seem to be a one-off experience and I'm looking forward to returning in the near future to hopefully a more pleasant meal. Despite this, I would recommend this restaurant for those interested in a unique culinary experience."

Alain Ducasse,50,Seasons in the Sun as the song goes,"Not been since December I believe. Many changes on the floor with an excellent new RM, truly excellent. The staff is smiling, and genuinely so, not faking it which is so important in a restaurant. We all have our pbs, especially nowadays and a smile may not change the world but a nice evening. En cuisine, also big changes, took a long menu, much more refined than before, over the years, excellent sauces, jus, cuissons, highly refined would be my world. Nice visuals. One suggestion, know it costs but each dish would be so much more nicely presented with a sous-assiette. It changes everything imo. The less is more is so 1990's... Obviously, not everything I agree with but that's my taste like a brioche there, a bouillon, the choice of a fish (when I taste a dish, I try to taste the ingredients separately and then together when possible). Here they respect the seasons for the vegetables, the fish (there is a book that all chefs should have on their shelf and know by heart: Les saisons de l'océan de Christopher Coutanceau ). You think all 3* or even 2* restaurants do that and respect seasons and sustainability? Well i had a pea puree a few weeks ago in a 2* for ex.... And when you have game all year long in a 3* restaurant , even if it is d'elevage? No! Seasons were invented so we can appreciate the season's products AT THEIR BEST not when they are AVAILABLE. It is not because you can get it, source it from a supplier anywhere in the world, that you should serve it. We can all get cherries in December in London. Is that the right thing to do? There is a dish with a mini souffle -would have sworn double cuisson but it is not, a little bit like a la Suissesse/Gavroche) with yellow wine and truffles. A killing we say in French. I can imagine one day they will serve a real souffle, light and elegant like a small isolated cloud in a summer sky with hints of yellow wine, truffles, and aged Comte..... But maybe they don't know how to do it...? :)! They probably don't...! :) That would be a classic 3* dish imo. Yesterday was maybe one of the best meals I had in this restaurant. At the moment, this team in the kitchen and on the floor is at its best. Let's hope they don't lose focus. The hotel is under restoration, there is a corridor to go to the men's room. A suggestion: a few decorative print sets hanging on the curtains would make it less ""chantier-like"". Just an idea. The wine list is on the expensive and difficult side. My own choice of wine yesterday was not great. My fault but the wine list is the weak point of this restaurant."

Alain Ducasse,50,Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester still Towers over London,"Recently, upon visiting my son, a student at Imperial College, I chose to delight him at Alain Ducasse. We were not disappointed. HIGHLIGHTS: both ordering the tasting menu, the Jerusalem artichokes with Kristal caviar cream simply melted in your mouth; the lobster medallion, chicken quenelles and Périgord truffle with semolina pasta was flavorful and nicely balanced; turbot, salsify, razor clams and black garlic, parsley, ripe tomatoes, and citrus was delicious, subtlety sour and sweet, allowing the flavor of the turbot to ascend; ending with a fabulous pineapple, galanga sorbet, the latter of which mostly found in Thai cuisine – citrusy with hints of pine. The BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT, however, was being invited into the kitchen to meet Executive Chef Jean-Philippe Blondet himself, who was incredibly gracious. Service was world-class with kudos to Mattia Marcelli and his superb staff. No doubt we'll be back."

Alain Ducasse,10,Birthday dinner,"This restaurant is rated very high as it has 3 Michelin Stars.  Unfortunately I found it very disappointing the food was so average, I expected flavours to burst in your mouth in fact it was the opposite. I wouldn’t recommend this restaurant to anyone. The bill was 1,500. We were 4 people.  Spend your money anywhere but here.  Jackie"

Alain Ducasse,50,Exceptional,Service was mind blowing.great food and wine narratives from all staff ..staff mostly Italian .great balance between attentiveness v interference..pricing on the taster menu s was earth shattering but worth it.the renovations around the hotel made access a bit long winded but the overall expert exceeded our expectations

Alain Ducasse,50,3 Michelin stars at its best.,"From the minute we entered we were met with world class service, we all chose the tasting menu and it did not disappoint, everything was excellent. My personal favourite was the cauliflower soufflé but the Lobster was up there as was the beef. The wine tasting is also a must if you enjoy wine, there is a choice if three different pairings with the first at £100, second £210 and £500. We had the second which again was as good as the food it was paired with."

Alain Ducasse,50,Exceptional evening celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary.,"What I can say, what an evening. We both had the 7 course taster menu.    Every course served just got better and better as the evening progressed. The waiters knowledge of the food and its provenance was incredibly impressed.    The Sommelier knowledge of the wines was amazing and to have an opportunity to visit Jean Phillipe Blondel in the kitchen made our evening.    For me/us a once in a life time experience made memorable by every member of staff in the restaurant.    Absolutely stunning evening, thoroughly recommended, well done guys 🥂👏👏👏👏"

Alouette,50,Happy Hour 😊,"Met sone colleagues for Happy Hour and our server, Wanita, was lovely. Suggested the Duck Poutine and would 💯recommend. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming."

Alouette,50,Excellent French bistro who nailed the classic fare: especially the côte de boeuf and bouillabaisse,"Excellent French bistro who nailed the classic fare: especially the côte de boeuf and bouillabaisse.    Food: 5 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 4.5  Cost to worth it rating: 3  Opentableable: no, but Seven Rooms  Return worthiness: yes  Eve award: best côte de boeuf and bouillabaisse    Highlights:  - Côte de boeuf: large format steak with thick cuts of tasty beef perfectly cooked to a medium rare. My husband and 12 year old son share big steaks often and are pretty tough critics and they were very happy. It comes with 2 orders of fries, 2 large pieces of bone marrow, bread, and 3 sauces. Legit. 5 stars  - Bouillabaisse: so much variety of seafood. It included halibut, shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, and crab legs. Pretty much the French version of SF cioppino and I loved the savory broth which was not as tomato-y. Surprisingly there was something about these small potato cubes which were extra delightful and stood out. I couldn't get enough of it. Served with toasted bread to sop up the juices. Amazing. 5 stars  - Fries: thin version served in cones. Perfectly crunchy outside and tender inside. Perfect. My son's only complaint was some were too short and extra crunchy but I loved those too. 5 stars  - French onion soup: cheesy oniony goodness. 4 stars  - Creme brule: classic version. 4 stars  - Wines: selection of many French wines to pick from  - Waiter: hustling to serve everyone upstairs  - Nice space with a downstairs dining room, and upstairs area overlooking the main room, and a few tables outside. Our table was one of the ones with the comfy chairs which my son loves (he's also a seating critic). ;-)    Midlights:  - Dim lighting upstairs so we needed a lamp to see the menu and our food.    Lowlights:  - Didn't have room for escargot to start or seared foie added to the steak course which I would have loved to enjoy.  - Duck poutine on the happy hour menu, but not available for dinner. Would also have loved to try that and tried to make it back for a HH one day, but didn't get to.    Interestingly enough, it's the same restaurant group as Hydra. at the time of writing this Hydra is #1 on Trip Advisor and Alouette #2. We enjoyed both on our weekend but had more mid/lowlights at Hydra, so my vote would be for this restaurant."

Alouette,50,Wonderful Breakfasts,"I ate breakfast here everyday during my stay at Le Soleil and it was always amazing, the food was beyond good and the staff were friendly and patient with a not terribly awake traveller. Especially recommend the Breakfast Cassoulet."

Alouette,50,Birthday dinner experience!,We had a great experience to celebrate birthday! Anita was excellent with her service and recommendations and the food was top notch!

Alouette,50,Fab dinner,"Beautiful dinner. The food portion was big, ambience was spot in, service was good. Thank youvGuillome!"

Alouette,50,Beautiful vibe & great happy hour,Awesome happy hour! Lovely French wine for $6 a glass and mussels… can’t be beat! And the ambience was spectacular. Will definitely be back for a dinner as well.

Alouette,20,disappointed,"Came for a dinner date and left severely disappointed. I could have forgiven the little mistakes (the foie Gras was over cooked, the crostini’s served with it were also over cooked and much to thick to enjoy, the toast with the tartar was served cold etc) but it was the main course that ruined it, I had the lamb ordered med rare and my partner has the steak rare. Both of our meats were blue rare and cold in the middle, when we complained they offered to reheat it, which they did by chucking it all in a pan angrily and reheating it while letting the sides and sauces get cold. The meat came back over cooked and the sides were ice cold. It was a very expensive dinner, with a nice bottle of wine and I feel truly ripped off by the whole experience."

Alouette,50,Incredible happy hour,"We had an incredible late lunch/ early dinner during happy hour. The happy hour drinks and wine are fantastic and shouldn’t be missed. The French onion soup, poutine, salad Niçoise , and shrimp Provençal were excellent. I think the escargot can be skipped I think- it needs more garlic! Our service was excellent- from the host to the support staff. Guillaume was such a treat gave us wonderful recommendations. We’d definitely visit again!"

Alouette,50,Fabulous 5 star HAPPY HOUR!!,"Fabulous 5 star HAPPY HOUR!!  Great vibe, beautiful surroundings, yummy food, a warm & welcoming server, named Wanita!  We will return soon!  Thank you for a lovely experience!  Kevin & R"

Alouette,50,Great Happy Hour Spot,"It was my first time at the restaurant, my friend and I came for happy hour. We ordered the shrimp provencal, shrimp cocktail, and a moules and frites to share, along with drinks. Everything was delicious and generous portions, my favourite was the shrimp provencal. We ended the meal with the profiteroles to share and it was delicious! Definitely not your average profiterole, had a lot of different textures and elements that made it amazing. Our server Wanita was also very kind and attentive! The ambience of the restaurant was very nice, can't wait to come back for dinner."

Alouette,50,Great place to celebrate a special anniversary!,"Outstanding dining- excellent service, exquisite food, great atmosphere! Greatly enjoyed and highly recommended."

Alouette,50,Alouette Alouette!! A great place to dine out in Vancouver!!,"Our dining experience at Alouette was fantastic! The atmosphere, the decor, the location and especially the amazing food made it a great place to dine out in Vancouver!  Thank you so much to our gentle and amiable server Wanita for making our dining experience at Allouette a memorable one!"

Alouette,50,Exceptional service,"Great place for dinner and drinks. They have plenty of room for large parties and 2 patio seatings. It’s not too loud and the ambience is very welcoming. Guillame, our server, was exceptional - personable and genuinely attentive"

Alouette,50,Excellent.,"Wonderful restaurant with a lot of energy and deliciously prepared foods.  My wife and I had a reservation and showed up 30 minutes early. They were busy, but extremely accommodating; we were seated in five minutes. As the night progressed, we could see many people who didn’t have reservations waiting at least 30 minutes to be seated. It is deservedly a popular place.  It is a young, very friendly staff and our server was engaging and accommodating. The dining room is eye catching with a large modern, unique overhead light fixture that captures the spirit of this location; free formed, flowing and whimsical.  Each round of our dinner starting with the appetizers (I enjoyed an incredible French onion soup - bold and layered with subtle flavors) and ending with dessert was delicious. The profiterole was as authentic as anyone could imagine. It topped off a great meal.  If this restaurant were located in a town close to where my wife and I live, I know we would be regular patrons."

Alouette,50,A delightful and memorable dining experience.,"Alouette has been our favorite French restaurant in Vancouver for years. Last Thursday Wanita took care of us by helping us to chose the right dishes, including the ones for my partner Sharon who is a vegan. Wanita also recommended a nice red California wine. We all enjoyed the food immensely, the lovely wine and above everything else Wanita's professionalism, kindness and dedication. We will certainly go back to Alouette as soon as we are back in Vancouver.  Bill for Sharon and Paul."

Alouette,50,Very Cool Spot,loved this spot very romantic and parisian style food was fair drinks excellent service superb try the fries on happy hour menu

Asiate,50,"Impeccable service , excellent martini","We had a relaxing drink here and were lucky to get jimmy as our server . Attentive service , friendly , and perfectly done drinks . Very generous portions . All excellent"

Asiate,50,great food and service,"The food is very good and the setting is beautiful but what makes it stand out is the really lovely attentive service, kind and helpful without being obtrusive. We had a blast here."

Asiate,40,Good service and nice food,It’s a nice restaurant and the service is excellent. The food is nice but I really wish that they would change the menu every now and again.

Asiate,30,Average at best and not worth the price.,"Had both breakfast and lunch here. Really felt the prices were outrageous for the portions. Especially the breakfast …four sausages on a plate, 4 pieces of bacon on another. Warm bread (supposed to be toast) on another. No ambiance. Disappointingly average."

Asiate,50,Clément at Peninsula- NYC,Amazing experience! Went there to celebrate our birthdays. Love the ambience. Crab cake - the best I ever had . The lamb dish was cooked to perfection. The soufflé and sorbet: so yummy. Service: the best . I can’t wait to go back.

Asiate,50,Happy Brunch,"Great spot on 5th Ave. Good food, good menu, Super friendly staffs. Attentive and attention to details. Comfy setting."

Asiate,50,Wonderful Thanksgiving dinner,"Highly recommend Clement for dinner. We went as a family for Thanksgiving dinner and it was wonderful. Delicious food, great atmosphere, with professional and friendly hosts. Will return."

Asiate,50,Great stylish venue for breakfast. Excellent service and food. A good way to start the day.,We chose to have breakfast at the Clement restaurant. Stylish decor with ample space to be separated from other diners. The service was exactly as you would expect it to be.  Professional and efficient. The menu offered a good selection. Prices were as you would expect in an establishment of this standard.  Six of us were dining and we all enjoyed the food we selected.  An enjoyable dining experience and a great way to start the day.

Asiate,50,A pleasant luch,"We visited the Peninsula hotel, aiming for a cocktail at the roof top terrace. However, we ended at Clement restaurant for late lunch. We were a bit hesitant, once we saw the menu, but it was a very pleasant surprise! The service was excellent and the food delicious."

Asiate,40,Business dinner,Very nice ambiance in this hotel restaurant. Service was excellent. The appetizers they circulated were very good. I had the salmon was tasty.

Asiate,40,Perfect Breakfast,The food was wonderful. Nice selection. Expensive but worth it. Quiet atmosphere perfect for conversation. The waiter was very patient as we stayed 3 hours!

Asiate,50,Wonderful Breakfast,"Breakfast of any kind at 6:30 in the morning is always a challenge in the area. Finding a venue which allows you time and tranquility as you plan your day is truly a find. Such is Clement. Warm, genuinely friendly and accommodating wait staff and a laid-back atmosphere on my Saturday morning visit.  And, as you would expect, food offerings to match."

Asiate,20,"Rude servers, very uninviting","My husband and I visited this bar last month while vacationing in NYC. The waiters were very unwelcoming from the beginning, and acted like it was a bother to have customers. We went during the afternoon, when there were only two other tables of guests dining. Once seated, they kept asking if we were ready to order before even allowing us time to look at the menu. We had looked at the menu online prior to coming to the bar and specifically wanted a couple of the appetizer dishes it showed. The menu in the bar was different, so we asked the waiter if the dished from the online menu were available. He scoffed at us and said no, then walked away. Our entire experience here was negative, and we felt as though the waiters were very rude and short with us, and acted like it was an inconvenience to serve our table. I would advise management to keep a closer eye on your employees and the way they treat guests. We will not be coming back."

Asiate,50,"Friendly, welcoming and grand…. Restaurant Week special !!","This classic establishment is located in the upper level of the Forbes Five Star-rated Peninsula NY Hotel lobby, in Mid-town, NYC ~ just walk on up ..and they’re there to welcome you as an honored guest (since 2013) and do the whatever to please you ~~ and for a price, of course !    Wedding Anniversary dinner… they asked when we made the reservation a few weeks earlier, if this was a special occasion, and made a note to do a little special thing for us at the end of the meal …VERY NICE !! and Thank you, all !!!    So, on a hot July evening, enter through the hotel lobby and escape the realities of the times in America. The large space offers views of the street and also 5th Avenue below through enormous arched windows, and private nooks for a more private experience on the other. The décor is luxuriant and very pleasant: each room has its own unique style and décor, with low lighting, parquet flooring, carpets, long drapes, luxurious wallpapers, art deco panels and soft furnishings that keep the atmosphere a subdued but grand calm, almost like being in a private home. The sublime ambiance allows one to fully experience one’s evening in luxury and comfort, without being drowned out by the neighboring tables.    Price are in the low- to mid-stratosphere: appetizers are $16 to $23 and mains are $24 to $65, while the sides are $12 (all..) ! Desserts ? - $15. And drinks ? Fuhggeddaboudit !! Not the everyday dinner, but the preparations here are possibly worth the price. Clement also offers several pairings and set combinations, which are best left to be explored another time. We were there for a celebration, (..they asked) and were gracious enough to give us a complementary small sweet and cheese plate to mark the occasion. Thank you !!    So, it was a pleasant evening: long drive to the City in the Saturday evening traffic, a struggle to find parking nearby, and then a fine dinner followed by another struggle to find where we left the car, and a long drive back to the ‘burbs. But tomorrow’s a sleep-in day….    The lobster bisque is really incredible: very lobstery and smooth, with chunks of meat, in a deep, creamy broth. And crispy octopus is a treat when well cooked, as this was: crispy edges and tender, succulent inners, with a hint of lemony-sea. For mains: Dover Sole and Rack of Lamb.. both excellent, and a fair portion per serving. Soft and easy cut on the knife, and an easy bite. Not overcooked ~ or under, as then lamb can be gamy. The portion size in both was just enough, so one isn’t stuffed or hungry after ~ and they aren’t pushing a second order afterwards.    Well worth the visit."

Asiate,40,Whether in the bar or the dining room - can't go wrong.,"At lunch we like the bar. Very nice cheese board and sliders. For dinner the dining room will please you. It is a lovely, more formal atmosphere than the bar. Both are great."

Asiate,50,55th st teavel,"I started king cole bar, bloody Mary's , , to Clement for dinner, then to Connerly Irish bar. Dinner at clement was excellent. Many thanks."

Asiate,50,Spectacular,"The dinner here is something special. Set in a beautiful hotel on 5th Avenue with soothing calm decor. The meals we experienced were ink infused pasta seafood, ceviche, and lamb. I just don't know how it could have been any better. If you are lucky enough to get Marco as your server, you have reached the pinnacle. Make this your special place or a special treat. Life is too short not to experience this!"

Asiate,50,Quite Wonderful,"First of all, this restaurant is quiet and has a soothing decor. It is possible to have a conversation without screaming and there is no stupid music playing in the background.  my wife and I also enjoyed our starters and entrees very much. My main course consisted of black squid ink pasta with seafood.Delicious!,,,but maybe not for everyone. there are certainly many more conventional dishes to choose from.  Service was smooth, friendly and unobtrusive,  I thought that it was all just great!"

Asiate,30,The hostess ruined the experience,"I took me parents to Clement on Friday Night for dinner. We were 15 mins early, and waited until the restaurant opened. We were the second group to arrive, and the hostess took us to a table in the middle of the dining area. We asked if we could sit right next to the window as there are more than 10 tables right next to the window. She said no, those are tables for 2 guests. We saw there are two tables for 3 right next table, she said those are reserved. I said I made a reservation too. She was like but those are VIPs. We saw one table had a reserved sign on it, but the other one did not, and asked if that was also reserved. She paused and said, yes, somebody just called and told her she wanted that table. I knew she lied to me on the spot but at that moment I did not want to ask anymore. I simply took what she said as “truth” and translated to my parents to prevent them getting upset. A few minutes later, she took another guest in and told her she could choose any table she likes, either the one right next to the window (which she claimed someone called to reserve) or another one at the back).    I had no complaint about the table we ended up sitting at, it was still a very good spot. Also, I would like to say there’s no bad seating overall. It’s just this one time I would like to treat my parents, and gave them a good experience. We simply politely asked if we could sit at a table when almost the entire restaurant was vacant, and there was no sign on the table. But the hostess just have to tell us that we are secondary guest, no matter if there’s a VIP reservation or not. She did not even tried to show a little bit effort to accommodate, but just no, or no after made-up excuses. The high standard of hospitality and excellence of service which the Peninsula brand carries just got lost from the way she treated us. Or she just learned to classify guests, and decided who would get better service. Hopefully she would get more training.    Luckily, the food and service were fabulous. The gentleman who served our table did not know, but his service and hospitality were beyond awesome, and I almost forgot the unpleasant experience. When we left the restaurant, we passed by the hostess who had a stone cold face on, which reminded me how we started the experience.    It would be a 5 star night if the hostess could handle the situation a little bit better, or at least don’t tell us in face that we are secondary guests. I did want to talk to the manager, but was afraid that my parents would notice and realized what happened. I’m glad they still enjoyed the whole experience, thanks to our wonderful waiter and delicate & delicious food."

Asiate,40,Great place to eat!,Veery relaxed environment. Good choice of food on the menu and the food is delicious. Would recommend anyone to visit there!.

Asiate,50,Our Fave!,"We had a wonderful Sunday brunch at our fave restaurant in the city! Everything on the menu is delicious and the service is unmatched. You never have to wait for a table, and the service is fast, but you never feel rushed. Best of the best in the city and definitely worth the price!"

Asiate,40,Dinner or breakfast you can’t go wrong.,"Dinner was amazing. Staff very profesional. We arrived 10 minutes before they opened instead of turning us away they sat us and took our drink order. It’s the small details that make a difference. They knew we were there pre theater and they got us out in a timely manner. Even treated us to dessert. We enjoyed our time so much we visited for breakfast. We were seated promptly. In the mornings you have all walks of life - suits, along with families and couples. The staff is very attentive. The food is delicious whether dinner or lunch you won’t be disappointed."

Asiate,50,Amazing breakfast,What a wonderful way to start the day - beautiful restaurant- good was delicious - omelet and blueberry pancakes - our waiter Argim was one of the best - exceptional service so nice - one of the best hotel breakfasts we have had highly recommend

Asiate,50,Best Breakfast!,We enjoyed the breakfast at Clement so much that we ate there twice during our trip to NYC. The avacado toast (available upon request) is to die for!! Fresh squeezed juices are wonderful. Many healthy and vegetarian options are available. Highly recommend!

Asiate,50,Excellent food AND service,"Incredible service, modifying plates, creating plates for this vegan. Knowledgeable and personable service (ask for Marco) simply delicious plates. Attentive but not intrusive, explanatory but not over the top, elite but not stuffy - been there 3 times in the past 3 months."

Asiate,50,Great experience,We went to Clement for lunch on a Monday. The service was attentive and professional as expected from such high-end restaurant. The food was very tasty and the different flavour combinations complimented each other quite nicely.

Asiate,50,Excellent food,One of the best duck breasts I have ever eaten. Service was slightly over soliciting but it was compensated by the fact that the waiter kept refilling our wine glasses when we only ordered a glass.. Great ambience

Atelier,50,Wow!,Wow! Excellent dishes with many surprises. I suggest reserving early to be the first one to be served to keep the surprise and also since the meal is fairly long.

Atelier,10,Everything has gone way down including our satisfaction of feedbacks.,"I use to bring my friends and celebrate birthdays at atelier. I moved away and still tried to return. However the quality of food has gone way down. Also instead of individual dishes, it has gone family style with a bunch of tapas style. Food was either too salty or too sweet and nothing complimented each dish anymore. There was not even sufficient palate cleanser between meals. Wines were not paired well for each course and I trusted my credit card was well adjusted so I told them to put the tap on my visa however they just racked it up to over 800 when the prix fix meals were only supposed to be 220 per person. I emailed and they didn’t care if I never came back. I never expected one of the restaurants I recommended to a lot of my friends be like that. I’ll go over to hulls casino for gastro style food now. Every month I come back to Ottawa now for meetings, definitely no longer going to bring my guests to atelier ever again."

Atelier,40,An extraordinary experience with some flaws,"I took my wife to this restaurant for her birthday. This was not our first time at Atelier, as we had dined there previously several years ago and before the pandemic. That said, this was our first time experiencing the new 42 course tasting menu.    Firstly, as a matter of disclosure, I am not a lover of tasting menus and was dreading a little the four-hour marathon experience. Even my wife, who typically enjoys tasting menus, was having some second-thoughts about choosing this restaurant for her birthday given the time commitment and our overall sleep deprivation due to our baby son's early morning wakeups. We were legitimately concerned that we both would be going face down in our desserts by the fourth hour.    However, we were nevertheless looking forward to the unique menu and food which we knew would be spectacular from past experience.    As before, the restaurant is minimalist, to put it mildly. The decor is like something you'd expect from a cafeteria, rather than a fine-dining venue. While I realize this is part of the chic unpretentious vibe the restaurant is going for, there's a point where the ""less is more"" philosophy simply becomes *less*. I feel that when I dine at a restaurant where my bill for two is north of $600 before tip, some character not to mention a touch of elegance would be expected.    The service was excellent. As soon as we finished our water someone was there to refill. When we finished our wine and cocktails, the waiter was there within minutes to offer a refill. We found the wait staff friendly and engaging.    Most significantly, I noted to the waiter at the outset that I much preferred to eat many dishes at once rather than have each tiny amuse bouche sized dish arrive one at a time. He noted that this was the way the chef would have preferred to serve the 42 course menu originally. I did not ask for nor expect any special consideration; I was simply making conversation with the waiter and expressing an opinion.    To our delight, that's exactly how the food was served - 4-8 dishes at a time. Instead of one tiny amuse bouche followed by a long wait for the next mouthful (which was our experience with the old menu and other tasting menu experiences) food arrived fast and furious in a delightful smorgasbord of dishes. Now this was my idea of a tasting menu!    When the waiter announced that only 12 dishes remained from the 42 course menu and we were moving into the dessert phase, to my surprise it was only a little over two hours into our meal. The waiter confirmed, upon inquiry, that he had done precisely what I had asked and delivered more dishes at once, rather than spreading them out which was the norm. We were absolutely delighted at this unexpected (and unasked for) accommodation, which not only improved the experience immensely but permitted us to finish up after just under three hours, which let us get home at a much more reasonable hour.    Regarding the food, it was outstanding as expected, but if I may make a criticism I feel the balance could have been tweaked, especially on the portion size for the ""main"" dishes. To be frank, I would have wished for more meat on the bone (literally and figuratively) and would have happily sacrificed 9-10 of the amuse bouche portions to get some more of the main dishes such as the braised meat. And that's part of the problem with a 42 course menu - it's just hard to even remember what it is you're eating. Even now, just two days later, it's all a haze in my mind. Everything is excellently prepared by Chef Lepine, but all you're getting are these fleeting little tastes, which can be maddening. I just wanted more of some things and less of others and in the end left feeling a little *unsatisfied*, even if my belly was full. Again, this has always been my main dissatisfaction with tasting menus but I feel it was exacerbated even further by the extraordinary number of dishes (42), which I found overwhelming.    I have awarded Atelier 4 stars rather than 5 in my review for three reasons:    1. The dreary decor;  2. The balance of the menu, especially in the ""mains"";  3. Too many dishes resulting in an unsatisfying, confusing experience.    For the price they are charging, I expect absolute top notch in every respect, and the restaurant falls short in just a few areas. That said, there's no denying that this is an incredible one-of-a-kind experience, especially for a City like Ottawa. When the Michelin Guide comes knocking, I've no doubt Chef Lepine will earn his star."

Atelier,10,Worst dining experience of our lives,"This was the most disappointing meal we've ever experienced. The bottle of red wine came out cold to start (a wine that should be served room temp at least), and it went downhill from there.    Realize this is a 'gastronomic dining experience' but the food was awful. Just terrible. Cold, under seasoned, and some were almost inedible. I was excited when the snow crab came out, only for it to explode in a grease bomb in my mouth and I had to spit it out. The oil tasted like it hadn't been changed in a week. You scan a QR code with each dish and Atelier really needs to check often where these are directed - the foie gras/pate dish when scanned when to a search where the first article was about ducks having tubes shoved down their throats to force feed them to create this delicacy. Not exactly something you want to read about during your elite dining experience! My husband and I were continuously looking around to see if others were enjoying their 'edible paper' or cold tortellini. The one dish we enjoyed (out of 44!) was the pea puree. If you like wine, they have an extensive wine list. The wine was the highlight of our meal, and our server was friendly.    As someone who travels, cooks and dines out often, we had been looking forward to this for months given the good reviews. We left (after a $500+ bill for 2, after a 10% discount due to us expressing our dismay), wishing for our time back to go anywhere else but Atelier. Still in shock anyone would pay to eat here."

Atelier,50,Wow,"Our night at Atelier was like a guided tour of Europe's 2-star Michelines and tasting everything on their menus.    We were served 44 bites of the most delicious and varied food that we've ever tasted, presented in beautiful arrangements, and releasing bursts of wonderful, unexpected flavours. I spend my year trying to find food experiences that does that just once for me, and then I come to Atelier and I get dozens and dozens of that thrill all night.    Above all else, I love delicious, beautifully prepared desserts.  Imagine my unbridled joy when our server delivered 10 of the most fantastic tasting desserts I've ever eaten.     The genius of Atelier is the beautiful execution of so many dishes and the wonderful experience of trying them all. As your night goes on, you get the feeling that you're involved in something magical as each successive dish impresses, and your thoughts are joined with excitement coming from tables all around exclaiming over their own favorite dishes.    Thanks so much to the chefs and staff who made this wonderful food and wine experience possible."

Atelier,50,Deserving of a Michelin star,"Absolutely outstanding, one of the top dining experiences in my life, and I've eaten and cooked at many highly ranked and Michelin starred restaurants. Cameron and Devon were outstanding FOH, and chef was gracious and attentive. He really leans into technology, from the innovations coming from the kitchen, to the use of QR codes and cell phones, which connect you to ingredients, techniques and suppliers. Atelier is clearly ahead of its time!  I need to add a comment regarding the rare poor reviews online. Yes, there are courses delivered as a chip or powder, etc.. The kitchen is challenging us with textures and flavours that chef challenges us to identify, but all work perfectly in the context of the dish. I left completely satisfied (after almost 5 hours!), and couldn't ask for anything more."

Atelier,10,A culinary experience akin to a 42 dish course of partially defrosted airline meals.,"A culinary experience akin to a 42 dish course of partially defrosted airline meals.    A culinary equivalent of a modern art hoax. An installation art from 2015 called, When Are We Going to Dance Tonight? comes to mind.    You will enjoy it if you like:    -Costco's bread crumbs (presented as a dish). You will be asked to guess the flavors.  -Crumbled Doritos (presented as a dish) .  -Crumbled Doritos and Costco's bread crumbs sprinkled over some one or another partially defrosted airplane meal. Its cold because it is ""molecular"", as you must know.  -Like to scan things when you eat them  -Art for art's sake  -Interior design as tasteless as the food  -Uncomfortable chairs that will keep you on he edge of the seat, unable to relax"

Atelier,10,Quantity over quality. Very disappointing.,"I guess for the price I am forced to compare this place with very good European restaurants in Paris or other cities. Its not even close. I guess it was mostly rated by people with different past experiences than mine. Feels very Ottawa-like. Too many chips dishes. Yes. Chips. I don’t expect to get a dish called ‘wasted’ (as explained it is made from ingredients that otherwise would be wasted), i dont expect to get chips (at least 3 dishes, I dont expect to get cheap desserts, just give me one good chocolate soufflé instead). K, if you want to feel foolish at the end of the evening, go for it.    I had the 44 courses dinner.  Like in life, it should be about quality. Not quantity."

Atelier,50,Anniversary dinner,"Our experience here was wonderful. It was our anniversary and they made us feel very special. As soon as we got there they wished us a happy anniversary. The food was amazing and very nicely presented, we had the wine pairing and that is a MUST if you eat here. Our waitress Laura was amazing, and the sommeliers are so knowledgeable about the wine, any question you throw at them they know! You must come here if you’re looking for an experience."

Atelier,50,Amazing!,Atelier recently started offering a “drive through” version of their dinners. Beautifully done! And what a wonderful gesture! That is a very work-intensive project for not much return considering the expense I would imagine. Bravo to them for doing this!

Atelier,50,Awesome Special Anniversary Gift,"This is a very special place to go for a fantastic evening of dining on unique, amazing dishes prepared by the best chef’s! Each plate served was an artwork and very unique! Highly recommended for special occasions!"

Atelier,40,Unbelievable evening out - if your a foodie - just go there!,"This place is unique. Book ahead and get a personal call to verify the reservation and checking on dietary restrictions and anything you don't like. They will customize the menu to make sure you are pleased and don't have any surprises. 12 courses - every evening is totally unique with dishes rotated out and in every day. Big plates little courses - still a lot of food to cram down. We left stuffed.... Eat at your pace - just engage with the staff on timing. We were there for three hours. This leaves lots of time between dishes to talk and relax. There are also wine pairings - one large - - one small - The large option delivers a small glass with virtually every dish. The couple beside us could not keep up. Every dish is amazing - - the food is perfect and the presentation is spectacular and prepared with meticulous detail. The presentation on the plates is like a work of art - Instagramers delight! In particular I liked the Mushroom Tom Yum, Scallop Croquette, Guinea Fowl Liver Mousse, and the Kimchi Rice and Beef. The beef was perfect - - a great cut, tender, juicy, and cooked rare. Melts in your mouth. Pricey night out at $125 pp (all in with tip was $315 for two - without wine pairings). Wine by the glass is also pretty steep. Limited parking on the street. Take Uber. Servers take time to present and describe every dish - this was fun for both of us. Listed as one of the top 100 restaurants in Canada in 2019. It was number 25 in the country."

Atelier,50,Awesome,The food is amazing. It is like artwork. Beautiful to look at. Very different and many dishes are served. The waiter explains all the rare ingredients and how it is prepared. Loved it. Great for a special occasion.

Atelier,50,Perfect for a special occasion,"We have been there three times for milestone birthdays with friends, and enjoyed our experience each time. We especially liked being surprised with the creative presentation and choices. Some dishes are like edible art!"

Atelier,50,Amazing,My daughter took me to celebrate my retirement... we had stellar service from Eric and in addition chose the wine pairing which was also excellent... our somalier was very knowledgeable and we had some great conversations with him... the good news was that we were able to have one wine pairing between us as I don’t drink much... the food was delicious... my favourite course was the sable fish and my daughter’s was the scallops... a wonderful treat which ended with a visit with chef/owner Marc Levine...

Atelier,50,Excellent food,This place has been recommended by friends and we finally managed to book a table this last August for my father's 60th birthday. I loved it! I highly recommend it.

Atelier,50,Excellent Menu & Wine Selection,"This place has been recommended by friends and we finally managed to book a table this last November. Their 12-course tasting menu spells quality, creativity and a sense for the new age cuisine with a focus on taste and mixing of flavors. We're probably not the most fortunate in Ottawa as far as gourmet/ haute-cuisine, but the Atelier is aiming toward that. A place for local foodies and tourists alike. Loved their wine selection and pairing. We'll return soon."

Atelier,50,Atelier didn’t disappoint like so many others in Ottawa. One of the best that Ottawa has to offer!,"Originally hailing from Montreal we have very little expectations from the Ottawa food scene but we were pleasantly surprised! This restaurant lives up to it’s reputation which is hard to find in Ottawa. This quaint little place is every foodies dream. We loved all the meticulously prepared dishes. Thanks to the chef and the server, we will be coming back again."

Atelier,50,Husband's Retirement Meal Happy Days for Us!!!,"Our reservations were for 6:30 and the 12 course dinner went on until 9:30. We also ordered the extended pairing of wines. Some hits some misses with the wines as you can imagine, since we're not very big wine drinkers but you could see how the pairings worked with the food. The twelve course meal was incredible. There were only two that we weren't overly crazy about, but not the chef's fault. More because of our personal likes and dislikes. A very heavy cilantro sauce with the salmon, but it was easy to move it away. The Mushroom Tom Yun was rather mild as well but like everything else, incredibly presented. The Servers and Sommelier were top notch. Trained to the very top of the tops.The one picture we forgot, The Fig and Black Garlic was incredibly intense with lovely lingering flavors. The pictures are named for each course.    It's quite a daunting experience and something I don't think I'd do more than once a year. Not due to expense though. The menu changes slowly over several months, so to experience it's uniqueness, I don't think you'd want to go more often than every six months. I don't think we've ever spend that kind of money on a meal but it was a once in a lifetime treat.    I have only one comment about the salad in the terrarium. The silver chopsticks are too slippery to pick up the food. You need one's that can grip."

Atelier,40,Highly recommended cooking masterclass from Marc Lepine,"We really enjoyed the 12 course Atelier tasting menu, with paired wine.    We had a superb meal and the individual dishes were without exception all superb, clever and tasty. Marc Lepine is a seriously clever and inventive chef.    The only slight downer for us was the service and atmosphere in the restaurant, which is not as polished or interesting as the food. This was fustrating as everything else was on point and lived up to Ateliers massive gastronomic reputation."

Atelier,40,Fantastic food but atmosphere needs work,"My girlfriend and I went to Atelier to celebrate a special occasion. The food was fantastic and the service really was top notch. My issue is that at this price tag and type of experience, you expect a certain atmosphere of comfort/coziness especially if you are sitting there for three hours. The chairs were uncomfortable and the atmosphere was lacking at best. It's a shame that this took away slightly from the fact the the food was phenomenal and unlike anything I have ever tried. I would still recommend"

Atelier,50,Absolutely outstanding gastronomic experience from Chef Marc Lepine. Foodies take note!,"When in Ottawa make a point of dining at Atelier but book well in advance as it is a tiny venue. This is well worth going out of your way for!    Our group had the 12 course tasting menu with one fabulous small course after another. Not one of the courses was weak; indeed each was a visual and flavour experience! Service was outstanding too, and they graciously worked around each of our individual food idiosyncracies.    Two different and well-thought out wine pairings were available as well as bottles and glasses from their excellent wine list.    A highly recommended and truly outstanding dining experience in an out of the way venue in Ottawa."

Atelier,50,Gastronomic Experience,"I had heard many wonderful reviews about Marc Lepine’s famous restaurant, but I had only tried some bites at charity events like Taste of Hope. This evening exceeded my expectations. The 12 course blinded menu is an 5 senses experience. Our server Melissa was friendly, attentive, fun and her timing was perfect. While I am not a wine connoisseur, I recommend splurging on the wine pairing. Sommelier Jenna gave us such insights into the vineyards, varieties and style of winemaking. She is gem and added significantly to our experience. We opted to enjoy the pace and did not take photos of our dishes, and to let the evening unfold. Thank you Marc and team Atelier."

Atelier,40,Tasty food and great presentation,Good location with parking. Great experience and need to be adventurous. Don’t forget the wine pairing. Everything was perfect. Service was quick. Server was polite and helpful but could improve to match the higher end of the restaurant.

Atelier,50,awesome experience,"All the dishes were delicious. We really liked the desserts, they were surprisingly good. Highly recommend for special occasions."

Atelier,50,Get comfy! Amazing experience like no other,"A very different approach to a dining experience. Unbelievable presentation of each course. One more creative than the next. The mix of flavours, colours and aromas is also a next level experience. Delicious! Great staff and service during a long and enjoyable dinner. It's amazing how knowledgeable they are and how much they remember when describing the meal. Overall excellent food and dining experience. One to remember for a long time."

Atelier,30,"Enjoyable, but improvements are needed","Atelier serves a 12 course dinner with the option of an “extended pairing” of wines or a regular pairing. I recommend the extended pairing, which contains better quality wines, although it consists mostly of white wines with a couple of red wines for the courses near the end. First impressions are important; however, Atelier failed on this point. The exterior of the restaurant is not well maintained. There was a “rock garden” in front that was full of weeds. The front window is covered in a metal grill, making Atelier look like a jail. The tables are too close together, and the lighting is too dim with a dark interior. The tables are not covered in linen. They should consider moving to a nicer establishment. My wife is gluten-free and instead of bread, they served her a bowl of popcorn ! This was a highly disappointing start to the dinner. Half the dishes were very flavorful and well presented, such as the duck course and the bison course. However, some of the dishes completely lacked flavor. For example, the blueberry cheesecake in the final course consisted of a frozen blueberry shell. Surprisingly, it had no flavor at all, tasting instead like a piece of ice. As another example, one of the courses contained a “rope” of corn made using liquid nitrogen; it also lacked any flavor. Most of the wine pairings were white wines, which were too sweet. Atelier should consider adding more red wines to the pairings. However, the sommelier, Devan, was very knowledgeable. If you are expecting Michelin star quality, you will be disappointed. Still, it was mostly an enjoyable experience."

Atelier,50,Fantastic!,Our dinner was absolutely delicious and our waiter was so fun. The beef tongue was by far my favourite dish and my husband could have eaten 50 of the cherry desserts!

Atelier,50,Amazing dining experience,"My husband and I received a gift certificate for Atelier from our son.  We did not know what to expect, as we had never heard of this restaurant. Certainly not inexpensive( around $400 for two people), however definitely worth the experience.    The service was impeccable. The servers, especially Laura,and the sommelier were knowledgable and took care of making sure every need was met. The food was creative and delicious. We especially loved the parsnip soup, the Sarsaparilla duck, the Lamb and clementine as well as the Blueberry cheesecake dessert. The wine pairings were spot on and enhanced the flavors of the food. The decor was simple (not what we expected), yet clean and not overly crowded. Wonderful experience! I would recommend Atelier for any special occasion, or for tourists in town wanting an extraordinary dining experience."

Atelier,50,More than a Restaurant--Total Experience,The service at Atelier is like no other. You are greeted by name when you arrive. You feel like a dear family friend and not a customer. They learn your likes and dislikes when you make your reservation. They know your alergies or food oddities.

Atelier,50,12 course meal with every dish a highlight,"this is a different restaurant. They only serve a 12 course small dish meal and you get what they are serving that day. Takes 3 hours but the time goes by fast as they serve at a pleasant pace. There is a wine pairing for each dish, we asked to have a half portion as the full portion seems like a lot of wine.    Service is great, you have one waiter who explains each dish. As well there is a wine stewerd who also explains each wine. Sure go through a lot of glasses and cutlery!    Our 12 dishes were: Radish and asparagus in a glass bowl, peas and dill, Turnip cake, parsnip soup, Short rib, Trout, Crab and corn, Pork, Duck, Lamb and Clemintine, Cucumber and white chocolate and finally Blueberry cheesecake. Each dish had a number of ingredients and was presented beautifully.    The restaurant is in an out of the way former narrow house with only a very small sign in front. This is place you know about and seek out.    It is an event, quite frankly expensive, ($380 all in) for 2 with half wine pairing each. With all the attention to detail both in service and food, understand why is so expensive. If you have 3 hours to eat in Ottawa and you enjoy fine cooking, a must visit place"

Atelier,50,Impeccable Dining Experience,"Atelier deserves all its rave reviews. All plates are meticulously presented, thought provoking, and delicious. The wine pairings were quite eclectic; an Ontario Champagne, an Ontario Chardonnay/Riesling, a Greek Rose, to name a few. impeccable, attentive, service. You would feel comfortable here dressed up for a special occasion or dressed in casual attire. Well worth the splurge!"

Atelier,50,Enjoyable dinner,"This is a molecular gastronomic menu of 12 courses. Menu is innovative. Full menu given at end of meal. If you choose wine pairing, drink menu will also be given at the end. For $125, you get every penny worth. Service was excellent and accommodating with us late for 30 min due to no Uber availability. Food is fine and of good value. Some surprises like corn purée frozen noodle, bone marrow made into powder form. Included beef, pork, lamb, duck, and fish. The only one warning is to start your dinner early like 6 pm as the meal lasted over 3.5 hrs. The chef let us look at the garden in the backyard from the 2nd floor. Definitely worth a try if one has not been to a molecular gastronomy."

Atelier,50,Highlight of Our Trip,"When we are on vacation, we love to splurge on incredible meals. This was easily one of the best we have ever enjoyed in any location. Not only were the ingredients perfectly selected, the presentations were unexpected yet perfect. Also, it is a very small restaurant, so our three tables of strangers became convivial friends in short order. Take the leap, get the wine pairings and enjoy a fabulous time!"

Atelier,40,Unique presentation and attentive service,The restaurant decor is underwhelming but the creativity and diversity of the 12 courses served was impressive! The sophisticated and interesting dishes were worth the premium price!

Atelier,50,Top Ottawa dining experience,"After many months in Ottawa, visiting plenty of restaurants, it was time to try the one most highly commended to us.    Before we begin, it is worth noting that you are prepared for the evening with a confirmation call, during which you are reminded that the sitting will be for around 3-3.5 hours. This seemed a long time, even for a 12-course degustation. However, I would say it was well worth it and we left very satisfied with the evening's entertainment.    If you want low budget, this is not for you. If you are after a dining experience where a chef has clearly sought to entertain with the food and the presentation, Atelier is well worth a visit.    I won't step you through course by course because it would very likely remove some of the fun for you, but there are some pictures that show you most of the journey.    The wine pairings were great, though the sherry to start was a little rough for my taste - I would just pause to highlight that sherry is not something I enjoy, though it was very nice with the oyster. We had the extended pairing (12 wines) and none disappointed when paired. If I were to make a small suggestion, I would say perhaps pour slightly less for each of the wines on the extended pairing as we ended up well over the quoted 'around' three glasses. This made for a merry night, but did make tasting the final couple of wines a little difficult to fully enjoy. These are tiny things and if I went back and it was the same I would walk away as happy as I did the first time."

Atelier,50,Extra special tasting menu - A treat for everyone,Atelier has been our go to place for those very extra special occasions since it first opened. The tasting menu with the wine parings ... it is bucket list dinner ... enjoy!

Atelier,50,fine dinning experience,"You should book ahead and know that you need to take your time to enjoy the experience. It is not for those on a budget, but you'd enjoy the experience,"

Atelier,30,Left somewhate disappointed,"This was our third time going to the Atelier restaurant since it opened. Our first time was in 2009 and then 2011 and last night. I must say, things have changed since it opened 10 years ago. First off, we went again for my birthday. 8 years ago, when we went, I had received a special molecular desert and a special mention. Last night, even though when my husband was called to confirm the reservation and that we were celebrating my birthday, there was nothing special of the sort and not even a happy birthday...which left my husband and myself disappointed as we ""expected"" a little something special.    Now to continue with the review. 10 years ago, the menu was much more ""molecular"" than it is today which again left me let down. Yes it still has ""freeze dried"" items on the plates as well as smoke and foam but it is not what it was when they first opened. I believe a guest had asked the same question to our waiter as we heard him reply that the molecular type of cooking was not very well received and therefore they were now more of a ""gastronomic cooking with some molecular twist"". We went because of what it used to be so yes, we were not completely satisfied.    Some of the dishes were a hit and miss but that is subjective and due to each preferences. Some of the dishes that I liked my husband did not and vice versa. But for 350$ for 2 you'd expect to love the dishes.    I remember our first 2 times, receiving small amount of food at a time we thought we would never fill up on this but always ended up leaving full and content. Last night was not the case and we actually left hungry...hungry enough to go by some munchies before heading home and watching a movie....you'd think that again, for the amount of money paid, that would not be the case. So we left wondering, have the portion size changed?    The final desert of the night fell flat. The idea is to have a whiskey caramel sauce poured over a cherry sorbet ball and have the ball melt under the heat and open up. It worked for the table beside us. When we received ours, the waiter poured and I guess the sauce was not warm enough...we were left with a whiskey caramel cherry sorbet ball and no effect what so ever.    Happy we went a third time...sure, but not thrilled. Would recommend, sure maybe once if you've never been but not if you've been before, especially if it's been a long time as things are just not quite the same. Will we go back? Not sure but probably not. It was OK but there are other restaurants that I'd like to try in and around our nation's capital."

Balthazar,20,"Not what it used to be and, certainly, not what it purports to be now.","We came from the UK for a special trip to NYC. My then partner and I had been to Balthazar 10-15 years before and loved it which is why we booked it again for this special trip. My now husband and I were approaching our 1st wedding anniversary and it was my sister and brother in laws first time in the US. So, we ate this time on the evening of the 11th October, a mild evening, an outside table thank god because the inside was rammed and unbearably loud. Service was great but that’s where it started and stopped. The food was very average. My husband said his salmon was insipid. The drinks, oh my god, the drinks. My vodka martini, extra dry, straight up with a twist was watery. My sister’s cider was served in a wine glass and was barely 150ml for $13 - see pic, that was it before she sipped it! The rest of the meal was so average - my steak was dry and the frites same - and then there’s the kicker, the bill. I forget the actual amount but for what little we had, it was about $450. Don’t! Just don’t! There’s a whole swathe of better, newer places in that area and Balthazar, whatever it once was, it’s not that anymore. Walk on by!"

Balthazar,10,Disappointing,"Only reason for 1 star is cos there’s no option for 0 stars. Not worth any service let alone 20 - 25 %. Pathetic excuse for a Bloody Mary, it’s fine to charge a fortune for stuff because of your location and your relying on your iconic name. But don’t take 20 minutes to make it, and if you do make sure it’s good. Staff all seem to stand around laughing and joking with each other rather than serve the customers. Avoid this place like the plague. Staff are rude and uninterested."

Balthazar,50,Fav soho restaurant,One of the most iconic restaurants in soho. I always love to spend time there and enjoying their burgers or stakes

Balthazar,10,Overhyped. Not good at all.,"The food was really bad. Overhyped restaurant. We went with a couple of tourists and thought it would be a good place. The service was bad, to took them hours. The food was mediocre. I would recommend to go There."

Balthazar,10,Not worth the wait and your money,"The place is overrated, outdated and not innovative, neither in design nor in dishes. There are much better new places in New York!"

Balthazar,10,DO NOT GO HERE,utter garbage. do not waste your time here. the food is slop. the atmosphere is grim. the staff is miserable. the owner is obviously incompetent

Balthazar,10,Don’t bother,Terrible food. Terrible people. Don’t give them your business. The food is second rate. Chicken small. Served with an attitude.

Balthazar,40,Very busy because it’s VERY good,"We randomly walked by and decided to have lunch here and what a great meal! The place is noisy and busy, busy, busy but the food hits the mark. We had the Balthazar salad, foie gras terrain, the goat cheese and onion tart, and the toasted French ham and Gruyère sandwich. All were delicious, but the goat cheese tart was above and beyond! Great service in a nice older building. Full bar. I will definitely be back here."

Balthazar,50,Absolutely wonderful!,"My very first time eating at Balthazar. I had a friend who raved about it and this time in NYC, I went. Service, food, drinks, dessert - absolutely wonderful. I am already planning my next trip there when I am in NYC."

Balthazar,40,Close to being in France,"The onion soup was by far one of the best onion soups we’ve had in the US! We came here for everything French. Snails and onion soup was our favorites. The tender beef with pasta, truffle macaroni, mussels, and the eggs Benedict was all spot on. Service was good and the atmosphere reminds us of Paris."

Balthazar,10,The food isn’t the same here anymore. It’s terrible now,"The food is absolutely awful. It used to be good a few years ago but is complete trash these days. Trust me, don’t come here anymore."

Balthazar,10,You can’t make this up.. unpleasant,"I couldn't believe the bizarre experience we had at this restaurant. The owner, Keith, sat alone at the table next to us, exuding an unfriendly vibe that made the atmosphere incredibly unpleasant. The staff seemed visibly afraid by him; one server's hands were trembling as they served him. To add to the oddity, Keith controlled the restaurant's music from his phone, repeatedly blasting it loudly and then abruptly lowering the volume, creating a disruptive and uncomfortable environment."

Balthazar,10,Why oh why…,Why oh why would anyone throw their hard earned money away at this overpriced pretentious food factory. Service poor and only outshined by the lackluster taste of their ridiculous food.

Balthazar,40,Quintessential SoHo Brasserie,"This bustling brasserie serving traditional French fare ( breakfast through supper )is well worth a visit - though don't forget to book in advance. Massively popular, and rightly so, it's a fun experience, great to look at and for soaking in the New York brunch, lunch or dinner set. Cleverly crafted to look and feel a whole lot older than it is - the vibe is fun and boisterous and certainly feels authentic enough for Paris. Food is well prepared and consistent and the Patisserie next door should also be visited. Go."

Balthazar,30,"Going away, the wrong way","Balthazar was a famous pirate if you know your history. Balthazar is the fabulous creation of British restaurateur Keith McNally, if you know your New York. This morning I found the latter going away, the wrong way. No more “Belle Epoque” French, where gilded mirrors, tiles, tall ceilings, French speaking waiters and excellent food and service were the norm. It’s now Russian receptionist with manners from the Cold War, Easter European servers wearing baseball caps (a sacrilege in a French restaurant), Oriental help who don’t speak English and rushed (at best) service. Food is still good, but severely overpriced for what it is and the wine list is just ridiculous. So sad.  **"

Balthazar,40,Paris in New York,"Typical French brasserie. Good food. Efficient service. We especially enjoy brunch at Balthazar and we have been on several occasions. Unfortunately, every time, we notice how the restrooms do not get cleaned regularly. They are filthy with paper all over the floor."

Balthazar,30,Very Slow and without information,I have been to Balthazar many times. They were always fast serving the food. This time it took more that 1 hour since we sat down and our waitress never informed us that there was going to be a delay or there was a problem at the kitchen. Having your clients sat down for 1 hour without food or explanations is terrible service.

Balthazar,50,Our go-to-place,Over the years this restaurant have evolved to be one of our favorite restaurants in NYC and it did not let us down this time as well. Very good food and staff that are most professional in the way they carry themselves.

Balthazar,50,"Amazing food, service and ambiance","Went here on a whim during a shopping day visit to Soho with a group of friends.  Beautiful outdoor patio. We were a big group of 9 and the restaurant was able to quickly set a long table for us inside by the window.  Food was all amazing. They give delicious bread baskets with gorgeous sourdough. Wonderful ambiance and our waiter was bilingual English/French.  Drinks were great. Service was fast and they even split our bills, which made payment very easy.  A lovely place, fun and even a bit romantic. What a gem."

Balthazar,50,Still excellent in every way,"Haven’t been here for a decade and lots has changed in NYC, but the quality of food and service at Balthasar hasn’t. It has the slightly hectic, happening vibe of somewhere everyone wants to be, with a menu for all tastes, excellently executed with great, attentive service. Our party ate oysters, steak, goats cheese tart, duck, onion soup, bouillabaisse and two desserts - all excellent. In a city where it’s hard to find decent food, treat yourself here."

BED New York,50,My fav,"Basically, that’s New York. Service: 10/10. Had a dirty martini with a terrific view. Everything was perfectly handled. I had such a New Yorker vibes. Thank you. The experience is a lifetime worthy."

BED New York,50,Speechless,"There are no words to describe this experience! Probably, one of the greatest rooftop of New York. Tasted an extra dry Martini with a view. That’s New York."

BED New York,50,Wild Fashion Week Party,"Great drinks, bttere people watching and best of all an incredible view from the iconic boom boom room -- you heard me."

BED New York,50,Fun trip to NY,Always love eating here. Great food and good service! Had a friend visiting from Scotland who will definitely come back.

BED New York,40,fantastic views,the place has fantastic views and certainly of the best ones...we made booking in advance..the drinks were superb ...the passion fruit mock-tail was particularly good...we were comfortably seated in a place which had an amazing views of the NYC skyline and the river...

BED New York,50,Amazing,"Don't miss this bar, this is simply incredible! The view on Manhattan is wonderful. (The price for a cocktail is approximately $20)"

BED New York,50,A happy accident - thanks Jade,"I wrapped up dinner and was about to head home early when Jade, a manager, suggested The Top of The Standard. I had no idea there was a club upstairs! Good music, good vibe and I even burned off some calories dancing! :D"

BED New York,50,Christmas Jazz Night,"We went there on Christmas Day. Booked ahead so we get very nice table with Hudson River View. The food, service, ambience, music were really good."

BED New York,50,New York Excellence!,"My friends I were greeted with a warm welcome and seated in front of the fireplace overlooking the entire city! What a view! We enjoyed the buzzing energy of the live Jazz. Our cocktail waitress introduced herself and walked us through the cocktail menu. We told her our alcohol of choice and she recommended the ideal drinks to start our evening. The service staff was so efficient and the food was to die for. We ordered the sashimi & sliders which were so diving I would go back just for the sliders. This is the perfect choice if you are looking to impress any out of town guests, a date, or a life long New Yorker. Make sure you use the restroom too! Its an exciting treat you have to see for yourself."

BED New York,50,Exquisite Cocktail Experience,"From the moment of our arrival and throughout the evening, our experience at The Boom Boom Room exceeded all expectations! The hostess was welcoming and genuinely gracious, the servers were friendly and extremely accommodating, and the food was nothing less than absolutely divine! We were seated in a secluded corner spot that felt private, yet had an amazing view of the Manhattan skyline. It was truly a memorable and one of a kind experience!"

BED New York,50,Great cocktails and dessert.,Great cocktails and dessert. Our waitress Monica took care of us with good humor. My family had a blast with the photo booth in the basement!

BED New York,50,"Great food, view, and entertainment","With a live band playing easy and familiar classic tunes and decor reminisce of an era distinguished by glamor and style, the lounge at The Top of the Standard was an enchanting place teeming with positive vibes. We were seated in a prime spot with a commanding view of the Hudson River. The menu sure did not disappoint. Thrilled that the food was outstanding, unlike places that give you good view and service and try to get away with less from the kitchen. Oyster and hamachi crudo were palate pleasers and well presented; the mini burgers (comes in 2 and in sensible size actually) with foie gras satisfied the carnivore in me. The shoe-string style frites with bearnaise sauce were addictive! We perhaps should have skipped the Korean fried chicken as unknowingly we ordered a tad too much.  We don't frequent lounges, but the overall experience of this 18th floor hot spot in the chic High Line neighborhood might just lure us back more frequently."

BED New York,50,Date night,"Thoroughly enjoyed a delightful night out with husband. I even indulged in a glass of burgundy, while my hubby ordered casamigo on the rock to get into the mood. Although the weather wasn’t spectacular, the view from the 18th floor at dusk was still magical. To our surprise, the food was outstanding! We sampled a few items: king crab roll, oysters, hamachi crudo, Korean spicy fried chicken, and we seized the opportunity to enjoy foie gras which was sandwiched between a perfectly prepared hamburger. It might be our last time getting foie gras as it will soon be a banned item in New York! We decided to try the frites with bearnaise sauce which was divine! We finished the meal with a pretty dessert named Gold Bar. Service was excellent too. Our server Lily was attentive and responsive. This is definitely a night out in Manhattan done right!"

BED New York,50,Boom Boom Room is dynamite!!,"A must go for a Blast from the Past. The views are great, especially from your own private bathroom, no kidding. Service was excellent and the servers are super. They have live music, jazz, when we were there. This is a A+ gem!! We didn't have dinner, but their small plates are superb."

BED New York,50,AMAZING VIEWS,Great views and ambience. We had cocktails and watched the sunset from here. Staff are helpful and smartly turned out. There was live music and although it was busy it was not particularly noisy. Definitely worth a visit if in the area.

BED New York,50,views,Excellent for a predinner drink. Amazing views and cocktails and great jazz. Enjoyed and would recommend

BED New York,50,Love every minute of the TOP of the Standard!!!,"We came here by 5:00pm on a Saturday and we got a window table with two seats with no reservations that over look the Hudson River, and the West Side Highway. The place wasn’t crowded and the jazz band was just getting there and setting up.    A couple of nice cocktails before our dinner somewhere else in the city and and we were in heaven!!! We also ordered the KFC tapas style bites, no, not the Kentucky Colonel, Korean Fried Chicken, and the cheese plate. Nice spicy little chicken nuggets with a slight kick and the cheese dish was soft, creamy and well blended with the sugar coated walnuts, beehive honey, and the nice crunchy crustini.  Nice bar, attractive little tables, nice gold decor, and the wait staff was dressed to the T’s.    We both loved it and we will be back!!!  Cheers!!!🍸🍸🍸🍺🍺🍺"

BED New York,50,Uber Bar!,"What a delightful time we had at my favorite bar in NYC! The top of the Standard has stunning views, a fantastic jazz duo and Josh, a bar tender par excellence who stirs up delicious cocktails like my favorite negroni, and variations of it. A perfect ending to our visit to one of the best cities in the world."

BED New York,50,Amazing,"What can I say, it was one of my favorite moments in NY. Amazing view, great design, good cocktail. Recommended."

BED New York,50,The fight to save a special night from becoming a nightmare. I was so disappointed at the aggravation we experienced.,The top of the Standard’ is one of my favorite places in New York so although my night was rough I can’t bare to give this a bad review however maybe upper management can make the necessary changes to insure a smooth reservation. I booked a reservation two weeks in advance for a 30th birthday party and I booked a specific location in the restaurant however when we arrived I was informed that my area was no longer available and the initial place they wanted to place us was behind the band. This was unacceptable on every level and I was not going for it at all I asked for the manager who did not want to see my countless emails that insured where my seating was supposed to be after a strong back and forth conversation I was told they didn’t receive that messaging on their end and after a wait we were placed in the right section. I understand that places get overbooked or things happen however if I had just accepted it or stormed out our night would have been totally ruined because they were ready to seat us anywhere they could . I was super disappointed in the beginning but as the night progressed and the champagne poured our waitress made sure we were in good spirits. I can say the manager sent a glass of champagne for our troubles however those who are long time customers and who take the proper steps of showing up on time and booking ahead of time should never go through this aggravation. I hope that my next reservation will not test my patience or stress me out before a momentous occasion.

BED New York,50,Amazing Bar,This is a cool spot with fantastic views and tasty drinks. I found the service to be on point. The hostess and waitress were friendly and got us a table for four quickly. No long wait. Try an old fashioned. Pretty good.

BED New York,50,FANTASTIC views and service,"We went for pre dinner drinks before going to another restaurant. The views were amazing, the service great with a musician playing a trumpet. A great experience."

BED New York,10,The hostess made my evening horrible / Katrina is not a full representation of this amazing establishment,It was our 25th anniversary and usually the ambiance and hostess are amazing at this establishment however upon my arrival it was mass confusion checking in the hostess was cold and callous and unprofessional. I’ve been a customer for years and i will not return because of this hostess it’s a sad end to an era but management will need to get potential candidates more carefully.

BED New York,50,A highlight of NYC not to be missed!,"Myself and my partner have had the pleasure of visiting this place twice on our holidays to NYC and I cannot recommend it enough! The bar is beautifully decorated with a gorgeous eloquent aesthetic which makes you feel welcome. The view of Manhattan is stunning and I recommend seeing it at nighttime for full effect! Our experience this time was made extra special by Raffinee who provided us with the most amazing service. Raffinee was attentive, friendly, sociable and such a delight to speak to. She looked after us and was incredible with her knowledge of the food and drinks menus, giving us recommendations based on what we said we liked! Raffinee is a credit to The Standard and is a true example of what outstanding customer service can look like. Thank you again! I cannot recommend The Top of The Standard enough!"

BED New York,40,Special occasion spot,"My mom and I were visiting NYC and went to The Top of the Standard for a special drink after my birthday dinner (on a Sunday night). It definitely fit the bill in terms of feeling very special. The decor and view is beautiful and magical in the evening. Make sure to stop in the bathroom. My jaw dropped when I went in. I would probably check out different bars for a special occasion next time primarily because we felt rather out of place and found the general atmosphere a bit snooty (which I suppose is sometimes something to be expected in such a place). When we arrived, they asked if we had a reservations which we did not, but they let us in anyway and informed us we would either need to check our coats or keep them on and we could not drop them over the back of our chairs (this is when we knew we were out of our league). When we went in, the bar was stunning but upon looking around all of the empty tables and chairs had reserved signs and the bar was full. My mom almost made us walk out because she felt uncomfortable and we certainly didn’t want to stand to have a drink. I asked the bartender (who was very kind and polite) if all the tables were truly full. He said to talk to the hostess. So we trotted back out and asked the hostess if any of the reserved tables were available. She brought us back in and seated us at a table away from the hubbub with a stellar view of the city. We were glad to have our backs to the rest of the much hipper crowd so we could enjoy our view and special occasion drink without feeling out of place. The drink I had was well made, strong and expensive. Overall, we enjoyed our experience being a little out of our element in such a fancy place!"

BED New York,30,"Good experience, but is not jazz session",The drinks are very good. Too expensive and they are not offering jazz as they described on their website.

BED New York,50,Beautiful even in rough weather,"Had an amazing time last week at the top of the Standard. All the servers were excellent, drinks strong and food while smaller portions delicious. The trio with singer provided just the right atmosphere - not too loud or noticeable. Highly recommend."

BED New York,10,A favorite spot until our last visit,"There's no doubt this is one of the most beautiful rooms in the world with a great view to boot. Drinks are good as well as small bites. We had visited many times through the years and never hesitated bringing friends. Unfortunately, our last visit was an embarrassment. The girl who served us had odd and unpredictable mood swings. HR must identify an employee's strengths and weaknesses. Some employees do not belong in direct service roles. Ill-mannered types should be kept away from well heeled guests."

BED New York,40,Expensive but good,"For $409 a day, I was disappointed. Hotel was clean and modern but tub/shower was so tall I was afraid to get into it. Door on the toilet area was loud to close so if anyone was sleeping you would wake them up."

BED New York,10,Difficult waitress = unfortunate service,We felt terrible for our waitress at The Top of The Standard. My wife and I and other guests were treated to a roller coaster ride when she would turn from nice to nasty at a drop of a hat. We work with adults with self-esteem struggles and recognized them with her. Her manner was passive aggressive and all her tables were looking at each other in puzzlement. We hope The Standard Hotel offers its employees mental health assistance and an opportunity to work back of house until their struggles are eased. nk

BED New York,50,What a Place!,"Dress up and go up to the top of the Standard!  Very cool place!  Breathtaking 360 view of NYC.  Very professional service.  Nice drinks and cocktails, nice snacks and menu for your wine.  You will live music, mostly jazz and blues.  Nice crowd.  Really impressed!  Reservation is strongly recommended to avoid waiting and queues."

BED New York,40,Cocktails are not good enough for such a stunning place,"I really recommend to go, the place is Stunning with an amazing view of the city. People are quite relaxed! Qualitative alcohol but to be honest drinks were not so good..we took a mojito and a gin tonic and I would have expected more!"

BED New York,40,View!!!!,"Great view, very nice place to visit and have a few drinks. Innovative mixes for drinks. Service was very good. Music just the right volume. A bit on the expensive side and slightly pretentious for me. Service was very good."

BED New York,50,VIEW ALL OF NYC WITH A DRINK IN HAND,"After goingto the Whitney Museum or walking the High Line, be sure to stop here for a drink and THE VIEW."

BED New York,10,Snub waitress,"This review is regarding Friday (03/29/2019)  we decide that we want to spend time at this place , before get to our dinner -Del Posto- next review) .Reservation was made and instructions in our appearance and dress code well described ,...; the reservationist was specific in what kind of people they are looking for in there lounge ; “ we are looking for beautiful people and fashionable dressed “,!!!OK!  The service is miserable , my waitress snub /spurn /arrogant ,....you named !!!!!  We had our great champagne ( you can find in any great lounge / bar/ restaurant), 03 orders of food ( they are smaller them the most fancy places I know ) ! Food not bid deal , honesty i aspect a lot more ( I can have better and less not go to this contemptuous treatment)! The waitress only took our order neve get back to us we only order the second drink bc we order at the bar , and we take closed the check ! End of this nastiness !  Some people told me , that I need second time bc they believe our waitress was in bad blá-blá-blá , I can’t tell! Spend almost 400 d💵 and not have a good experience !! I don’t know if I get back !"

BED New York,50,Stunning restaurant with stunning views,This was our first visit to New York and we were truly glad we made the trip here. The decoration is very glamorous. It truly felt like New York city. The views from windows are amazing. We got a good view of the sunset which was breathtaking. We will definitely be back here on our next New York trip.

BED New York,50,Nice View and good Atmosphere,"We had no reservation and only wanted a couple of drinks before dinner. For the first half an hour we had to stand because it was absolutely packed. We enjoyed the view over the Hudson River. My daughter then managed to get us seats at the bar and only then could we hear that a Jazz Band was playing. Kelly Green was tickling the ivories and sang. Alan Trembley was on bass and Evan Hyde on drums. I must admit that I never heard of the trio but liked their numbers a lot  My daughter had a “Love Me Rita” cocktail made from Oaxecan Mezcal, Pineapple and Yuzu and Espelette and was served on the rocks.  Mine was a very powerful “Smoked Sazerac” Made with Whistle Pig Rye, Demerara and Absinthe, Peychaud’s Bitters and was smoked with Applewood and served straight. Wow.  My daughter loved Rita so much that she had one more whilst I enjoyed a Plymouth Gin very Dry Martini.  The bar was extremely busy with at least 4 mixologists doing their stuff.  Nice atmosphere and very friendly service."

BED New York,40,Great views of the city,The main selling point of this bar is that it really does have fantastic views of the city.  The downside was that some of the staff and in particular the host on the door was unfriendly.  It’s defo worth a visit for a couple of drinks and the photo opportunity but I prob wouldn’t stay longer than that.

Bistro Cassis,40,Excellent location,"The location is fabulous. We sat outside in a wonderful location people watching. Staff were a bit slow taking our order, so much so that we had to ask, twice, if someone would deal with us.  When we did place our order I can honestly say I was not disappointed. As a visitor to the USA I love to have a burger. The one served here was fantastic. Well worth it. Next time I'm there I'll call again."

Bistro Cassis,50,Very good like always but I would like my Lentil Salad,"Bring back the most delicious thing you have, warm Lentil Salad, since they opened I have been a customer there and it is what I always recommend. Por favor!"

Bistro Cassis,10,Disappointing,"Cassis has been my wife and I favorite places to go and take friends and family who are visiting. Unfortunately, the last several times the service has been poor, and pricing continues to go up. The last time we went was for Mother’s Day and we chalk up the slow service and average food which was a limited menu to the holiday! Even thought it was not that busy. We went last night a Friday night to celebrate a Birthday and again the service was awful. Our server would disappear for 10 to fifteen minutes at a time my daughter did not get her 1st drink for well over a half hour. I finished my 1st drink during the appetizer and was not able to get to order another drink until I was finished with my dinner, me and everyone else at the table, 9 of us needed a drink and we had to send another waiter who was dropping off a sauce that should have come with one of the meals which was already eaten at that point to let our waiter know we needed drinks. The drinks came 10 minutes later with the desert for the birthday person and the check for the table. With an average dinner at over $50 dollars, you would expect great food and even better service, but none of that happen for us. We will no longer go to Cassis. Not worth it!"

Bistro Cassis,10,What happened to this place??,"This used to be my favorite place downtown. Last night four of us went for dinner. We waited 30 minutes before anyone came over and that was after getting up to speak to the hostess. Waiter came finally and we decided order everything at once just in case he never came back. He didn’t. 45 minutes still no drinks. Appetizer comes still no drinks. Entrees come, wrong table. One hour in still no drinks or wine. Finished appetizers drinks come. Entrees come cold. Steak too rare but I wasn’t going to wait another hour. Oh here comes the wine. I actually went to the service area to get a pitcher of water. The service was so bad you had to laugh. In short bad service bad food and an altogether horrible night. There are so many other restaurants to choose from downtown I would skip this one"

Bistro Cassis,50,"Delicious dinner, good service","I just chose this restaurant on a street filled with different restaurants because French appealed to me. I chose to seat inside, summer is hot outside. I was pleased that the music was not too intrusive. I had decided from reading the menu before entering that I wanted the steak frites, a favorite. My waiter was most helpful. I added a cassis royale, like a kir royale - another favorite - but with cassis. It took a while for my meal to arrive. When it did it was delicious, the steak done perfectly and the frites thin and crispy. An excellent choice for a dinner alone."

Bistro Cassis,50,Delicious brunch,We had such a nice brunch here whilst visiting St Pete. The smoked salmon omelette was delicious as was the Cuban sandwich. Great service. Absolutely loved the mini Tabasco’s!!

Bistro Cassis,40,Good Breakfast,"Food and waitstaff great; hostess apparently isn’t having a good day— I was not greeted, even after I said hello. I was asked inside or outside, shown to my table and told the waiter would be with me shortly. That’s it. Don’t get me wrong, I know these jobs are hard, I have had more than one customer service restaurant and retail job too, but if your hostess isn’t friendly it’s a poor reflection on the business."

Bistro Cassis,50,Great for brunch with a great view on beach drive!,"Great spot to have brunch with a great view and good food! We sat outside in “the jungle” which I definitely recommend. It is a little hot but they do have fans going. We shared the French toast and breakfast burrito which was great and their breakfast potatoes, OMG ☺️! We also had the mimosa for 2 which gave us about 2 decent sized mimosas each with fresh squeezed OJ . Overall definitely worth the price point for what we had and the experience/environment. Side shout out to Alex for the friendly service and taking great care of us."

Bistro Cassis,50,Great Spot,"Excellent food, beautiful restaurant. Bartender Dave was very hard working and attentive. We will be back."

Bistro Cassis,30,bad fish,"I got the salmon with miso (a simple slab of salmon with a thin coating of miso). The salmon tasted old and when we mentioned this to the manager he simply said, 'oh, thank you for telling me that.' An odd response: no apology, no offer for a replacement, no refund. In general the food is overpriced for its average quality. Entrees are mostly $38 but the creativity and quality is not much better than a surf and turf joint."

Bistro Cassis,50,Great brunch near St Pete pier,"Our family (party of 7, including a 2 year old) decided to try Sunday brunch at Cassis. Some of us had stayed 2 nights at the Hilton a few blocks away, and family in town met us at Cassis, we chose it because from walking past the 2 previous nights it looked very charming, outside seating, attractive decor, and we thought the menu looked good, so we decided to try it. Our family in Tampa had never been there either. We were seated right away -did not have a reservation- at the back inside -outside was nice, a lovely day- but with the 6 of us plus baby in high chair, we were happy to be out of the way of other diners, and the seating was perfect for us. We had a very nice and professional server, he totally had it all under control, brought us banana bread to make the baby and 7 year old happy right away, and delicious rolls for the rest of us. Everything was excellent-food and exceptional service. We ordered everything from calamari, Brie and portobello omelet, breakfast burritos, French toast and pancakes. All well presented and delicious. We all agreed it was a great place. We will definitely go back there on our next visit. It’s in a great spot near the pier, good for walking, shopping, galleries, Cassis is in the heart of a really cool area overall. We were very impressed!"

Bistro Cassis,50,Best soup ever,Wow. Just amazing. I had the soup of the day and it was squash and carrot. I was leary of it but the waiter talked me into. It was one of the best soups I have ever had. I also got the toast with burrata cheese and pomegranates. It was also delicious. I absolutely loved my meal and will dine again while I am visiting here!

Bistro Cassis,50,Lovely lively spot on Beach drive,Lovely spot on Beach Drive. Everything was excellent quality. Very popular spot with locals so visitors take a hint….we had brunch on a Friday and it was busy so make a reservation and enjoy. I checked out the other menus and they looked great too. Service was friendly and efficient but not invasive - a balance that is hard to get right. The bread is amazing…..heard it was French owned which explains why it was so good.

Bistro Cassis,40,Good lunch spot,"Wife and I (60's) had lunch here while walking around St Petersburg on vacation. Good location. Service OK. Had salad and glass of wine, which were very good. Offer indoor and outside dining."

Bistro Cassis,40,not bad,"went for brunch - not bad at all - food pretty good - Overpriced - but you pay for location and on a lovely sunny morning, it's not too bad - service is very good"

Bistro Cassis,50,Dinner,"Excellent meal no reservations on sat we decided to sit at the bar. I had scallops /2peas …wonderful. Our bartender was attentive , atmosphere lively. Will certainly return"

Bistro du Vent,50,Dinner with dear friends!!,"Could have been on Paris... Awesome food, great price. exceptional service. Will definitely add this restaurant to my ""must go"" list when in Halifax. Thank you Alex!!+"

Bistro du Vent,50,Very Nice Evening,"A group of eight of us visited this restaurant on a Sunday evening. We had reservations so we were seated immediately. The server soon arrived to greet us, provide menus and take our beverage orders. My wife and I ordered the ribs as an appetizer. Others ordered the soup. The appetizers were tasty. For the main meal, my wife ordered the seafood crepe. I ordered the evening’s special, smoked salmon. Others ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon, the lamb, and the seafood crepe. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Some of us ordered dessert, lemon parfait pie, crème brûle, cheesecake and chocolate decadence. They were all very good. The server was very attentive."

Bistro du Vent,50,Fabulous experience twice in a row!,"We enjoyed our first dinner at Le Bistro by Liz so much, we went a second night. Traveling to Halifax from Connecticut for the first time, we had our puck of the city’s restaurants; and so we were so glad to find such a warm host (Liz herself) and excellent French food near our hotel. It’s not fancy, so you can have everything from snails to a croque monsieur to scallops. Open for lunch and dinner, and located near the beautiful botanic garden."

Bistro du Vent,50,"Ooh, la la!","We had a delightful dining experience here on our first day in Halifax. Colin was perfect in his service, assisting us in our menu and wine selections. We began with the escargot - so decadent and so good! I had the special veal bolognese over linguini. Oh, it was so good! My partner had the scallops, which were equally good. We left feeling buoyed for the evening ahead!"

Bistro du Vent,50,Exceeded our Expectations,"This was everything we expected. I had changed our dinner reservation time several times because of airline time changes. Liz was extremely accommodating and pleasant to deal with. We had the most perfect waitress and our food was fantastic. After a long travel day, we both ordered the fish and chips and it was by far the best we have ever had. It was fresh, flaky and done perfectly. If we return to Halifax, we would return without a heart beat. Wonderful experience."

Bistro du Vent,50,Excellent small restaurant,Excellent food and service. The range of food was very good. The food arrived promptly and was very well presented and the taste was amazing

Bistro du Vent,50,A fine meal on vacation,What a great experience we had here. The ambience was great. The food was quite tasty. The portions were generous. The staff was very friendly. Good selection of food. The spaghetti Aglio e Olio was very tasty with layers of flavor. The lamb shank was huge and very tender. Minestrone was a great flavorful dish. Deserts of warm apple crumble and rainbow sorbet were excellent

Bistro du Vent,50,Great French Bistro,"Great French bistro menu with lots of choices. Had the lobster vol au vent, which has a flaky shell with tasty tarragon sauce over a lobster tail. The seafood risotto was a tasty variation with plentiful seafood over the risotto rice. The rice itself was average in texture and taste. Good wine selection at decent prices. Great friendly service, especially from the owner Liz. Good dining space with comfy French bistro vibe."

Bistro du Vent,50,An old favourite returns,"This place will take you straight to Paris! Great food, wine, and atmosphere. My wife took me to dinner there in 1996; it had been a favourite spot for her family for years.  Somewhere along the way it changed ownership and style, but a former employee has since bought it and restored it to its glory."

Bistro du Vent,10,Denied service,"Walked half hour to this restaurant and was refused service.  They had a large table and said they were too busy and we would have to come back in 40 minutes.  Didn’t offer to let us sit at the bar to have a drink or even offer us a table if we chose to wait - as there were plenty of empty tables.  They were closing in an hour so they indicated if we did get served we would have to eat it right away.  I was actually stunned they didn’t offer to let us sit and have a drink - I asked- couldn’t we still get a table and just have a drink while the kitchen gets caught up on orders.  No response so my husband just said we will go elsewhere.  A group walked in after us who was seated with a reservation and I overheard them being told they would have about a 15 minute wait to be served any food or drinks.  I’ve never been turned away from a restaurant before so I don’t know what to say other than I will never attempt to return.  I don’t know if it was because I wasn’t dressed fancy enough or what but to not even let us sit at the bar , I don’t know. Just seemed really strange to me."

Bistro du Vent,50,Best little bistro,"The best restaurant we experienced in halifax!  We couldn't get enough of Le Bistro by Liz.  She is the owner and what a host! She's there everyday, greeting you at the door, such hospitality.  Her staff are amazing, Matthew and Kristen, just to mention a few, go above and beyond your needs!  And the food, spectacular!!!  Looking forward to going back Le Bistro by Liz"

Bistro du Vent,50,"LeBistro By Liz, a Stupendous French Bistro in the heart of Halifax, NS.","Visited here Canada Day weekend for an excellent Brunch. (Served from 11:00 to 3:00 every Saturday and Sunday). Variety is fabulous, atmosphere is sweet, the servers are friendly/very attentive and the owner, Liz, is the best of the best.  The Brunch menu has so much to pick from, and all entrees include a complimentary mimosa, bloody mary, caesar or juice.  Yesterday I had the Yogourt Martini: greek yogourt with mixed berries and housemade granola, (in a martini glass, but be careful not to tip your glass over like I did, it is top heavey)!!! :) comes with a side of toasted banana bread. Absolutely divine.  One other guest had the Savory Breakfast Crepes and was swept away with the portion size and delectable taste!  The other two guests had the Omelette du jour and was also very pleased. Seriously folks, get yourself over to this sweet little French Bistro day or night because you are not going to find a better place in Halifax with such excellent food/service and these unbelievable prices.  Bon appetit ya'll.  Bonjour Liz!"

Bistro du Vent,50,Lovely European Vibes,"Great spot for European vibes, great service and delicious food options. I had crêpes florentine with an add on for $2 of orange almond salad. Delicious!!Complimentary mimosas or juice. Husband had meat omelette with 6 cheeses. Also delicious. Home fries, not our taste, but included if you like. Staff very friendly!  Real napkins. Water left on table.  Bathrooms are clean and hallway nicely decorated. Love the restaurant feel and decor.  I used to come here before Liz owned and now will be back!"

Bistro du Vent,40,A Nice French Touch,"Parking is a challenge and the restaurant is rather warm. The service was good, and the food good to great. Try the haddock au citron, it is exceptional. They advertise as vegetarian friendly but unless you only want to eat small plates, this is a challenge. Some pet peeves, when you order your appetizer before your place the order for salads and mains, you expect it to arrive first and I hate it when you have to keep the same cutlery for the whole meal. Service was also a bit rushed.  The food is moderately priced and they have a small but excellent wine list and very reasonable prices. The deserts are amazing, all in all a good experience and I would go again but it would be nice if they had more vegetarian options. They also have great coffee. A few minor improvements and they would go from good to great."

Bistro Le Steak,20,Bum’s rush out the door,"You can’t go back…  Something’s are better left as a memory and our experience here should have stayed that way.  After several years, we returned to Paris and reserved our table. We were looking forward to a quiet intimate good meal. We didn’t want anything fancy just solid French bistro food.  The food was adequate but left us without the feeling of ever needing to go back.  The house wine was not good but we didn’t want to complain. We were packed into the restaurant like sardines and to add to our discomfort the table next to us was told to hurry up and order after they brought the specials board over. We were there for one hour when we were told we needed to pay the check that people were waiting for our reserved table. Never did I expect to feel as if I would be hurried in a bistro in Paris! Terrible! As we walked back to our hotel, we looked at all the other wonderful restaurants we could have gone to instead and actually had been able to digest our meal."

Bistro Le Steak,50,The best in Paris!,"The best in Paris! We come to Paris often and Bistrot Henri is a “must go” … the food is superb, atmosphere chic and French and the Owner/Manager ( Julian ) a gem of a man….Highly recommend! Vicki and David Greve Pgh usa"

Bistro Le Steak,50,Great bistro in Saint Germain des prez,Excellent French comfort food in a cozy and lively spot. Try the duck it was great. Staff friendly as were other diners.

Bistro Le Steak,50,Great French bistro,"I enjoyed a solo meal at Bistro d’Henri my 1st night in Paris. It’s a small place with what appeared to be 1 chef and 1 waiter running the place. I started with the goat cheese salad with pesto tapenade and then Chicken with mushrooms and potatoes. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the mushroom cream sauce was rich and well seasoned. (Only bad part was that the bread served was stale). I would recommend it if you are looking for a small, authentic French bistro experience."

Bistro Le Steak,50,Perfect!,"Me and my daughter thoroughly enjoyed her first Parisian bistro experience. We ate delicious duck and lamb chops, both served with divine gratin dauphinois. We also polished off a superb Crème brûlée each. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I have a nut allergy and the proprietor was very reassuring, letting me know there were no nuts used at all on the menu."

Bistro Le Steak,50,Wonderful food and friendly service!,"Amazing food and fun friendly service! I ordered the duck with honey glaze and it was so amazing! I loved the ambience and feel of the small restaurant, and it felt very authentic. I also had the crème brûlée for desert which was also fantastic. I would highly recommend and will be coming back on my next visit."

Bistro Le Steak,50,So good we went twice,"We liked this place so much that it was the only restaurant my family dined at twice during our 5-night stay in Paris--our first and last nights. It's cozy and full of character. Most importantly, the food is excellent--not Michellin level but the best we had during our trip. There are no gimmicks, just great atmosphere and good food. We booked a day in advance for both of our visits. This was key, since it was always full."

Bistro Le Steak,40,A favorite spot!,"I was here 20 years ago and it was just as good as I remembered. Classic neighborhood bistro. Lovely, cozy atmosphere. Had a great dinner with my teenage son and husband. We all had delicious dinners, but I had the boeuf bourguignon and it was the winner. I would highly recommend it."

Bistro Le Steak,50,Highly recommend,"Very authentic, awesome service, super friendly and delicious food. It can seem tight but at the same time great to meet new people. Highly recommend!!"

Bistro Le Steak,40,Nice experience but don't expect to dine with locals.,"This is such a sweet, typical French looking restaurant. I found it on Tripadvisor and the downside to that is so has every other tourist, which does make it feel a bit less authentic - there were no French customers at all when I visited. But the food was still very nice. On a first visit to Paris it is a good way to experience some nice cuisine while you find out about some of the more hidden gems. Owners were friendly and prices very reasonable by Paris standards. I wish I could have visited a couple of decades ago to see how used to be."

Bistro Le Steak,40,Great little bistro,Don’t let the small crowded appearance put you off. The food was delicious. Typical French food and service ;) Very honest prices and all the items consumed by our group of 5 were very tasty and well made.

Bistro Le Steak,50,Charming with great food,"Took my mother here for her birthday dinner. A great menu and quaint restaurant. Try several dishes, it doesn't disappoint."

Bistro Le Steak,50,Delicious and great atmosphere,went here 10 years ago and loved it so I was excited to share it with friends. it did not disappoint. It is a small intimate restaurant run by a couple who interact with you and make you feel at home. The food is delicious.

Bistro Le Steak,40,Inviting and accommodating with great food,"Bistrot d’Henri is lovely and has a very local feeling, despite that about 80-90% of the diners the night we went were tourists. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious. We had a wonderfully garlicky escargot, a rocket and Parmesan salad that was far more interesting than it sounds, lamb chops and duck breast. The plats were simple preparations but very savory and flavorful. For dessert we split a tasty and well seasoned compote. The only drawback is the proximity of tables to each other but it’s likely a testament to management’s commitment to serve all the people who want to enjoy a good meal there."

Bistro Le Steak,40,French cuisine,"During our Paris trip, we wanted some authentic french cuisine. And we found it at Bistrot D’Henri! Food was good, the service quick (arguably too quick). It’s a cozy place, but too many tables for such a small restaurant. You almost sit on your neighbour’s lap."

Bistro Le Steak,50,A nice valentines dinner,"We found this restaurant in a blog about what to do in Paris. We made a reservation for valentines day. The restaurant was very small, but it was cozy and you had enough space to eat. I am 2 meters tall and i had space to eat. The women in charge of the restaurant was very nice. She smiled and talked to us when she had time. A lot og people came and asked for a table, but if you did not have a reservation then it is hard. Instead of rejecting people she recommended other restaurants for peopoe to try close by.    The food was very good. We tried the fresh goat cheese and marrowbone. A good start.    For the main course i wanted duck, but they did not have everything on the menu. This was totely fine because when the food arrived it was delicious. I got the slow cookes lamb and my partner got the bourguignon stew. I am very happy that i did not choose duck because the lamb was really good.    We shared a creme brulle for dessert and it tasted nice, and had a nice crunchy top.    Would recommend"

Bistro Le Steak,50,SPECTACULAR!,"We ate here on our first night in Paris and it did not disappoint! It's a small, cozy, casual, delicious and classic prepared options, a perfectly paired wine list, and fabulous artwork on the walls that add even more character to the experience. I can't wait to return to Paris to enjoy another meal here!!!"

Bistro Le Steak,10,Very disappointed,"Unfortunately, the service was very bad und unfriendly. We had to wait 15 minutes to order our food (the restaurant was empty).  The food was mediocre at best and did not resemble to the dishes presented in the photos.  I had the beouf bourgignon. The sauce was watery and it came with just one potato as a side. The potato was hard in the inside and not cooked through.. I enjoyed the coke though."

Bistro Le Steak,50,Go for it,"Wonderful tasty food, cosy atmosphere, very good value. Perfect for enjoying an evening with friends. Highly recommended"

Bistro Les Amis,50,GOOD FOR GLUTEN FREE DINERS,"REQUIRED A RESTAURANT THAT CATERED FOR STRICTLY GLUTEN FREE, NO MEAT REQUIREMENT. VERY SATISFIED WITH WHAT WAS OFFERED HERE. ONLY COMMENT - WOULD HAVE LIKED SLIGHTLY LESS BRIGHT LIGHTING AND SOME SOFT FURNISHINGS AS HARD SURFACES EXACERBATED NOISE LEVEL. ALL IN ALL THOUGH, EXCELLENT"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Lovely food and great service,"Visited for the early bird menu at lunchtime. Great value at £21 for 2 courses and £26 for 3 particularly as it includes homemade olive bread and seafood options often not included on set menus. We had the stacked crab which was delicious and the seafood money bag was fabulous. Lots of mixed seafood and the lobster sauce and frites were lovely. Service was efficient and friendly, restaurant was relaxed but well themed. A huge bonus that it's dog friendly as difficult to find good places to eat that aren't pubs. Highly recommended!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Seafood Money bag meets Beef Bourguinon.,"Yet again, amazing food produced by the chef Craig! Beautiful seafood money bag with to die for lobster bisque/sauce. My sister had the beef bourguignon and simply closed her eyes with the taste sensation! Definitely will be back for more. The staff are friendly and attentive, an altogether fantastic bistro!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,"Amazing place, people and food","I am so glad I gave this place a try. As soon as I walked in, I felt the warmth of the place and the people working in it. Due to the bad weather, it was relatively quiet, but that didn’t matter at all. The front of house staff were excellent. I think it was the owner who took our order, lovely guy with a real passion for food, telling us how he had collected the oysters just this morning and they didn’t disappoint. All of our starters and mains were superb, with home made warm bread served whilst we waited (not long at all) for the starters. Having lived in France, I can say that the food here tasted just as good as the best I had in Nantes. You just have to try it!! Can’t wait to see those guys again. I even got to thank the chef!  Chapeau guys!!! (Hat off to them)"

Bistro Les Amis,50,You have to come and try,I have to say this is the best restaurant we have been to in Skipton. Not only is the food second to none but the service from lizzie was great too. Pork belly is to die for!! Great response from the messaging service they offer too

Bistro Les Amis,50,A Superb lunch again at Le Bistro,"A most enjoyable lunch with friends, yet again!  I returned to Le Bistro again with two friends yesterday. The food was superb as always, (the Soup, Pork, Toad-in -the -Hole, Seafood Money bags followed by Creme Brulee & Lemon Curd Tart), well presented along with the freshly baked bread.  The service by the friendly & helpful staff, Alfie & Sophie,enhanced the experience.  It was a pleasure to meet Owner Fraser too.  Looking forward to going back again !soon!"

Bistro Les Amis,20,NOT GOOD,Went for Sunday lunch waited for 55mins for my dinner to come. when it did some of the food was cold and some was warm how can you wait so long for it to be like this very disappointed .

Bistro Les Amis,50,Fabulous evening,"Was in the venue for my husband’s 70th birthday. Service, food, drinks all fabulous would definitely be going back"

Bistro Les Amis,40,Ok really,I’ve given this 4 stars but 3.5 may be nearer    It was got and I would go again but somehow it should be better    The duck pate was good but only just worth the price    The dressed crab was also good but I’d not realised it was effectively a salad with the a bowl of tepid chips and at £19 seemed excessive    My wife’s food was similarly good but a bit pricey    The restaurant bills it’s self as a French bistro but it wasn’t that French.    I do recommend this place but it should be better    If the waiter could recommend a decent wine it would help    Maybe French ambience music and French look wait staff informs    It should be a French experience

Bistro Les Amis,30,What a difference....,"We visited Les Bistro des Amis again on 22nd August having last visited and reviewed as 5 star on the 29th June. We thought it would be perfect for my mums birthday lunch but oh my gosh, what a difference. The set menu is good value however how different it tastes when the service is slow and so your food is not hot. Yes, some of us could have started as soon as plates were put down in front of us, which eventually we did when we realised there was such a delay. We weren't a big party, there were six of us. Items were forgotten (we had been given a bread selection at the start of the meal on the 29th - nothing on the 22nd. We had even asked for bread and butter for one person but it didn't arrive. The cajun chicken caesar salad arrived, minus the cajun chicken and so it had to go back. We were constantly having to re ask for things ie one drink would be brought but not another. I can see on a previous review the manager has said that new staff were being trained however that shouldn't make this much of a difference to the customer. On our visit on the 29th, the young waiter was new to the role, possibly his first day, and was being trained by the manager but he was still attentive and polite and of course we made allowances but the service was still good and nothing like our last visit. Perhaps the newly trained staff aren't ready to be on their own yet? Either way, it is still a lovely venue. Assuming it's the same chefs, I know the food can be good as I've tasted it previously and just hope it'll soon be back to where it should be."

Bistro Les Amis,20,Good food. Shame about the service.,"Booked because of the high reviews, left disappointed. The food itself was good - nothing incredible, but all tasty enough. However, the service left an awful lot to be desired. A clearly inexperienced staff meant we were sat after our mains with dirty plates for almost 20 minutes, and no dessert menu. When bringing drinks over, old glasses weren’t taken. The water was free, and provided without asking, but came with two dirty glasses. I asked for the service charge to be removed at the end, something I don’t think I’ve ever done before. Disappointed, as the food was good."

Bistro Les Amis,30,Apparently we live in America now - 10% service charge!,"I have dined here many times over the years and usually enjoyed it, hence why we came back again. This time, we were not offered any bread for the table (we noted another table were given bread). I had previously really enjoyed the tasty bread so it was a shame not to receive any.    I had the French onion soup which was pretty good. My husband had the avocado starter and said it was very good.    Sadly, my main (roast Pork) was pretty bland and not very warm. I also had the lemon sorbet which wasn't very nice.    My biggest bug bear was the 10% service charge. There were only 2 of us, I understand restaurants charging service charge for large parties but this is ridiculous. The price for service should be included in the cost of the food. Hidden charges are not welcome at all when we are all living through a cost of living problem. If the service charge makes the meal more expensive, a judgement can be made whether or not to eat there. This is very sneaky in my opinion and for that reason, I will not be returning. Shame, restaurants can't afford to loose loyal customers. Thankfully, there are plenty of other places to eat out in Skipton."

Bistro Les Amis,30,Lovely food shame about the service,We have a professional team of chefs producing high quality food  only to be let down by the waiting staff  We booked for the early bird menu and were given the menu  When the bill came to be frank it was a mess and no acknowledgment of this menu  Two attempts finally put this right but causing a fair degree of aggravation and embarrassment in front of fellow diners  Life is hard enough for restauranteurs without this hassle and I’m afraid somebody needs to walk for this debacle

Bistro Les Amis,40,Great food.,"Great food, a little different from the usual . Enjoyed all our food and would return.  Bread for the table delicious and homemade , so why serve wrapped butter?  Same with fries, why serve frozen, disappointing.  Agree with other reviews re service charge, asked for it to be removed."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Fave place,"Called in today with my daughter for a spot of lunch! I got the goats cheese and tomato tart... absolutely delicious!!! My daughter got chicken gougons chips and sugar snap peas! I had to order a side portion of the sugar snap peas as they were absolutely delicious!!!!  I really do just love this place! food, staff, ambience and menu is just fabulous!!  Compliments to all x"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Great place for our lovely family lunch,"Very impressed with Le Bistro des Amis  on a previous visit and wanted to try  again. Good easy to use online booking  system, lovely welcome on arrival, clean  surroundings and lovely ambience  created with the cosy interior.  Good selection on the lunch / early bird  menu and everything we ordered was  great. Quality produce, cooked well and  nicely presented. Thank you to all for  making our family lunch so special. We  will definitely be back again!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Glad we ate here,We booked our table at a time to take advantage of the early bird menu. We loved the decor of the restaurant and were impressed with the choice of dishes. In fact it was difficult to choose. We were not disappointed with our three course meals; the portions were generous and the food excellent. The staff were helpful and attentive.

Bistro Les Amis,50,Go French in Skipton,"Great restaurant and it’s dog friendly too. The food and service is excellent and you really shouldn’t miss this restaurant.  It’s worth making a special trip here and even better if you don’t have to drive. The French Onion soup is delicious and you could almost cut it with a knife. It’s so full of juicy onions that have been cooked down and the cheese crouton on the top just adds to the scrumptiousness. We were both so full after this starter that we just had a dessert; the Eaton Mess and crème brûlée. These were both excellent the only improvement for us would be a little less cream.  Really good and friendly service staff and there were three dogs in at the same time and you would never have known it, lots of space."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Definitely recommend,"I went for lunch on Wednesday and the food was amazing, I had the French onion soup and the chicken liver pate both very tasty. The staff were great very attentive, French decor and music. Great atmosphere."

Bistro Les Amis,10,Don’t bother,Shockingly slow service (if you can call it that). No interaction unless waved over. Food was a ridiculous wait for overpriced rubbish. Don’t bother unless you’ve got a whole evening to waste.

Bistro Les Amis,50,Very good all round.,"Very tasty food. Well presented, and reasonably priced. Friendly efficient staff. Warm, comfortable, clean decor. Happy to recommend"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Fantastic,"After getting married, we had booked a table for 30 family and friends for the day after. The night before our wedding our table was cancelled.  Le bistro to the rescue. The manager Fraser put together a beautiful menu for our guests within 24 hours. The food was delicious and the service was brilliant. A huge thankyou to all involved you all made our weekend that extra bit special."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Just Superb,"we booked a table on recommendation from a cousin who lives in Skipton, I am glad we did.  Menus presented, drinks orders taken and wine ordered, by a friendly young lady.  We chose Scallops in Gruyere and Parma ham, followed by Seafood money bag and Duck breast. The food was out of this world, truly one of the best meals we have had in years.  As we were both nearly full, just enough room for a Creme Brulee and Lemon Tart. Again exquisite.  Service was perfect throughout, friendly knowledgeable waitresses, attentive without being intrusive.  We will definitely return next time we are in Skipton"

Bistro Les Amis,50,"Excellent lunch, highly recommend.","A wonderful lunch. The food was simple (we just had baguettes with fries) but SO well executed, with clearly a lot of skill. The decor is lovely, the staff were so sweet and we will certainly be back."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Highly recommend excellent food,"Went to le bistro on Sunday for a family meal for our dad's birthday / fathers day, we all had a Fabulous day the staff where very friendly and welcoming and the service was excellent, and as for the food we all was on complete agreement that it was amazing and so tasty hats off to the chefs.  we all will definitely be returning 😊😊😊👍👍👍👌👌👌"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Absolutely delicious!!!!!,"My father in law chose Le Bistro for his 75th Birthday Meal, aswell as taking my own dad for father's Day! after them waiting patiently for a member of our family to arrive, we then ordered!!  Every single person enjoyed their food!! My dad (who I feel can be a little fussy) commented how tasty it was and how delicious it was when he went a couple of weeks back! Definitely a compliment! Service was excellent and food exceptional!!  I have personally been here a few times,it never disappoints ,it is one of my favourite places to dine the patè is a favourite of mine.  Thank you very much! Highly Recommend and we will be returning!!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,wow!,"Came here the other day for some lunch with my friend and wow! Staff where very nice and welcoming and the food was amazing. I got the french onion soup, absolutely delicious, and then i had the toad in the hole which was absolutely delicious I really made a great choice in what to get. Will definitely be back!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,brill birthday dinner,"came here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend, it was so lovely and the staff (even though it was busy) managed to make it so special.  I had the pate to start and as always it was perfect while my partner had the scallops. honestly amazing he had no complaints.  for mains, I had the chicken and it was amazing, so moist and he had the toad in the hole, amazing.  we will definitely be back and we definitely recommend."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Fabulous food A* service!,"Myself and my family had such a great time here on Sunday 18th June for Fathers Day.. Great food, fabulous service… very highly recommend A***** Many many Thanks Louise x"

Bistro Les Amis,20,Poor,"Really disappointed. Took some work colleagues for a mid week dinner . One of the party ordered toad in the hole to then be told just before starters came out that they had run out of Yorkshire pudding! It’s egg , flour and milk, really !! I ordered cured ham with melon . It came with a small over cooked piece of ham that disintegrated on my plate . When I asked where the cured ham was I was told they had run out and was offered boiled ham as a replacement . For the prices being charged it was not good enough I’m sorry to say. We did get an pint of beer thrown onto the table with no explanation but can only assume it was due to the food mess. Also adding the 10% tip without any apologies at the end summed up the experience and poor overall service ."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Fantastic!,Fantastic food - starters mains & desserts were delicious. On holiday in the area and booked online - all 4 of us loved it.

Bistro Les Amis,50,Lunch celebration 🍾 well worth it.,"Last minute choice for lunch. WOW!! Food was amazing, service fab, the owner was so lovely, shame l could not get the soup recipe. This is one eateri you will be back to again and again . A Must visit when in Skipton."

Bistro Les Amis,50,"Found, at last............","Food was excellent & well worth waiting for ( a bit longer than expected). Service was polite & attentive. Visit Skipton every now & then but hadn't found somewhere to eat that we'd go back to next time. We have now! Not as expensive as you'd think, too. I'm allowed one gripe (apparently): Deep red walls & black stairs? Thought that we'd fallen into an Edgar Allen Poe set! Brighten it up FGS."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Definitely worth a visit,"We had the ""early bird menu"", £23.00 plus service charge, absolutely fantastic quality and value for money.    The food, the different tastes, a shear delight. I have certain allergies, the chef changed a sauce for me.    The ambience, very French, the service, excellent. We were absolutely not rushed, neither hurried, or left too long, excellent.    Absolutely stunning, definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."

Bistro Les Amis,50,5* dinner,Me and a friend came for dinner a few evenings ago! The food is absolutely superb and the staff are so so friendly and attentive! 10/10 definitely recommend

Bistro Les Amis,30,Excellent food…slow service,The food here was excellent as always - really tasty and good portion sizes. The menu had a good selection and was reasonably priced.    Unfortunately on this visit we were let down by very slow service despite the restaurant not being busy. Plates weren’t cleared for ages after finishing and there was a lack of attention in respect of drinks & desserts. This is a shame as the service is normally very good here.    We then had a service charge added to the bill of 10% - if a service charge is to be added then the service needs to be consistently good.

Bistro Les Amis,50,Great tasty food.,"Amazing food, very generous portions and lovely atmosphere and good value for early evening menu. We will.return next time visiting Skipton."

Bistro Les Amis,30,"A little disappointing, given the ratings","We were looking forward to this a lot, based on reviews, but of our 4 nights eating out in the area (a local pub, a country house hotel, an Italian restaurant) this was our least favourite. Little sign of Frenchness in decor, and the menu was odd - French, British, Italian (Russian?)    The food was fine, but nothing special. The vegetables were very oily, lemon tart not very tangy. Service was friendly and willing but not very professional.    And I really do hate it when restaurants add a service charge without saying so."

Bistro Les Amis,50,A wonderful & authentic French Bistro.,"Wonderful food & a lovely ambience. Good selection of well presented & good portions of tasty food. The staff are friendly & the Restaurant is perfect for Friends, Couples & Families. I would highly recommend this place & we would definitely go again."

Bistro Les Amis,20,Shame waste of a good walk,"Firstly take in that sign outside advertising Real ales , there isn't any !!  The two stars are for the starter crab.and the wine , but the Sunday lunch is poor ""The Sunday Lunch"" was just warm, overdone veg soaked in butter, Yorkshire pudding that tasted like the box they came in and the pork was under cooked with traces of blood, out of the four of us nobody said it was enjoyable, we all go out as a group nearly every Sunday for a good walk and a Sunday lunch and we all have favourites, unfortunately it won't be here."

Bistro Les Amis,50,Amazing food,"Some of the best French food we have had.  The seafood money bag was out of this world, as was the beef bourguignon. The only room for improvement is to try and make the space / atmosphere a bit more intimate. We were sat on a table really close to another couple which was quite awkward especially since the music was really low you could hardly hear it, so we could hear every word the other couple were saying and vice versa so we couldn’t relax"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Indulgent lunch,"My Dad and I always love a visit here, delayed a fortnight this time, due to train strikes. The baked Queenie scallops were as sinful as ever and boeuf bourginon was a hearty feast. Friendly and efficient service from the team. There was a small misunderstanding with the drinks but it was resolved promptly and with a smile. Plenty of wine by the glass and the coffee is excellent too. I only wish that it was not so far away from us!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Skiptons hidden gem!,"A hidden gem, the very best Sunday dinner available. Great food and staff, can’t wait to return!! 12 out of 10👍🏻"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Highly recommend for friendly service and great food,"Very friendly atmosphere with great service and excellent tasty and substantial dishes. A good selection for starters and mains. Overall, good value for quality food!"

Bistro Les Amis,50,Superb!,"Superb food, excellent and welcoming staff. Can’t recommend highly enough. Lovely atmosphere. The seafood money bag, cottage pie and toad in the hole were all excellent and my friends and I are looking forward to a return visit!"

Bouley,50,Excellent choice would highly recommend.,"The food was excellent and we allowed our waiter to make most food and wine at pairings, and he did an amazing job. The beef cheek was the star of the show, with a beautiful Demi glacé and a hint of ginger in the creamy potatoes."

Bouley,50,"Very good brunch, excellent value.","We had brunch there. The choices were limited, but food was excellent. It was also good value, really not expensive for the quality food provided."

Bouley,40,"Immerse yourself in fresh, unique flavors","We ventured in for lunch and made reservations for dinner the following evening. I had lichen with my starter and lament there is little chance of having it again. I would gladly eat the lichen, crunchy and slightly sweet, rather than potato chips. The rest of the meal had other boreal flavors integrated, which made the entire experience intriguing and flavorful. If we lived in Quebec it would become a regular haunt."

Bouley,50,This place is special,"This food is both innovative and wonderful. Presentation is excellent. Service excellent. Menu selection is fairly extensive, and the quality excellent."

Bouley,50,Best onion soup …. EVER,"The plan was to go to chez Boulay to try the onion soup. Had the soup, a drink, and knew we had to go back. Returned for dinner. Wonderful experience. Service terrific. I had a delicious lamb plate, we also had beautiful arctic char. Dessert was chomeur pudding, a type of bread pudding and the seabuckthorn meringue pie. If you visit Quebec City, treat yourself, dine at Chez Boulay."

Bouley,50,Unique Chef Inspired menu and Quebec experience.,"Classy and unique menu, inspired by chefs. A light fish dish is extremely tasty. The staff was very pleasant and helpful."

Bouley,50,Terrific meal in the heart of Old Quebec,"This is a bustling restaurant where food is king. We were two couples who were fortunate enough to be seated where I could see the prep station at the open kitchen. Their work was amazing. There is a large and busy (but well organized) staff, very efficient and helpful. Nothing detracts from the food. I started with an interesting baratta and tomato dish where both the cheese and tomatoes were very fresh! My main was a duo of blood sausages, very tasty and not overly strong. The others in my party started with an outstanding leek and apple soup and a modified French onion soup with a light whipped cheese and a creamy broth; they all loved their choices. Their mains were walleye and arctic char, also perfectly done. The wine list has good variety at good price points. All in all, one outstanding meal for all four of us!! This is a must try!"

Bouley,50,Go for lunch. Less expensive but just as good.,"We went there for lunch, when the prices were far more reasonable, and it was a truly amazing meal. The menu is limited, but that doesn’t matter because everything was astounding. I am not a vegetarian, but if I had the opportunity to eat what they created for me, I could easily become one, however, the beef cheeks also looked amazing. The service was stellar and the ambience amazing."

Bouley,40,"A fun, interesing take on local, forest based food.","Really well done, unassuming, and welcoming even though they have been there for years and are in the middle of the tourist area. Food was clearly fresh, imaginative, and not overly priced."

Bouley,50,Wonderful Evening,From start to finish this was a wonderful dining experience. The service was perfectly paced… no rush… and the food was exceptional. Every dish was perfectly prepared. The wine list offers bottles from all areas of the world. We rank this as one of the best meals we have experienced in our travels and our server was knowledgeable of the menu and very helpful with our choices.

Bouley,50,High-End customer service,"September 30th I were calling on phone to Australasia from another continent cos I had no opportunity to write an e-mail. This call was extremely important to me cos I`m in charge of preparing a birthday party for my boss .  I was so excited by an amazing customer phone service. The recepcionist was polite and considerate. I`ve been wondering about some details in the menu as there are allergic and vegetarian people among us. It`s suprisingly difficult to have a intercontinental phone conversation without any difficulties, still the receptionist provided all details that dramatically enhanced and sped up my preparing process.  Massive thanks to your amazing customer service!"

Bouley,50,Best meal of our trip!,"One of the best meals we had in Quebec City! Very Celiac Disease friendly - which was my biggest concern. The restaurant was packed, our server was very busy, but still treated us like we were his only customer. Our meal was perfect in every way. This chef knows how to blend flavors uniquely and deliciously. I would go back again and again! A wonderful meal in a perfect atmosphere. Don't miss eating here!"

Bouley,50,Memorable Meal - Excellent Service,"We were very excited to get a reservation here and the meal was in keeping with all the great reviews. The evening we dined it was pouring outside, but the restaurant was full. We started with the cheese plate and enjoyed it with sauvignon blanc wine. I had the chicken breast on fresh corn with crispy polenta and it was very flavorful. My husband had the poached walleye and he said it was perfect. We didn't have dessert as we were worn out from sightseeing, but I'm sure it would have been great. Highly recommend this restaurant."

Bouley,50,PERFECTION,"We ended up coming here upon arrival  In Quebec City and we were looking for someplace we could walk to from our Airbnb. We came here after we had gone to another restaurant and found it closed up. This was a lucky find. The restaurant was full, but we were seated in the annex, which was quieter and just lovely. it’s a small menu but everything on it is top notch. Everything is super fresh.  We had the French onion soup, which was outstanding, and a tomato salad with Burrata for appetizers.    I had the halibut and it was cooked perfectly with a light hollandaise sauce and served over cooked fennel. The combination was delicious. My husband had bison that was super tender , with some french fries.  The dessert menu looked wonderful, but we decided to skip dessert tonight.  This is definitely a restaurant worth going to. Different flavors than you might normally find. Everything made with fresh herbs and spices. Our waiter was super nice and friendly and helpful. He spoke English with us. This place is a gem. Be sure to call For a reservation before you go because it is very popular ."

Bouley,30,Disappointing--mediocre food.,"Very disappointing. The food was mediocre--the soup, fish, pasta. This was our big splurge in the city, and it left me in a terrible mood. Perhaps the meat dishes are better. I was interested in dessert but after our entrees, we weren't willing to risk it."

Bouley,50,excellent food and atmosphere,very nice dinner sitting outside Service slow but everything else good .Arctic char terrific. Steak/frites very good. For dessert would try something else beside the ice cream sandwich Fairly Pricey but worth it overall. Will be back next time in QC.great location too

Bouley,50,Yummy dinner in Quebec City! Beautiful old town?,"Beautifully plated, delicious and uniquely presented! I had the salmon appetizer and the chicken Main corn with fresh corn and yummy fried polenta."

Bouley,50,Simply marvelous,"I wanted to give a great present to my girlfriend and she mentionned a few times that she had lunch at this place and she loved it. So to hit a homerun I invited here for dinner on her birthday. Well quite a surprise for me! ( never been there before) It is a exceptionnal place to go, meal, atmosphere, service, beverages everything was just great. Price were very readonnable for the quality and quantity in your plate. I highly recommand this place. It s a taste of heaven 😋😉"

Bouley,50,Great meal,"We had a great meal here. Our waiter was very attentive. We found different entrees here that were very good. We highly recommend that you eat here,"

Cafe Gitane,30,Our New York Trip,"Great little place to have brunch. The wait is not too long and there is seating outside as well. Inside is small, enough for about 10 tables. There’s also seating at the bar. We sat inside and our wait for our food was not that long.  The cappuccinos were a bit light, that is if you are used to strong coffee.  The meals were delicious, the waffle topped with berries and the salmon, potatoes and egg dish were great.  The double espresso was very watery."

Cafe Gitane,30,"Good service, Coffee/Croissant OK",I stopped for a croissant and coffee early morning. It was really pleasant sit outside and watch the people strolling by while enjoying the cafes offerings. All in all the coffee and pastry were fine without being outstanding. Service was friendly and well judged.

Cafe Gitane,50,"During my trip to New York,","During my trip to New York, every morning I went shopping and in the afternoons I went more to visit the city. I was able to visit Central Park which is New York’s largest park, the Empire state building which is one of the largest building.  I was able to visit Central Park which is the largest New Park in the city as well as many museums such as the Solomon R Museum Guggenhein which has me much more. I ate every lunch in different fast food tasted what was hot dog, macdo, kfc... And in the evenings I went to eat in the most famous restaurants in New York. And also visit the status of freedom that I unfortunately could not see because of my short stay."

Cafe Gitane,10,Granola without granola & French service,"We went in here for a late breakfast. My wife noticed on the menu outside they had fresh granola, which is what she fancied. We both ordered the bowl of fresh granola but what we were served was a load of yoghurt, a mix of fresh fruit, chaotically put on the yoghurt and a very thin, hardly to be found, fresh granola. It's hard to comment on the quality as there was so little. We complained about it and got a French shrug, which meant so much as: 'take it or leave it'. We paid and left. While leaving we heard the table behind us make the same complaint about the non present granola, which made us realize, it wasn't us."

Cafe Gitane,50,Original couscous,I had the couscous.is so original and so tasty. The service is fast perfect when you are in rush even when its busy. Nice place I recommend

Cafe Gitane,50,"Great experience, tasty food, good service","Great little french cafe. The food here is really great. Vegetables are fresh, the serving is beautiful and the service is friendly and professional."

Cafe Gitane,40,Fresh new age salad,"Quick salad lunch at this place, didn’t disappoint. Coffee was surprisingly good too, not amazing but definitely drinkable. Ok service"

Cafe Gitane,40,great coffee!,"Honestly, this is the kind of place that makes you love New York. The kind of French restaurant that I would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else (maybe even France!) on a crowded street where you can sip a coffee on the sidewalk and watch the world go by. Not exceptional but definitely solid food in a place that has great atmosphere especially in the summer. Was the perfect way to start my day in SoHo/LES"

Cafe Gitane,20,High hopes but disappointing experience with service and food,"I'm a local who has walked by this restaurant many times with high expectations. Our party of five arrived on a Tuesday night open minded and expecting a great night. We were disappointed in the service and let down by the food. We were treating a friend and she could not hide her disappointment. There was ONE waitress (who was new on the job) for the entire restaurant; she was very pleasant but could not manage the work load. Three guys behind the bar could not help with filling water and clearing plates?? We ordered 2 starters for the table that were dry and unappetizing. Our entrees were flavorful and we enjoyed them, but were more suitable for a lunch or brunch menu than dinner. So many great choices within a 5 minute walk..... I suggest that you walk by this one unless the management changes."

Cafe Gitane,50,A tarot divination,"We enjoy being in SoHo just to explore alternative life style! This visit wasn’t different: just browsing around we ended up at this small and attractive cafe restaurant. I’ve added the restaurant as a great adjective to this cafe, because the menu was wider than a regular place; also because we enjoyed our sandwich with guacamole and eggs, plus the cheese plate order, to be complemented with a nice wine. It was 11:30, and our brunch was perfect. Try it! No regret!"

Cafe Gitane,40,Lunch outside on a beautiful spring day,"My wife and I were walking through this soho/noho neighborhood and stopped at one of our favorite cafes. We’ve eaten here many time before, and brought friends as well. But we hadn’t been back in a while. Nothing has changed. Food is great and reasonably priced. Service was gracious and efficient. The weather was great, so we dined outdoors and watched the world go by. Highly recommended."

Cafe Gitane,50,Our favorite café for lunch!,We have not been back to NYC in 7 years. We were so happy to see that nothing has changed at Café Gitane during our absence. The vegetarian small plates and salads are as flavorful and delicious as we remembered.

Cafe Gitane,40,Lunch on Mott,"The little hidden gem on Mott delivers a very good meal in a nice environment. The bar is a great place to watch the chefs work their magic. We had a few drinks at the bar while waiting for a party member.    Once st our table we ordered the egg on a French baguette, the veggie burger and the Moroccan cous cous. Everything was excellent and very filling."

Cafe Gitane,50,Super cute,"Love this little gem. I have been many times, with friends and family. Love the simple decor and the food, the cous cous is a must!"

Cafe Gitane,50,Great place to stop by for good wine and good food,"I run accidentally in this place and I found a small and nice place, very good french wines, good food for a reasonable price and very kind people that works there. Didn’t have a big proper dinner just some appetizers and wine but I ended up very satisfied. Recommended if you are looking for something easy but good. Enjoy"

Cafe Gitane,30,Breakfast!,I was staying in Nolita so decided to try breakfast at Cafe Gitane. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and some coffee. Opens at 8:30 am.

Cafe Gitane,50,My favour lunch restaurant in Soho/ Nolita,"I love this boho organic restaurant and in every visit to NYC , I will have lunch there while shopping Soho Service is amazing , crowd too and the food delicious"

Cafe Gitane,40,Great Couscous,The couscous was very good and I ordered the goat cheese appetizer and mixed it in with bites. I ordered on an app and had it delivered so did not get to experience the actual restaurant but the food was great.

Cafe Gitane,50,Wonderful breakfast,"Great food, coffee and selection of breads! Family of 4, it was a tight squeeze in the restaurant but well worth it!"

Cafe Gitane,50,Delicious couscous!,Small bistro style restaurant with delicious food. Couscous was very good! Prices are fair. I’ll be back.

Cafe Gitane,50,Great place!,"This is a calm place, with warm and welcoming staff. The atmosphere and food was very nice. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a calm, fast, and good breakfast. (Our food came very quickly)"

Cafe Gitane,40,Cool little cheap eatery serving wicked cous cous,"Fantastic little simple cafe serving Moroccan inspired food. Very friendly service, and a happening vibe. Very good value ( cheap ) and delicious!"

Cafe Gitane,50,Relaxed friendly cafe with excellent food and wine,Completely stress free cafe with terrific food and wines. Great atmosphere and professional wait staff. Couscous are recommnded!

Cafe Gitane,50,Perfect !,"It was perfect, the dish was excellent very quick serbes, the place is beautiful and warm. The Best restaurant from nyc"

Cafe Gitane,50,Nice place with great food,I had late breakfast here and I really enjoyed it. It was tasty and the staff is very nice. This place reminded me of France.

Cafe Gitane,50,Nice place,We went there for lunch with friends .. we really enjoyed our foods .!! Delicious.!! Nice staff.! Great atmosphere

Cafe Gitane,40,Top shelf food,"Perfect place for vegetarian people, cosy cancel light diner in an relaxing environment. A lot of courses are made live, so if you get the Chance, sit by the bar."

Cafe Gitane,50,What a discovery,"French café in a French setting. Very healthy meals for under 20$. We chose a seat at the bar/open kitchen and it was amazing. All fresh products and my banana tart was made in front of me, so not just store bought."

Cafe Gitane,30,Nice place cool design but the staff not really friendly,We heard about the place and really liked the idea of the coffee shop but was disappointed with the attitude of the staff

Cafe Gitane,50,A Nolita Classic: it doesn't disappoint!,Great food - great value for money - very cozy - no frills! Try the watermelon mimosa and the avocado toast (without egg)! Love that place and always visit it when in NYC!

Cafe Gitane,50,A well kept secret!,I almost don't want to say too much about this spot as I lov the fact it is discreet and frequented by locals rather than tourists. If I am in the neighbourhood I always pop in for a coffee and I really love it here.

Cafe Gitane,50,Breakfast,We loved the fruity breakfast and the frenchy-marroc environment. Style done in perfection regarding tailored details as European change plates (not sure if right wording).

Cafe Gitane,50,Fab NYE Eatery,Such a fantastic little gem - it may not look like much but it packs a punch for good value - tasty eating. Lovely NYC vibe without NYC prices!

CamaJe,50,Great atmosphere,"It was a really great experience loved it would definitely go back. The food and wine was amazing, and they were very accommodating."

CamaJe,50,Delicious meal,"Excellent restaurant. The French Lentil salad (mixed greens, beets, herbed goat cheese), the bouillabaisse and the dense, rich flourless chocolate cake are all delicious. The service is attentive."

CamaJe,40,Nice for a small snack and a glass of wine,"On our nice stroll through the area, we decided to stop at this place.    At first mainly due to the availability to sit outside and be able to smoke while enjoying the street pictures and the buzz in the area.    We ordered a few glass of wine and some of the smaller dishes - they had a platter with pate, duck and goat cheese, which all can be recommended.    Also had to try the escargots - Not the best tried, but for the place I think as expected.    The service was great and our waiter always very observe on us..    Free wifi for the interested.    Being from Europe, we felt like true local New York´ers for a few hours:)"

CamaJe,50,"Camaje: Great Service, Good Food","My wife and I had a great experience at Camaje. Our waitress, Gretchen, is a gem. Her salary should be doubled! She went out of her way to make our dinner an experience. I had the evening special which was breast of duck which was excellent. My wife had mussels which were also excellent. I highly recommend Camaje. Thanks for such an enjoyable evening."

CamaJe,30,"Great overall experience, food lacking","I went with a friend as we'd both read and heard about dining in the dark and were extremely interested.    I'd rate it most favorably for the experience itself--I wont knock that one bit! The service while there was excellent! Since you are blindfolded your senses of smell and taste are to be heightened.    There was a ""crunch"" start which was ok. Then was the appetizer which was shrimp with a sweet corn type of sauce with tomatoes. There was one shrimp so kind of skimpy.    There was then the main which seemed a bit basic, and a dessert which was pretty tasty but again I was expecting a bit more due to the cost of the meal itself.    There was liquor paired throughout which was a nice touch but I'd recommend going primarily for the experience itself, not the food. Not to spoil it for anyone but the most fun I had there was more so for the sound and participation experience vs. the food itself.    I think it's definitely worth going at least once, especially for a special occasion since it's out of the norm."

CamaJe,50,Fantastic!,"Me and my boyfriend wanted a different experience in New York! So we ended up booking a blindfolded dinner in the dark, that turned out to be the right thing to do! Ernest and Abby and all of the other nice people leading us throughout the evening (to the bathroom, tablesettings and our chairs) was seriously the best! Thank you guys for having us! See you next time //Robin and Linnea from sweden"

CamaJe,40,Try the duck!,"This small cafe has wonderful food. Because of its size, you should make a reservation ahead of time. The staff is warm and friendly. The restaurant is in the Village in a great location, and has a nice atmosphere. We had the duck, which was delicious and not at all fatty. We went with a Groupon. Be aware that they have special dinners every so often where people are blindfolded and eat in the dark so as not to be distracted from the taste of the food. We never went to those, and also if you have a Groupon you can not use it for that. So, call ahead so you won't be disappointed."

CamaJe,40,Nice Brunch Spot,"Great brunch spot close to the village in NYC. The onion soup wasn't good :( , however everything else was great. The serve was very generous with champagne for the mimosas. The restaurant is kind of small so if you are going with a large group call in advance. Perfect for a group of 4 or couples intimate date."

CamaJe,50,Unique experience,"My husband and I signed up for the blind folded dinner experience and didn't regret it.    We were led in blindfolded so we couldn't see what the restaurant looked until the end. The appetizer was a delicious shrimp salad, entree was pork (I thought it was chicken!) and the dessert was a grape tart (I thought it was blueberry tart).    We really enjoyed the experience I recommend doing this at least once."

CamaJe,40,Dinner in the Dark,"The experience of eating an entire meal blindfolded was unique. Camaje has been hosting this event for 12 years and they really have the mechanics down well. The servers were attentive and very clear on their instructions throughout the meal. The menu was carefully planned so that the food required no cutting (thank God) and there were no drippy sauces. I found myself using my left hand to get a sense of where the food was on my plate and to guide food onto my fork - why not, everyone was blindfolded? The room was very loud to the point where I just didn't want to compete to be heard. It would have been fine for couples to converse but there were a few larger groups that were yelling across their tables to talk over other guests. After the first hour I really wanted to rip my blindfold off because it was a bit uncomfortable and it rested on the bridge of my nose, partially obstructing my sense of smell (particularly while trying to get the bouquet of the wines). I found myself readjusting the fit and position of the mask throughout the meal. The food was tasty, although not plentiful - for $95/person I expected a more substantial meal. The owner and chef, Abby Hitchcock, is VERY pleasant and took time at the end to ""reveal"" details and ingredients of the menu. Overall it was an interesting and worthwhile experience."

CamaJe,30,Dinner in the dark was sparse,"For an interesting night out, why not eat dinner blindfolded? Great concept, lotsa fun. However at Camaje Bistro, eating in the dark still left u hungry. I found myself grabbing a slice of pizza after dinner. Go for the fun of it, not for the meal"

CamaJe,30,Dinner in the Dark at Camaje,"Well we have a group of friends and for everyones birthday we try to embark on a new experience hence Dinner in the Dark at Camaje. Overall a unique experience and a lot of fun the first hour but after that I was itching literally to get my blindfold off. The concept is to be completely blind to whatever you are eating so that you can experience the sounds, tastes, and textures around you without judging with your eyes. While waiting outside I was reading the menu and was eagerly anticipating what my dinner would consist of. Was hoping to have something similar to what I was reading but that was not the case. All courses were paired with wine which was all quite good however the food up until dessert was not what was expected. The first bite was a crunchy garlic crostini. Served for the sound effect it was fine however it was impossible to bite into. Just a little too crunchy for me. The second course was a celery root soup served room temperature and tasted right on the mark like a bunch of celery. The main course was a pork tenderloin with cumin, coriander etc so decidedly tasted like curry served with polenta and asparagus. Not a polenta fan and definitely not a curry fan so at this point had barely eaten. Never found the asparagus on my plate but heard they were quite good. Dessert was fabulous but at that point we were starving so the chocolate cake with raspberries and ice cream was gobbled up. Our party of 6 all had the same feeling. A+ for creativity and uniqueness but for the $95 price ticket per person food should have definitely been more upscale and more mainstream in terms of flavor profile. Wines were enjoyed by some but not by others. Loved the concept and was hoping for more in the food but sadly failed in that department. Servers were attentive to our needs even if a little testy at times. I guess with 30 + diners blindfolded, loud and demanding thats to be expected."

CamaJe,50,Excellent,Food was delicious. Service was outstanding. Small and quiet place. Will definitely return when we are in the city again.

CamaJe,40,Good food. Good Service. Cozy and Relaxed Dining.,"1/2 block away from the hustle and bustle of Bleeker & McDougal, this cozy little restaurant has good food and service. They often have a Groupon offer so look and see if they do and get an even better deal."

CamaJe,50,Very creative approach and great experience,"Camaje has been established for a long time and has succeeded in a very competitive neighborhood with a discerning clientele. Our visit just after Christmas 2016 was a very pleasant experience. Comfortable set-up is allied to an excellent cocktail/wine list and menu, which has a French/American emphasis. My (soup) appetiser was outstanding and our mains (lamb/fish) were perfectly prepared and attractively presented. We will definitely be returning."

CamaJe,40,Great food and Cozy!,"As soon as you walk in you are hit with a welcoming and interesting space. Menu was unique and the food fresh and awesome. Our waiter was lovely and very accommodating. Food took forever to come out but if you are dining with great friends and family or the love of your life and you have the time, you won't notice. Happy dining!!"

CamaJe,50,Lovely Little restaurant,"Best duck I've ever had. Also, the escargot appetizer is succulent and well-prepared. All the food, in fact, including amazing desserts, thrilled. Small, intimate venue. Courteous staff. A winner."

CamaJe,20,The Most Awful Service,"We are 5 friends who take each other out for our birthdays for 30-35 years now. Last night was special because not only was it a birthday celebration, but the honoree is moving far away tomorrow. We chose this charming small bistro because the reviews were generally good and the menu looked terrific. It was a huge disappointment. Apparently, the bartender didn't show up, but rather than just suggesting that we not order their signature drinks, they attempted to make due with a waitress who, as it turned out, was challenged in that role, too. A half hour after ordering our drinks, my dirty martini arrived -- by itself, sadly warm, and a finger short of the top of the glass. Next came warm white wine, followed slowly by two other drinks. The 5th drink arrived an hour after we arrived, barely filling a quarter of its glass and also warm. So much for a celebratory toast. (FYI, we were the only table being served, as they had most of the place taken up by a cooking class. Odd on a Saturday night. Table of 2 came in after we had our drinks.) Two escargot appetizers were very disappointing -- served on a flat plate with barely any butter or garlic -- barely-moist. The pumpkin soup and pesto crostini were tasty. The bread came at the same time, but no butter or oil, which we had to ask for more than once. Main dishes were tasty -- Loup de Mer (somewhat dry lentils), hangar steak and lamb tangine. The drink situation remained dreadful, even when we switched to simpler options. The banoffee pie was wonderful, but the flowerless chocolate cake, recommended in place of the creme brûlée the honoree wanted, was completely overpowered by the delicious raspberry sorbet. Finally, the check went through 4 iterations before it was right. I assume it was an off-night, but really, there was a serious lack of ability to cope professionally with a situation that must not be that rare in the restaurant business. We did our best not to let it ruin our evening, but it was a much less than festive outcome. I add that there were only 7 dining customers in the restaurant."

CamaJe,30,"""Hits"" and ""Misses""","I don't like giving a negative review, however, just like the current World Series, there were a few ""Hits"" & ""Misses"" for my recent dining experience on Friday evening 10/28 at Camaje Bistro, a tiny & cozy French restaurant in the West Village. After reading many positive reviews, I decided to take out Steve for a Birthday celebration.  Here is a list of the many ""Hits"" & ""Misses"":  Service:  Hit (Single): Waiter was very friendly & knowledgeable about items on the menu. He took great delight in my dinner choices.  Miss (Strike): Very very slow service. It shouldn't take over a half hour between courses to be served, especially when the restaurant is not that crowded. I don't know if this was due to a slow chef or if the only waiter that night was overwhelmed.  Food:  Hit (Double): Steve enjoyed the Garlic Shrimp appetizer. He really liked the confit of carrot & fennel under the shrimp.  I also thought my Duck entree was prepared perfectly - medium rare & tender! Steve also liked the Lamb Tajine for his entree.  Miss (Foul Ball): Steve & I did not like the Escargot appetizer.  Although the portion size was ample, the Escargot totally lacked any seasoning or flavor. I have had this dish many times & love lapping up the the Garlic - Parsely Butter sauce with my bread.This version, however, was missing this delectable sauce.  Although I liked the preparation of my Duck entree, I didn't like the bitter greens & tart pomegranate sauce that accompanied it.  Steve, also thought that the Cous Cous in his Lamb Tagine was overwhelmed & drowned by too much sauce.  Dessert:  Hit & Miss: Steve greatly enjoyed the Banoffee Pie. I thought that it was just okay. Also, since I mentioned that it was a special Birthday occasion, you would think that the waiter would have brought either an extra dessert or free glass of wine.  All in all, no ""Home Run"" for this restaurant!"

CamaJe,10,This place is a mess!,The kitchen is a mess. The food comes out room temperature after 3 hours of waiting. I am not sure what all the raves are about this place. The escargot entree was just butter but not escargot as they should be. At 630 when this Dinner began -- they had already run out of the lamb and one of the apps.    The wait is interminable .. and the dessert was something I think my daughter made in second grade. The entire restaurant was waiting hours for their meals.    With all the good restaurants ... not sure why anyone would give this a second chance.

CamaJe,10,The Worse Restaurant,"***A really tiny place, with a bar and small tables that wouldn’t seat 15. The menu was limited (which would be fine if the food were good), but we still tried to have a good time. First served: stale tiny slices of bread--all crust--served with some butter substitute. After sharing 5 tiny shrimp for two, I had about 2 oz of fish, one slice of a cucumber-like vegetable overcooked and drowned in syrup, and about 1 tablespoon of some rice. The blueberry cake desert--for two--could be consumed in a total of 4 small bites.    It is one of the most unattractive, tho just redecorated, we'd ever seen and so tiny that you could hear everyone's conversation (2 other couples were there) . I had a cheap, sweet Proseco, in addition. Of course we left a nice tip for a  pathetic, too-too sweet, over-worked waiter and frustrating dinner of $55.    My husband and I work hard for our money and it's nothing less than infuriating to see it thrown into the trash. When we left, around 8:30, we noticed how all the restaurants in the area were overflowing with people. We left 2 behind (and perhaps some at a table out doors).    Perhaps they dislike Groupon customers. They certainly don't like good food or they'd prepare something at least fair.    After we left, we went out for dinner. (FYI: We are both quite slim and require relatively little  food to be celebratory.)"

Casimir,50,Great Paris Bistro,"This restaurant is a great spot close to Gare Du Nord for those wanting an authentic Paris Bistro experience. The informal atmosphere made it even more appealing. I ordered the beef in a red wine sauce and was blown away. The dish was cooked to perfection and was exactly what I was after during my one night in Paris. Service was great, although my lack of French was a little embarrassing, but the staff spoke great English which saved my blushes. It was shame I was dining solo and will definitely come again in the future, with my wife or with a larger group."

Casimir,50,A gorgeous evening meal.,"I came here for a birthday dinner for my mum with her and my sister. We booked for an evening meal at 8pm, the restaurant was quite quiet when we arrived but packed when we left. Seemingly mostly with locals, which is always a good sign!  The service was very friendly, the waiter managed much better English than our terrible French and when I mentioned that it was my mum’s birthday he served her dessert with two candles in! :-)  The meal itself was gorgeous. Mum and I both had beef and my sister lemon sole. For dessert I had the restaurant’s own Paris Brest, which was AMAZING and my mum and sister had fresh figs with lychee and hibiscus mousse, which my mum said was the best dessert she’d had in years.  All in all a lovely experience at a lovely cosy French restaurant which I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend."

Casimir,20,Bland and expensive,As and ex chef I was expecting big things but I was very disappointed. The waitress was lovely and the bottle of wine was good but the food was so bland .we had the fish with cream sauce mushrooms and spinage .for 30 euros a plate I would expect some flavour but there was none .and to top it off we were rushed out and not even a thanks and goodbye .

Casimir,20,Disappointing,"The restaurant is supposed to open at 10, we arrived at 10:15, they were still setting up tables and chairs. When I asked if they were open, I was met by a very rude woman who said yes for coffee or drinks but the kitchen was not yet open. When I asked when the kitchen would be open she advised 11:30, an entire hour and a half after they indicate they are open. Just be honest."

Casimir,50,A great find!,"I was unexpectedly delayed at Gare du Nord, and popped in to Chez Casimir for a very quick dinner. I was well impressed. There are many poor restaurants in this area, but Chez Casimir is well worth looking up. Great service, great food, great ambience."

Casimir,40,Great find,"A great selection of seasonal, very well cooked, French rustic meals. Top qualify for and service. Turbot, oysters, ox bone marrow with steak tartare."

Casimir,30,No longer the delight it used to be,"I visited this restaurant several times before Covid and was always charmed by the varied (fixed price) menu on offer, particularly the wonderful cheese trolley! But we were very disappointed to find that they've abandoned the fixed price 4-course menu and now it's just a normal menu. The food was fine but not outstanding for the price. There are many hundreds of restaurants in Paris doing reasonable food for lower prices than this, so without the cheese trolley inclusion there is nothing to distinguish it. I won't bother going back."

Casimir,50,"Delicious food and wine in a relaxed, cosy atmosphere","Gastromic delight from the beginning to the end of the meal. Very traditional French food, revisited with talent.  Œufs mimosas, os à moelle, oysters for starters. Roast quayle, monkfish and stuffed artichoke as main. Paris-Brest, mousse au chocolat, rum baba and an exquisite bread and butter pudding to finish.  Great wine cellar for all tastes.  Not cheap, €239 for 4, but well worth it!  If you want to enjoy yourselves, just do it!"

Casimir,10,Excited but disappointed,"Having booked to visit this restaurant after more than 2 years away , we where excited at what the profession had to offer .    The restaraunt is rustic , but that’s no excuse for scruffy dressed waiters , with so little passion for their profession.    I had the oysters and unless they are not fresh , not much can go wrong . The 6 that landed on my plate where ok , not close to our visit to Whitstable in Kent, in which we had oysters from the fishing boats onto your plate .    My wife opted for the pate . Her verdict was not sure what has gone into this , but it was not to her liking , so 50% was left on her plate .    Interestingly the waiter did not ask was it to much or not to your liking , as I’m sure did not the chef .    I opted for beef in wine sauce and baby potatoes. Well the steak ( 2 small pieces) was as tough as old boots and just edible . The sauce was as thin as drinking water .    The wine list was amusing, having the waiter popping into the cellar ( a cupboard ) and after 3 mins coming out with a €35 bottle of red - “ this would work well with beef “ he proclaimed.    Sorry , can only afford €28 . He then went back and found a bottle at €27 .    It was ok .    So to sum up our trip to Chez Casmir , it was €85 badly spent and would I recommend this establishment to fellow diners , a big fat NO !!!    Paris has some wonderful restaurants and if this wants to get back on the map as a worthy contender, then make more effort in the cooking and waiters / owners be happy and smile 😀"

Casimir,30,Average – not special as it used to be,This restaurant used to be outstanding in its class. The menu has become unimaginative and the food was not as well-prepared as I remember. This may coincide with the founding owner having relinquished control to the staff.

Casimir,50,Fantastic wish we could have stayed longer!,We popped up to ground level after metro / train from Bordeaux with an hour to spare before the Eurostar. Spotted Casimir up a back street it looked more 'French' (!) than the other places we passed around Gare du Nord so we called in. Several locals enjoying lunch with wine - a good recommendation. The very helpful Rhian assured us that a vegetarian meal could be prepared in double quick time and it was. How disappointing to rush a spectacular risotto with chanterelles and a carafe of red wine but needs must. Next time we go to Paris this place will be our first stop. The whole place appeared spotless including the loo. Highly recommended and probably spectacular if you are a carnivore

Casimir,40,Sunday brunch!,"We have been here more than once for Sunday brunch, which starts at 10:00 AM. It’s good to come early as there is a wait list by noon.  A nice array of all-you-can-eat starters was laid out: three kinds of pâté, whelks, five or six vegetable salads, quiche, etc. Then a spinach omelette, soupe aux poissons, and a wild boar stew with winter vegetables were served. Finally an all-you-can-eat dessert table had around twelve or more cakes, cookies, puddings, crèmes, and marinated fruits. A small room with wines and their prices allowed you to choose your own. We ate and drank copiously, yet thought we didn’t do justice to the many choices. It was wonderful.  The service was fast but also friendly and attentive.  The low-slung room with outdoor areas has a countrified woody look. Lots of young couples and family groups made a joyous scene.  I know the restaurant has a regular menu on other days, but we have not tried it."

Casimir,10,HORROR AT CASIMIR,A low quality brunch at 30 euros plus 15 in drinks per person .the place was dirty and really cold .  The main courses terrible we could not eat them.  We made a reservation one week in advance and they gave us a table in a place next door to the restaurant which was not heated and dirty .I dont believe sanity and health serbices would aprove at all.  A terrible experience .Afyer aroun 150 reviews I have done this is the second negative i make but i thought you should be adviced .DO NOT GO or at least make sure they dont give you a table in the warehouse or whatever thet place is that they put us .

Casimir,50,Delicious French brasserie,"Excellent typical French brasserie, near Gare du Nord. Short menu, everything is homemade and fresh. Good service, reasonable price."

Casimir,50,A French feast for Sunday brunch,"This restaurant is within minutes of the gard de nord but down a quiet back street away from the busy main thouroughfairs. Sunday brunch is a leisurely affair with many courses, each prepared very well and bringing the flavours of French cuisine to the table. I especially enjoyed the various desserts. Cider and wine is of the highest quality and overall Good value for money. It can be very busy so book early."

Casimir,50,Saviour of meals in Paris,"Was looking for different restaurant when walking past this restaurant and saw how busy it was. Fully booked for that night so booked for next. Had the fixed price dinner, I think 35euro for 4 courses. Great service great meal."

Casimir,50,Little secret in Paris gate du nord,Every time I visit Paris and stay at a hotel in gate du nord I visit this place and have dinner there. Food is just great and personal even they are French very friendly. It is an insider Tipp away from the typical tourist traps that are around gate du nord station. Will come again next time. A must to try. Georg

Casimir,50,So much great food at brunch!,"Solo brunch this morning after my friend missed her train. Great salad buffet of vegetable, fish and terrines. I overdid it on the fresh bread, salted butter and melted cheese. The dessert buffet was wonderful. Service pleasant and helpful."

Casimir,40,Grouse in Paris!,"Needing somewhere for lunch near the Eurostar terminal we found an online article from the Guardian suggesting this place which sounded ideal and upon finding it, looked very promising in spite of the typical surly welcome if that’s what you call being totally ignored by a slovenly woman who was talking on the telephone. Do these ungrateful people not realise that it’s only us Brits that keep them in business?  We could scarcely believe our eyes to see grouse on the menu which the waiter also confessed to never having seen before and having been away all summer and only having managed to get one batch sent over to Poland so far, we jumped at the chance and were not disappointed. There were adequate langoustines to start and great clafoutis after. Not bad at all!"

Casimir,40,Good food but not enough serving staff,"Great brunch at a reasonable price. Dinner is a bit expensive and not such an exciting menu....but there's a lot to eat and frankly we went in a group, and everyone was very happy with the experience. I've had 2 brunches and 1 dinner there. At dinner the service was incredibly slow as there were only 2 waiters for about 60 people....not their fault, but really the owner terribly overworks his staff and it spoils the evening a bit."

Casimir,50,Prix fixe with a massive cheese board,"I had a prix fixe, with the food being good overall. The cod main was very tasty, with the highlight being the huge cheese board which was a bit daunting for one person."

Casimir,40,Nice quiet place close to busy Gare du Nord,"I went there upon recommendation of a business relation.  I loved the place.  This is a typical Parisian brasserie style restaurant very well located close to Gare du Nord, but with much less crowds, at a small quiet square.  The menu offers a variety of daily specials. Many of them are original and allow for a nice choice between fish and meat.  We had the lobster salad with algae. Nice preparation, good quality and flavors.  As main we had the brandade of fish, a kind of grilled potatoe mash with pieces of fish and cheese. Very tasty.  The decoration of the place is very simple, basic brasserie style. They have a terrace in the sun.  Service is friendly and efficient.  Prices are ok for the quality and portions you get.  What I liked a lot, apart from the food, was the location. It’s a much quieter place compared to the sometimes stressful busy Gare du Nord area. And yet it’s five minutes a walk from the station.  Will go back there."

Casimir,40,Go there before you take the TGV,"Very close to Care Du Nord. My wife had for the main course a tuna steak that was not of the quality that she expected. My choice was better, ossobuco. Very tasty. Go for the white or red house wines. We will visit this place again!!"

Casimir,50,My go-to in Paris. To the point I went 3 times this trip,"This is a truly local neighborhood place.  Nice bar with good wine and beer selections.    I did Sunday brunch for the first time this trip. You get unlimited starter buffet (quiche, salads, cheese, and much more), and 4 hot courses (omelette, quail, mussels, I forgot the last), and a buffet of desserts.    For dinner, their stewed veal in a cast iron. Coccotte is amazing. Always my favorite. Tried fish another night and similarly delicious.    For large parties they limit you to a set menu. Otherwise there is a bigger selection menu for smaller parties.    Oh and the cheese plate (pay fix price or included in set menu) and all kinds of cheeses on the plate just take what you want.    And home baked desserts. Chocolate cake being my fav.    You won't go wrong coming here."

Casimir,50,"Only one word ,Exquisite!!","Myself and my family found this not so obvious restaurant on thecway back to London, at first when you go in you probably wouldn't think that what you may experience will be so worth it. It's a genuinly French restaurant, from the interior of the venue to the food, I doubt you can't get any more authentic French cuisine and place than that . Being very fussy with myself I was worried I won't like anything on the menu,but the staff were so helpfull and kind and I've made a choice, OMG from the starter to thecdesrt, this was seriously the best food I've ever had in a very long time! The way it was cooked it was simply excquisite, you must try to undestand ! My family had lamb and steaks thstvwere cooked with a divine French sauces and cindiments, wine was really good too. The place is visited mainly by French people I think ,so itvrrally doesn't not feel the typical touristy place . I can't recommend this place high enough!"

Casimir,40,An experience,"I had an exquisite crab consomme but was dismayed to find the cochon de Biscaye tough and difficult to chew, though very tasty. From outside the appearance belies the quality of the experience inside!"

Casimir,40,Recommended,Fixad three Course menu and all is good. Mostly packed with People so be prepared to squeeze in. Food and wine typical french but on the high end.

Casimir,50,The Sunday buffet was fantastic and definitely prepared us for the Eurostar journey ahead of us,"We didn't know quite what to expect for our Sunday Brunch 'buffet'. Were we not pleasantly surprised - it was fantastic and definitely prepared us for the Eurostar and subsequent train journey.  I don't know quite where to start other than all of the dishes by a happy co-incidence tend to be those I'd normally choose in Northern French restaurants. A small number of hot dishes arrived at the table. The mussels were as succulent as I've tasted anywhere. The buffet included a large number of cold dishes all of which were delicious. It catered for vegans and meat eaters with the lovely Pate. in particular, the Mont D'Or cheese was the largest I've ever seen and a meal in its own right with the bread provided.  The deserts including the Tarte Maman were simply delicious and necessitated some second helpings!"

Casimir,40,Authentic French experience,"When in Paris, it’s a must to wine and dine at an authentic French restaurant, and i couldn’t recommend this highly enough. Their menu options is limited but only because their food is carefully planned and deliciously made! from starter to dessert! None of the owners nor waiters spoke English but i kinda like it, it adds to the authenticity of this French restaurant."

Chanterelle,40,Outdoor seating available,"We celebrated three birthdays and had a nice lunch there. The outdoor seating is good because there are heaters. Good food, and fast service. We had fish tacos and a salad, and chocolate cake to share."

Chanterelle,40,Breakfast,Pleasant place in downtown Edmonds to have a solo breakfast. Have also been there with friends and family. Good food.

Chanterelle,50,Lovely Ambiance,"I have a food intolerance problem and I was thrilled to find a salad on the menu that was perfect for me. They have a wide selection of healthy items, the decor is lovely as is the staff. Our lunch was perfect."

Chanterelle,40,Brunch,"This small restaurant always full, good place for breakfast, lunch or candle dinner. Have a small bar inside, sit back and relax enjoying your favorite drink"

Chanterelle,50,Super lunch choice!,"Wonderful staff, awesome food, and lovely atmosphere! Definitely recommend. The owner is lovely and works to create a special place!"

Chanterelle,50,Food and service were wonderful.,I had the tomato bisque and whitefish. The bisque was awesome and the cod nicely prepared and presented. Service was prompt without being overbearing.

Chanterelle,30,Vegetarian?,So this place comes up first when you Google restaurants in Edmonds that are vegetarian There’s literally ONE vegetarian entrée. ONE

Chanterelle,50,Brunch!,This place was so cute and so yummy! I had the crab Benedict and it was amazing. We will definitely be back.

Chanterelle,40,Breakfast with friends,"Comfortable spot in the heart of Edmonds with a varied and usually very tasty menu. Non pretentious, good food. Bar service available, delicious desserts."

Chanterelle,40,Great neighborhood restaurant in charming Edmonds,"We have enjoyed going to this restaurant for over 20 years. It used to be the only place in town at which we would eat dinner. There is more competition now and Chanterelle's has upped their game in order to compete yet still retain their cherished dishes. We think they have some of the best clam chowder around (but it is only available on Fridays). Their tomato bisque is also good. I usually order either the Chanterelle chicken salad (but ask for the creamy olivado dressing as the other is pretty bland) or the seafood stew (which is enough for 2 meals for me). My husband experiments but his favorite is the clams and linguine. There are multi course specials but we find it it too much food for us. They did not start out serving cocktails but have added this to their repertoire. They are quite tasty and reasonably priced, especially during happy hour."

Chanterelle,10,Wish it was better,"Had been waiting 25 minutes for our meals, when we were told by the server that they were out of the steak my wife ordered. Then told us that the manager had just gone to the store to buy more steaks and our order was up next. Was easily 35 minutes before we got our food. Food was average, at best. No apology, just excuses. Unfortunately, not a good experience. Probably just a bad chain of events, but they didn't handle it well. Not much regard for customer service."

Chanterelle,50,Delicious and relaxing atmosphere,"Chanterelles is a local hangout with excellent food. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner selection are deliciously described and sometimes hard to choose and I always end up eating the ciopino and bread! Full bar and just fun and relaxing. Small city parking lot or street parking and after-banking hours parking also available."

Chanterelle,20,pretty average,"we made a Friday evening reservation and were surprised when we arrived at restaurant to find it very quiet.    our server was a little too enthusiastic and returned to take our orders every 2 minutes as we were trying to make our minds up what to have.    I had the tomato bisque to start which was tasty, but I was only half way through when our entrees arrived. Our server apologized for them being ready to soon, and then left them on the table. We had to ask her to take them back to kitchen to keep them warm as we didn’t want to rush our starters, or have our main courses get cold.    Overall dinner was ok, but unfortunately not the experience we had expected after having read other travelers reviews."

Chanterelle,50,Still a good place to go for a quiet meal with friends,"I wrote the following review two years ago, and what I said then is still true today. It is my default place in Edmonds to meet friends for breakfast, and it is a favorite of mine for dinners as well.    October 17, 2017  I recently ate at Chanterelle a number of times, several times for breakfast and a few for dinner. It is excellently situated on Edmond's Main Street, in the charming downtown area. The ownership and staff are friendly, efficient and accommodating. The breakfast menu is quite varied including fruit plates, parfaits, house oatmeal, and a variety of egg, potato, pancake, waffle, bagel, benedict, vegetarian, Asian, and Mexican plates. Everything I have tried has been nicely prepared and tasty. Again their dinner menu is quite varied and offers a nice selection of appetizers, salads, and entrees. They are also nicely presented and are well prepared. I have tried several things over the years but most recently their pork loin sautee in a fruity (apricot and cranberry) Madiera wine sauce. I think that their fruity wine sauces are especially good. As you might expect of a place located little more than a literal stone's throw from salt water, it also offers a nice selection of fish and seafood small plates as well as dinner entrees. The wine list is modest but well selected, with offerings which pair nicely with the entrees. The ambience is casual and emotionally warm. There are the general restaurant background sounds of quiet conversation and dinnerware clinking, but we found those not to be distracting. It is a good, comfortable place to go with friends."

Chanterelle,50,Back again,The happy hour drink and dinner specials are well worth the visit. The meatloaf that we ordered was the quintessential comfort meal. We have previously enjoyed the fish and pork entrees on the happy hour dinner menu. The staff are very friendly and they provide outstanding service.

Chanterelle,20,Mexican food on Main St Bothell Gallo De Oro,"Let's start by saying this is a six person response.It was about 6 pm no one in the restaurant should have been a warning. We all ordered something different the opinion was the same no flavor ! My bottle of beer was flat I told the waitress she asked if I wanted another one not meaning a replacement. The others asked what type of wine did they have waitress said Red they asked was it Cab, Merlot Zen? waitress said Red we asked if she could check she came back said it was Cab and Merlot but they were out of Cab. We went there because we were told it had a great outdoor dinning, it has tables and chairs outside. Would not recommend."

Chanterelle,40,"Pleasant, tasty","A first class place for lunch. When paired with a visit to Edmonds downtown or the Cascade Museum of Art, a perfect short day trip from Seattle."

Chanterelle,40,Happy hour,"I have eaten often at Chanterelle and have been happy with the food and the service. Ambiance is a bit casual for a special date night, but comfortable for breakfast or lunch. Happy hour menu is not as good as the other menus. My favorite meal there is breakfast--always a winner."

Chanterelle,50,"Nicely filled place, nicely filling meal","Summer isn’t summer without a visit to Edmonds, and a visit to Edmonds isn’t complete if you don’t have a meal at Chanterelle. We were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table, though there were plenty of people there. There are even a couple of tables outside on the sidewalk. The waiters are attentive without being intrusive; the wait for food long enough for conversation but not interminable. We enjoyed our salads."

Chanterelle,40,Wished it lived up to my expectations,"So I picked this restaurant bases on the high Trip Advisor reviews and so my expectations were high. Half of us were pleased with the Meatloaf and Black & White Tuna. But my daughter and I thought our meals were just okay. She had the bean burrito and I had the Whitefish with Capers & red potatoes. I thought mine was underseasoned. The lemon bar and Berry pie was okay.    I was just bummed. It was a toss-up between here and Arnie's. I wish I would have chose Arnie's because we would have a view and could have easily walked from our hotel, Best Western Plus Edmonds Bay which was only a block or two from the hotel."

Chanterelle,40,"Very good food, great service and ambiance","Been meaning to try Chanterelle when visiting Edmonds and finally did so. The four of us had dinner. The staff was welcoming and took our drink and food orders with little delay. The menu covered all bases in food tastes, which can be a negative. We each ordered a different entree and all were very satisfied with our meals. Scampi, Salmon, Pork Loin, and a Pork Sautee were excellent. Our Server was very attentive. The ambiance was very nice. It was not noisy and we could actually carry on a conversation over dinner. I highly recommend Chanterelle."

Chanterelle,40,Eggsactly what Breakfast Should Be,"This is a great little spot in Edmonds, not too far from the ferry dock if you've come in from Kingston or Seattle. Breakfast is hearty and well-described on the menu. I sat at the bar because I was breakfasting alone and I have to say the service was excellent. Notably this little restaurant is well patronized by Edmonds locals."

Chanterelle,50,Delicious lunch served by welcoming staff,Enjoyed the delicious tomato bisque soup and outstanding grilled cheese sandwich for lunch. I was pleased they offered a smaller version and its size was just right. Wait staff was very friendly and polite. Cute place!

Chanterelle,40,"Nice Menu, Friendly Staff!",This is a nice place for lunch while in Edmonds. The menu is interesting and the food is good. I enjoyed sitting outside on Main Street to enjoy the view and people-watching. I would definitely go back when in Edmonds.

Chanterelle,50,Excellent lunch,"We were here for lunch. Both of us ordered the meatloaf sandwich. It was excellent. It does come with Texas toast on both sides, so it is more of a knife and fork lunch rather than what is usually thought of as a sandwich. The wait staff was polite and attentive, without hovering.    A suggestion, if on Saturday, arrive a bit early. As we left there were at least 3 groups waiting for tables."

Chanterelle,50,A Cozy Restaurant in Edmonds... A Quaint Town on the Sound,"Well, I often cross the sound... just for fun, and Edmonds is a goto place. And, if I find myself there in the morning, after having a walk, I enjoy Chanterelle. It's a warm, cozy cafe with good food, excellent baked food, hot chocolate, and fabulous wait staff.    You simply couldn't find a better place for a nice breakfast, with a cup of coffee and a paper.    Enjoy,  Michael"

Chanterelle,20,Absolutely Average,"We ordered a couple salads - but just know there is not a chanterelle mushroom on the menu. They love apples, though, so it’s hard to find a salad without an apple. And hard to find a salad that didn’t have a sweet honey dressing. The salads we ordered could have been made from Costco - nothing special, nothing to write home about - and the bill came to nearly $40. For a $10 meal.  This restaurant just isn’t all that memorable nor exciting nor worth a trip back. The service was average and nothing that made the experience a bit more palatable."

Chanterelle,50,Yummy and worth the visit,We relied on trip advisor reviews to lead us to a perfect right choice for dinner. We enjoyed an artichoke and mushroom pasta with house salad. Wine choice did not disappoint. We are glad we were there early ... within 45 minutes the place filled to capacity ..... not much sound mitigation but we were ready till head out. Troy provides excellent service and anticipated our every need. We can see why this is a top puck in Edmonds

Chanterelle,50,Lunch with my sister,"Chanterelle is the perfect place for lunch in Edmonds. The place is charming, the food good, the service friendly, and it is right in the middle of many shops. Try the tomato soup; it's wonderful!"

Chanterelle,50,Stopped for Easter brunch---Excellent,"We were having trouble finding a place open and decided to try Edmonds. and Chanterelle was open! Wow! did we have a great meal. I had the dungeness crab eggs Benedict and my husband had the salmon lox eggs Benedict. Each came with a pile of fresh fruit that was delicious--no half ripe strawberries or green cantalope, it was all perfect. My only comment would be that it wasn't just dungeness crab, it was a crab cake on each E. muffin. The crab cakes certainly could have done with less filler, but what should I expect for such a reasonable price?"

Chanterelle,50,"Need ""Gluten Free""? They can serve it. Healthy and Delicious Food in Downtown Edmonds.",Lucky us! My brother-in-law treated us to breakfast at Chanterelle for our anniversary. I kept it simple with a piece of coffee cake and a cappuccino. My sister-in-law ordered the seafood omelet which looked delicious. A generous portion. She took half home. My husband ordered a fruit and yogurt parfait which he said was delicious. And my brother in law ordered a more traditional breakfast. Very comfortable booth in a very busy place. Get there early to get a seat. A popular Sunday dining spot and I can see why.

Chanterelle,30,Nice Old-Fashioned Restaurant,"This is a pretty place and clearly, very popular in Edmonds. The lunch menu had the usual things, but if you are on a carbohydrate-restricted diet, you will have a hard time finding anything on the menu that works for you. Even the salad dressings are sweet! The food was very okay.    Service was pleasant, so-so for speed, but this isn't a grab-a-quick-bite sort of place. It is a good place to meet up for lunch and a long chat."

Chanterelle,20,EH,"The owner or the chef must have changed. This used to be a fabulous restaurant and now it is eh.  My tacos came out on a white plate and looked like burritos rolling around an otherwise empty plate. Not one other item , not parsley. Tasted Mexican but Mexican what I don’t know?  Would not go back."

Chanterelle,40,Great Staff!,"So the staff was the highlight here. They are so kind and have just what it takes to wait on people. Have you ever been out and you are trying to make eye contact with anyone who is working that can help you but every server that isn't waiting on you totally avoids you? NOT HERE, they worked as a team to make sure we had a great experience and they should be applauded for that, well done! The menu is substantial and I would like ot try several dishes but I went light with a grilled salmon salad, my wife went with a chicken panini, and my daughter ate the pizza. The pizza is just right for a kid, it is like a chef boyardee pizza with just chees and she loved it, so good to go. My wife's panini was just a bit bland but the corn chowder was surprisingly good. It had great flavor. I couldn't tell if it was a terragon or something else but it was delicious and I've only heard of corn and chicken chowder and this was definitely vegitarian but well seasoned and substantial. My grilled salmon salad was very nice. It had tiny mango bits which I really liked how tiny they were chopped up with romaine and tasty vinegarette. This place is like a hummingbird feeder for 40-60 year old females with liberal arts degrees so if this is your demographic and you want to pal around with your girlfriends and talk about... Maybe you should Google, ""What old ladies talk about"" in case you don't know. Try it, it might interest you. Or, if you're an old dude lookin' for chicks hit this place up. The food is solid and the atmosphere is very bright and nice, we enjoyed it very much."

Chanterelle,50,Chanterelle Valentine’s Lunch,Excellent food and service. This is our favorite restaurant for celebrations as well as any time. Very welcoming and fun!

Chanterelle,40,Consistantly good restaurant,Have had lunch here several times. Always consistent. Good food and good service. They have a great selection on the menu so most everyone can find something they will like. I had the turkey panini that was very good. The chicken quesadilla - and enough at lunch to take some home. Salads are good. Easy to recommend Chanterelles.

Chanterelle,50,Homey friendly relaxation great Sunday brunch,"Chanterelle recently changed ownership after the originals retired. They took great care in selling to someone committed to maintain the same quality and comfort that they had worked so hard to achieve. The food is well prepared and presented. Waitstaff is friendly and helpful. Be prepared to wait if you go for Sunday Brunch. In general, they don’t take reservations for that because of the steady influx of customers. But if you give them a call say 30 minutes before you plan to arrive, they often can give you some advice and “work with you” to limit your wait. If nothing else, they will put you on the waitlist based on when you called instead of when you got there."

Chanterelle,30,Ok not great,Recent lunch visit a letdown. Wife's Cesar salad was blah My open face crab was blah Companions sandwich not toasted as she asked Her husband got bowl of soup but no bread until requested. Soup was excellent.

Chanterelle,40,Excellent Food and Service,"Lunch with a friend and wanted a reliable place to eat. Chanterelle definitely lived up to its reputation. Menu had good choices, the tomato bisque soup was a standout. My friend had the pulled pork and found it to be outstanding. Plenty of sauce and tender meat made it worth another trip. Our waitress was able to recommend a wine that I would order again.  Crowded but maintained good service throughout."

Chez Jacqueline,10,Avoid this restaurant,"Terrible service. My group waited 2 hours for food that ranged from overpriced and poor to adequate. One of us had a $22 bowl of very salty gumbo with pieces of crawfish shell in the gumbo, accompanied by cold rice. The other food was just okay. The restaurant was not busy, but every group in there waited at least 90 minutes for their food. The walls in the bathroom had large places where the paper had torn off."

Chez Jacqueline,10,Very strange,Wow we are still waiting for our food after 90 minutes in a not crowded place on Saturday afternoon this is literally the longest I have ever waited for my food not sure what to do Don’t come if you do not have lots of time

Chez Jacqueline,10,Bad experience,"Overpriced, DIRTY place, 20% of tips added on the bill without noticing the clients, long wait to be served COLD and LOW quality food. We will never come back and we will certainly never recommend this place to anyone."

Chez Jacqueline,10,Puzzled,"I am puzzled by the high reviews. This place is dirty, extremely slow service and over priced for the food quality. We will never return or recommend."

Chez Jacqueline,50,Little bit of heaven!,"Breauxe Bridge, LA- this is a little bit of heaven. The food is absolutely genuine french. The ambience is to die for. The owner is as real as it gets. We got the seafood gumbo and it was wonderful. We ordered the jumbo shrimp in white wine sauce. We both thought life couldn't get any better, Then Jacquline brought some Brie cheese to taste followed by a 7 layer cake, chocolate icing, the hint of almond and the world was complete. We sat there for two hours eating, smelling, appreciating and relaxing. Indeed worth every penny. It felt like I had dropped back into my grandmothers kitchen."

Chez Jacqueline,50,Best kept secret in Louisiana!,"I was drawn to this little cozy place the last time my wife and I shopped on Bridge St. but we had already eaten. So we went back to explore. WOW! What a treat! We have never had such authentic and delicious seafood. It's more French than Cajun with a little southern twist. The service is amazing and the eclectic decor is captivating. Don't go if you are in a hurry. Nothing gets cooked until ordered. The perfect place for a bottle of wine and conversation. (they have large to-go boxes which you will need) Oh, I forgot about the loaf of HOT french bread and butter!"

Chez Jacqueline,50,A MUST go to for a great experience!,"A MUST go to for a great experience!  Jacqueline and her daughter are a duo that you must meet. The food is to die for! Let Jacqueline pick for you as we did, tell her your taste in food and she’ll cook you something incredibly AWESOME, that said of course being from France myself we hit it off really quickly, so that said you may want to ask for Cajun rather than French if it’s your taste, after all we all like different food and different cuisines. Let me say that this Lady can cook, and I mean she CAN COOK LOL! Her daughter (I apologize that I forgot her name)is the waitress and she is just as awesome as her mom. It truly felt like I was back home in France and having a meal in a small country town. And I made a new friend while there, I love me some Jacqueline. Definitely will go back, and sooner than later.  One note, don’t go if you’re looking for “frou-frou“ or a dog and pony show, it truly has the atmosphere of a small town hole in the wall kinda of place like you would find in France. Did I mention I LOVED it?"

Chez Jacqueline,50,Love Love Love the food here!,"Chez Jacqueline prepares each meal when you order. Nothing on steamer tables or tired leftovers here. Because the food is cooked only when you order it you must wait for your food to be prepared. In our fast paced, instant world we live in today many folks are unfamiliar with waiting for your meal to be prepared, but it is sooo worth the wait. We drive 6 hours from Texas just to have dinner with Chez Jacqueline! Her French onion soup is my favorite and she makes it for breakfast for me. And her pancakes are like no other pancakes you have ever had - ever! The portions are all very large, delicious and piping hot when served. Don't miss out on this local little gem. Bring cash as credit cards are not accepted, but ATM's are readily available. Enjoy!"

Chez Jacqueline,50,BEST CRAB CAKES I EVER HAD,Jacqueline is an amazing chef and a charming hostess. I stopped in for a late lunch and had the entire place to myself. She made me the most wonderful crab cakes I have ever eaten and then kept me company while I enjoyed my lunch. I can't wait to visit the area so I can dine there again.

Chez Jacqueline,50,Hungry ?,"Great food and friendly people. Jacqueline is a wonderful French chef and she can make a hamburger sing. My wife and I travel from the Baton Rouge area to eat there once and awhile for many years and have never been disappointed. If your in a hurry and want fast food, this is NOT the place to go. But, slow down and enjoy a wonderful breakfast or lunch and you will not be disappointed. One thing we alway enjoyed was that fact that she normally comes to your table to visit with you. She's s sweet lady serving delicious food."

Chez Jacqueline,20,"Simple food, long waits","I'd avoid this place since the food is nothing above ordinary, waiting times are long and has one of the dirtiest toilets I've ever seen in the US. Owner continuously speaking with customers while they're waiting for their food (and also while they eat) instead of providing faster service. We waited 30 minutes on a monday lunchtime with less than 10 persons in the tables. For frozen fried food of course. The attempt of giving a french flavour is funny at best."

Chez Jacqueline,40,"Charming, especially Jacqueline","My go-to breakfast place with good eggs, grits and terrific bacon! Secret bloody mary's are fantastic."

Chez Jacqueline,50,A great lunch,Jacqueline is French Lady cooking to perfection. We recommend you to stop and to taste her cuisine. She provide us the best of the cajun cuisine. Stop and visit her.

Chez Jacqueline,50,Homey French Restaurant,"This warm, friendly, family feeling French restaurant was wonderful. Not elegant, rather like home. The food was very good and unique. Must return"

Chez Jacqueline,50,REAL Turtle soup and amazing 7 layer cake by a cajun grandma!,Only place to eat in this town for authentic cajun cuisine. Don't be in a hurry at all. Jacqueline is a real cajun grandma and makes everything from scratch. The turtle soup was actually all turtle! (who knew they have so many small bones). Very tasty. The 7 layer cake had amaretto between the layers and was the best cake I have ever eaten. Be willing to spend 2 hours here waiting for your food and eating it. This is a place to savor and the cook is an amazing authentic person who really knows how to cook the local cuisine.

Chez Jacqueline,50,What a Gem!,Late breakfast. Jacqueline waited on us and cooked the food - just like the last time we were in town four years ago. Had her beignets and eggs Florentine with ham on an English muffins with artichoke hollandaise sauce. Amazing! She’s super friendly and always has plenty of stories. A delight!

Chez Jacqueline,50,A Jewel in a Rustic Setting,"Only visit Chez Jacqueline if you have time to visit with her and time to enjoy a scrumptious meal. I stumbled upon this gem, and it is to be treasured. Don't bother with typical fried food which you can find anywhere. Enjoy this delicious french cuisine in a relaxed setting. Just let go and go along with her recommendations."

Chez Jacqueline,50,Excallent food friendly service,"I had the crab cakes and seafood bisque and my wife had the seafood gumbo. All the dishes were excellent. Real homecooking as it should be. My only complaint eight dollars for a glass ogf wine in a plastic cup, come on you can do better than that!"

Chez Josephine,10,Food poisoning,Got food poisoning from fish. Very sick for two days. Fish must be held correctly. I suffered a lot and my stomach is still not right!!

Chez Josephine,10,Good Riddance to a Once Prestigious Place,"Filthy Dirty, Not French nor anything about it , Nasty Rude Manager Refused to tell us the owner ……..never again. Good riddance"

Chez Josephine,50,Chez Josephine est Magnifique!,This is a MUST dining experience if you visit NYC. It is an homage to Josephine Baker (try the Bakertini) and my dining experience could not have been better! Wonderful jazz piano served with the most delectable food! Loved it! ❤👏⭐

Chez Josephine,50,A favorite,"Excellent food and lovely atmosphere. The piano player was great, and even played Happy Birthday to me! All of the food, on the Restaurant Week Dinner and the a la carte menu was delicious."

Chez Josephine,50,After theatre dinner,"After theatre dinner. Crab cakes, duck and trout amandine were all delicious. Service was attentive after a long night. The wine by the glass was well chosen."

Chez Josephine,50,Alfredo is the BEST,"This restaurant is always a go-to for me because of the wonderful food, value and service but I need to call out floor manager Alfredo for the special attention he gave us when I brought my niece and her partner there after a Broadway show. Alfredo made the BEST recommendations, ensuring that my family's visit was nothing short of amazing. (If you're thinking profiteroles and Alfredo recommends the apple tart, go with Alfredo's suggestion.) Alfredo bestowed complimentary glasses of champagne on us to cap off an exquisite meal."

Chez Josephine,50,My favorite meal of the week in New York,"My wife and I spent a few days in New York. We got to try several restaurants. This was our favorite. We had 2:00 Hamilton tickets, so we arrived for lunch at noon according to our reservations. We were the first guests. We were seated in the window. Such a treat.    The moment you walk through the door you will be swept back in time. If you know the movie ""Midnight in Paris"", you will have flashbacks. There is Parisian music playing in the background. Sweeping curtains adorn the windows. Turn of the century chandeliers hang from the ceiling and fill the tiny little room. White table cloths cover the tables and old movie posters and burlesque pictures cover the walls.    A polite server with a French accent greets you at the door and takes your order. Perhaps we got personalized serviced being there so early, but it was fantastic. The music was perfect. I was often humming and swaying while sipping my wine.    The food was great. I have not had pate in a very long time, so that was a treat. The spaghetti josephine was spicy and delicious. Our whole tab including tip was $200, so it's a little spendy."

Chez Josephine,10,Awful slow service and cold food. Give it a miss.,"Dreadful food - was completely cold. Sent a new one and was still cold. Apparently manager couldn't do anything.. offered some snacks instead. Bear in mind thos was not a cheap event. Drinks took over 40mins to arrive and were wrong. The performers were quite good. But mist definitely not worth it - reminded me of those canteen style ""banquet""events ftom 90s. t"

Chez Josephine,20,Words Can Cut Like a Knife,"Before Covid, I attended the Broadway theater several times a year and always chose Chez Josephine for my pre-show dinner. My husband and I also brought business acquaintances to the restaurant. I loved the ambience, piano music and great French food. Last night was my first time back in the theater district and it was my birthday so I made an early reservation at Chez Josephine at 5:15 to ensure that I would be able to take a leisurely stroll to the 52nd street theater for the 7:00 pm show. The restaurant was sparsely filled at this early hour so I assumed their would be no problem getting finishing our meal to leave at 6:30. Unfortunately, I didn't count on our waiter Alfredo sabotaging that effort. At 6:10 my husband and I still hadn't gotten our food so we called Alfredo over to ask him when our food was coming. He surlily answered that ""it will be here when it's here"". I couldn't believe my ears. He finally brought our food 10 minutes later. We now had to shove our food down our throats in order to get out in time not to have to run all the way to the theater. Normally, I'd just write a bad review and leave it at that but I was pretty outraged at this point so when my husband went to the bathroom and Alfredo came over to pick up our credit card( without a tip) I decided to tell him that what he did was the height of rudeness. He should have said, 'I 'll go check for you"". He started muttering that it was crowded(not for at least the first 1/2 hour that we were at the restaurant). This was bull...it as people that came in after us had their food and as I told him, arrogance and rudeness wasn't acceptable. I told the manager (at least that's who he said he was) and he just said ""sorry"". He should have called the waiter over and  told him his behavior was unacceptable. Apparently, this restaurant thinks that all people attending a Broadway show are tourists and they won't be repeat customers so service doesn't matter. A restaurant's service shouldn't stink because it's assumed that most of the restaurant's patrons are not like me who lives in New York and frequently dines in the City. They still deserve to be treated properly. You shouldn't have to leave a restaurant with a bad taste in your mouth from poor service."

Chez Josephine,50,"Great experience, nice vibe","The escargot was cooked perfectly, and my husband and I had a wonderful, relaxing evening here in December 2022. It was very busy, but didn't feel crowded, just lively, with a lovely piano player. We had a great meal."

Chez Josephine,50,Fun Evening and Great Food!,"My husband and I had our first evening meal at this restaurant upon our arrival to NYC. We loved the music during the evening. We sat near the bar instead of right by the piano and singer and could talk uninterrupted. We ordered drinks to begin. I highly recommend the Bakertini...yummm! We had the fig, prosciutto with feta cheese appetizer...yummm. For dinner, I ordered the trout almandine and my husband had the scallops. They were served with sides at no additional cost. We ended the meal by sharing a chocolate mousse cake. All of our food was DELICIOUS, and the service was great! Add this restaurant to your agenda for a fun evening!"

Chez Josephine,50,Paris in NYC,"On our annual NYC holiday trip, my wife and I returned to Chez Josephine. The last time we dined here was for lunch but we wanted to return for dinner. Chez Josephine has a warm, cozy an romantic interior with a full bar and a pianist. We began with two delicious appetizers of a fig. goat cheese and prosciutto salad and the Chinese raviolis with goat cheese filling. Entrees were the lobster cassoulet and the filet mignon au poivre. The cassolet was filled with seafood in a savory broth and the steak was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. Chez Josephine is a Paris jewel box in NYC. Definitely give the a try."

Chez Josephine,40,Glad I experienced it but no need to return.,"The atmosphere is interesting as I assume to reflect an eatery in Paris to portray the French restaurant. That said, it was extremely dark which made it difficult to read the menu as the lights are dimmed and the lone candle on the table barely provided enough light. Nonetheless, the service was attentive and drinks were on point. My two main issues were the food, as it was not seasoned to be a French restaurant (mashed potatoes and asparagus tasted like they were boiled and placed on the plate) and the door being opened the entire time as the temperature was dropping outside which made it uncomfortable to enjoy and concentrate on the experience."

Chez Laurence,50,"Great food, ambiance and value for money","Undoubtedly the best restaurant in Sete. We have been many times over the years, before the restaurant was expanded. The food and service never disappoints. We had an excellent 3 dishes to share between 2. Grilled oysters, gambas and Fried anchovies accompanied by good bread, and excellent homemade mayonnaise. With a bottle of good wine, aperos and coffee the bill was less than 60 euros. Excellent value for money and great ambience."

Chez Laurence,50,The Freshest Seafood,"Recommended here by our hotel. Had to wait 30 minutes for a table thus probably worth booking. Incredible seafood, prepared at the front of the restaurant. Went for mussels and oyster gratinee then monkfish. Amazing. Profiteroles to finish. Highly recommended."

Chez Laurence,40,Seafood Galore,"Just a short walk from the hotel this restaurant is on the canal and specializes in local seafood. A small blackboard listing the entrees and mains for the day is brought to the table for your selection. Other ongoing dishes are listed on a separate menu.  The variety is good but be aware, the portions are generous, as are the seafood platters.  There is a good selection of wines, beer and cocktails as well as soft drinks.  The restaurant is very popular and the busy staff appear to have limited English, but we had no problem. It is preferable to make a reservation or come a bit early to get a table.  You get great value for money.  If you’re a seafood lover this restaurant deserves consideration."

Chez Laurence,50,Charitable Events,Enjoyed watching an event supporting a job-profit for women who were touched by breast cancer. For more information call or email the restaurant

Chez Laurence,10,Sete on a Sunday.,"Glorious weather, great company and then we went in this alleged restaurant! O dear, o dear. Poor service. Belligerent waiter. Cold food, Overpriced. Insensitive to dietry requirements. But apart from that.......!"

Chez Laurence,10,Downhill all the way,What used to be our favorite special restaurant. Has come back as an over priced second rate restaurant. The server was clearly inexperienced Ordered the steak special that was both tough and overcooked. The sauce was nonexistent. When checking out we asked the waiter to utilize our gift certificate and put the balance on the credit card. He had no idea how to do that and on his own decided to just split the gift card between both couples. Adding insult to injury he then charged both couples meals to one credit card. When we brought this up to the manager the next day to have it rectified the manager only shrugged by saying that’s the second or third time this happened. What started out as our annual anniversary celebration turned into a complete downer Until they can get their act together I suggest you avoid this overprice place at all costs

Chez Laurence,50,Excellent fish in Setè,Very nice location and friendly service. Fish was excellent and fresh. Even the suggested wine was perfect for the food. Good value for money.

Chez Laurence,50,Antony,"Stayed in Sete recently for 9 days.... visited this restaurant 3 times , what a breath of fresh sea air this place is..... Great, friendly well informed staff , and , if you love sea food at its very best ..... and freshest, chez francoise is the very best 👌 and affordable."

Chez Laurence,50,Fab Evening!,"We made a reservation at Chez Francois (which I would strongly recommend if you intend visiting) and when we arrived there were only 2 free tables left, ours being one of them.    The ambience, the service from Malik and the food were great, entertaining and fabulous. The food was fresh, tasty and reasonably priced.    Highly recommend this restaurant!"

Chez Laurence,30,A typical restaurant on the quaiside at Sete,"We had been recommended this restaurant by my wife's son and for my money, it was not as good as I had hoped. The service was poor and too much chat instead of making sure that we had what we had ordered. My grilled turbot was all right and far better than the one I was given at a nearby restaurant. In retrospect I think that we should have ordered one of those huge platters that include every sort of shell fish. We saw one being delivered and it looked wonderful."

Chez Laurence,30,Service is ok but the dish,Service is ok but the dish I ordered - assiette du pêcheur - is not to be recommended. Oysters and mussels are breaded (which takes all taste away) and is not so well presented in the plate.

Chez Laurence,50,Chez François is just the BEST!,"I have eaten at Chez François many times over the years for both lunch and dinner. This place never fails to amaze me. Their seafood is fresh, exquisitely prepared and reasonably priced. The shell fish plateaux are to die for! And that aïoli is potent and delicious beyond belief. A word of advice--reserve ahead for the terrace in the middle; otherwise you may end up nearly on the sidewalk with the cars and buses zooming by. I usually order the raw shell fish platters, but the fried fish plates are superb as well. The service is friendly, laid back and relaxed. A welcoming place with great food and even better prices."

Chez Laurence,40,Seafood at its best,"Simple, cozy place which offers a great variety of seafood and shellfish. Staff is friendly, fair value for money. Went twice there on two consecutive days."

Chez Laurence,40,Very fresh food,"We went to this restaurant to have a lunchen. It was rather late for a French lunch ( 13:45) though we were admitted luckely. As Sete is the French oyster city we definitely wanted to have oysters for lunch. So we ordered 12, as well as the Mussels Seteoise and Salmon. All was served very fresh and very nice in the French way. The waitress was very polite though did not speak any English. Therefore when you know the French way of eating out this can be a very nice spot to have a very good fresh meal. No Moules / French fries available !"

Chez Laurence,50,A memorable seafood lunch,"We had wonderful lunch sitting outside along the picturesque canal in Sete. The seafood was local, fresh, and skillfully prepared. The grilled shellfish served with garlic aioli was amazing. They were very busy due to the cruise ship in port but service was still good. This wonderful seafood with a glass of local white wine made for a memorable meal in the Mediterranean."

Chez Laurence,50,Antony1,"I dined here 3 times last week , the Dover sole ( twice) was delicious, lobster sublime.... must be the best seafood in Sete and that’s saying something... great"

Chez Laurence,30,Disappointing finish,"So being from Scotland I do live seafood. The oysters were kept in safe water and very salty. Everything else ok. Mains specifically said garlic monkfish. Not that garlicky and waitress told me it supposed to be mild? It was ok but not really what the description said? Service however, I must say I speak little French so appreciative that they did. But we did ask for the bill 3 etimea and waited over 2 minutes which is a bit wairing after an average meal. Seabass however was lovely but overall not the best."

Chez Laurence,40,Excellent no frills seafood,Come here for the seafood. The tower is a sight to behold. Relatively simple food and wine menu but delicious.

Chez Laurence,50,Don’t be in a hurry!,"My guidebook had this restaurant on it’s list of recommendations but it turns out that Sete is rather large with a lot of restaurants! Luckily I happened to ask a local who was coming out of a business what his favourite restaurant was and he pointed across the river at Chez Francois! Not speaking French, it was a little difficult to convey our requests but the wait staff was very good. We ordered two glasses of Rose and split the turbot (fish) which was amazing! All was gluten free as well. Lunch took over two hours and they are in no rush so sit back, relax and enjoy the passing traffic! Three glass of Rose in total and the fish, cost was just over $100 Cdn. Not cheap but well worth it."

Cosette,40,T- michaels is a go to,"We had such a great time. Food, service and ambience were right on point! We are definitely coming back."

Cosette,50,Birthday Day Dinner,It was my birthday. The dinner was great. They checked on us to make sure that everything was as we liked it. The owner was a very nice guy.

Cosette,50,"Excellent, with amazing service","A excellent restaurant, service was very good , Great choice of wines , and the menu is very good , prime rib and steak and lobster both great"

Cosette,40,Beautiful and Tasty,"Beautiful restaurant with gorgeous water views. Plenty of parking as it is located in a shopping area. Large dining rooms and spacious bar. I was there with a large group and a very limited menu but what we tried was delicious and very fresh. The service was friendly and attentive. I will go back on my own to review the full menu, prices, service and different dishes. What I experienced today is quite promising for a wonderful evening."

Cosette,50,5 Star Experience,"This restaurant is a must go to, if in Naples....I am a local and I must say this is a 5 star place with top notch service, atmosphere, food and staff! Maria is an amazing bartender and server!!! I highly recommend this place for a wonderful experience!  You won't regret it!!!"

Cosette,50,"One of my favorite restaurants in Naples, always amazing food and drinks! Outstanding staff! Thank you Maria!",Best water views and food in Naples! Hospitality in this restaurant is outstanding! Very hard-working staff. Ty is amazing and knows how to function a restaurant!

Cosette,50,Another great experience,"Back again, we were. This time the restaurant was surprisingly a buzz considering the time of year . We requested Joe, as usual, and he made the night fun. Regardless of the almost full house, the service was not compromised. The meal was great - I had the porterhouse with an added lobster tail & my wife enjoyed the seafood trio. The smashed cauliflower was as delicious as we remembered it. The kids had petit filets that were gone in a blink along with the steak fries. We shared a creme brulee and cheesecake for dessert and were then off to the movies!"

Cosette,50,Best Service Ever,"We went to T-Michaels after our wedding on the beach. We had Kellie as our waitress and she was AMAZING. She explained the menu to us, gave us tips on what was super tasty and helped us decide what we wanted. She also gave us an amazing photo shoot, and got some amazing pictures for us! I’ve never had such a personable and down to earth waitress like her before!  Plus the steak was amazing!! Food was great. Will definitely be back!"

Cosette,50,Family dinner!,"I went to visit my sister in Naples, Fl from NJ with my second time dining at the restaurant. The views are outstanding along with excellent service provided during our family dinner. The crab cakes and salmon were our favorites. Could not recommend this place enough!"

Cosette,50,The Best in Naples,"We have been going to T Michaels for years. The staff is always friendly and Kevin the bar manager is excellent. Kevin has great bartenders on his staff as well. They have the best happy hour in Naples, and their dinners are very good. We have never had a bad meal."

Cosette,50,Best dining experience I’ve had in awhile!!,"I had the most amazing dinner here with my family. The ambiance is elegant and peaceful, but our server was even better. Madi was attentive, kind, and funny. Almost like she was dining with us. 10/10 Would recommend! Also, the crème brûlée was amazing (it’s homemade :)) Thank you T-Michaels!"

Cosette,50,"Delicious food, fantastic service.","What a wonderful place to dine. From the moment we stepped in the door of T-Michaels we were greeted with a friendly wait staff. We could see the room was quite busy, even then we were walked immediately to a table with an ocean view. The food was some of the best I’ve had in the city. If you are ever in search for an incredible Beef Wellington, come here! The owner was also there and he was very kind, making sure every table’s expectations were exceeded.  I will definitely come back!"

Cosette,50,A great evening at T-Michaels,"We were in to celebrate my husbands birthday. They had a table reserved for us by the window which is always perfect! We were greeted warmly and walked to our table by Tim, the manager. Our server was Kellie, who is always the best. She is super attentive and personable. Ty came by our table to check in on us and chat for a bit. The food was great, the drinks were delicious and the service was perfect. Everyone there made our evening extra special. Thank you Kellie, Tim and Ty"

Cosette,50,Great service and good,I give T Michaels a 5 star for sure. Been in the restaurant business for over 20 years. The best service and food I have had in awhile. Total professionals. The bartender who is also the bar manager was the most pleasant efficient and knowledgeable. A great spot for happy hour and dinner. Looking forward to my next visit.

Cosette,50,Best experience,"I had a great experience at T-Michaels, the food was excellent, our waitress was very professional. definitely a place I will return to"

Cosette,20,Lovely restaurant but.................,"I was encouraged to book a table here after reading so many favourable reviews on this site. The restaurant is very very nice with splendid waterfront views. We were met at reception, greeted very professionally and given a table adjacent to the windows. That's the good part, the rest was really poor. Our waitress was very attentive, but too familiar and had a dreadful habit of reaching across us to deposit or remove items from the table, ok in a diner, but not in a place like this. We both went for the steak and lobster. The lobster tail was disappointedly small, and the filet just ok but not great by any means. Overall, a very disappointing experience, especially as it ain't cheap.We will not return, we have dined in many places in our regular visits to Naples, and this establishment does not come close to places like Chops, Trulucks or Sea Salt, all of which have never failed to provide us with quality dinners."

Cosette,50,Very pleased!,The service was beyond amazing! We had a late reservation and they were still very attentive of us throughout our dinner. Drinks were delish and the beef Wellington was amazing!

Cosette,50,Great Steak & Seafood with spectacular service and views,"We had a wonderful dining experience last night at T-Michaels in Venetian Village. The four of us were greeted and seated by one of the many floor to ceiling windows as soon as we arrived. What a view! We have dined here before and we were lucky to get our favorite server, Kellie. She makes us feel right at home. With the helpful notes feature in Open Table, Kellie knew that we have one diner with dietary restrictions and had already spoken to the chef to seehow they could accommodate. She provided numerous options.  We started with a delicious bottle of Tempranillo. For starters we had a wedge salad, shrimp cocktail and the spinach and arugula salad. For dinner we had the bone in rib eye, filet mignon Oscar style, duck breast and a chopped salad. The meats were prepared exactly as requested. The sides to share included a twice baked stuffed potato, a sweet potato, a large serving of shrimp risotto and a large plate of asparagus. We finished off the dining experience with a T-Michael’s coffee, a Knobb Creek bourbon, carrot cake and a creme brûlée. Everything was delicious and we have leftovers to enjoy later. Definitely planning to go back again before the season starts!"

Cosette,50,Above and beyond,"After reading so many wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor, on Saturday night my wife and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary at T-Michael’s. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and were immediately seated at a table with an incredible water view.    The food and service were amazing! I had the lobster n steak and my wife had the perfectly cooked prime rib. (Pictured below). If you’re in town and looking for the very best steakhouse, run don’t walk to T Michael’s Steak and Lobster. Definitely 5 STAR"

Cosette,50,The sea bass was just as fantastic as Kellie the waitress!!!,Best risotto I have ever eaten in my life. FANTASTIC Chilean sea bass and the most delicious sauce over the mussels appetizer. Kellie the waitress was hand picked from heaven and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We went with All her recommendations are were thoroughly satisfied. 10/10 recommend!

Cosette,50,Celebrating my husband’s 80th Birthday!,"T Michaels  We celebrated my husband’s birthday at the restaurant yesterday; almost everything was better than expected. The view from our window table was excellent, although it required the assistance from our table attendant, Marco, who suggested a better table. Despite the fact we had requested a nice view on our reservation and the restaurant was almost empty. The food was amazing: the lobster cocktail unrivaled with an excellently prepared sauce. The Seafood trio was fresh, plentiful and nicely presented. The wine list had a well balanced selection with reasonable prices. Overall, a wonderful experience and special thanks to Marco for his excellent service and photography abilities."

Cosette,50,Amazing Dining Experience!,"T-Michael’s is our go to spot when visiting Naples/Marco Island. We recently went for dinner in early August and the food and service were spectacular!The steaks were amazing and cooked to perfection, and the seafood was super fresh and delicious! This restaurant always goes above and beyond to make sure your dining experience is top notch. We will most certainly be back!!"

Cosette,50,First Timers,Frederico was everything for my family and I. Food and service was superb. We will definitely be back.

Cosette,50,Beautiful waterfront dining!!!,"Brought some friends here for their first time and we are glad, and they are happy. With no snow birds in sight, with plenty of parking, water front table, a lot of elbow room during the off season, Marco was our server and we ordered a bottle of the Darioush Chardonnay and followed by four delish entrees.    For the ladies was a beef wellington, a prime rib and for the men a seafood trio, and a prime rib for me. Both prime ribs were a roasted perfection of medium rare. Seasoned perfectly, great taste, and tender. With a side of mashed potatoes and cream corn and we were happy. The beef wellington was baked in a nice crusty dough. The beef was a perfect medium and the seafood trio was as fresh as can be!!!    No room for dessert, just finishing up on the chardonnay and we were set.    Overall, this fine water front eatery is one of our favorites here in Naples. No crowds, plenty of parking, and stellar service!!!    We will be back!!!"

Cosette,50,"T Michael, divine dining!","T Michael’s was highly recommended to us. Our experience was over the top. From the time we entered to when we left, every sip, every bite was a delight!  Beef Wellington was perfect, side dish of lobster risotto complemented perfectly. We will definitely dine there again."

Cosette,50,Best of the Best!,"Our waitress Shenay made our experience unforgettable! My wife and I dined here for our anniversary. Everything from the hostess's kind greeting, the delicious food, the beautiful view, and Shenay's service blessed my wife and me tremendously."

Cosette,50,Great Happy Hour,"Another great night at T-Michael’s. Sat in the bar for it was Happy Hour (4-6:30). Had our favorite “prime steak tips” $17.00 & my wife had the chicken tacos $17.00. Reduced drink costs & ordered the Mac & lobster dish to go, $20.00! You can’t beat the HH here for great food at a decent price."

Cosette,50,Terrific views!,"Joe, our server, was amazing. He gave us great suggestion on the menu and was very attentive to our table. The Shrimp Sambal appetizer was worth the trip!"

Cosette,50,First visit,This restaurant was by far one of the best restaurants I’ve been to in a while. Hospitality was amazing and lucky us my party was able to me the owner amazing guy. If you’re in the Naples area check it out! Food and Customer service was 10/10!!

Cosette,50,Best in Naples!,"I’ve seen this place many many times, but have never stopped. We decided to go to celebrate a special occasion in Woweee. It did not disappoint. From the greeting at the front door to the service we received from Kory, it was the best dining experience we’ve had in Naples! The food quality was exceptional, we did not leave a single thing on any of our plates, even our butter dishes were clean as a whistle. We would highly recommend this restaurant from the service, food and views!"

Cosette,50,Great food with a beautiful view of the water.,"We went to T Michael's for the 1st time and we absolutely loved it! The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. The service was phenomenal, Lucy took great care of us! The views while dining were beautiful. Definitely going back! Can't wait to have the shrimp risotto and porterhouse steak again."

Cosette,50,T Michaels is fantastic!!!!,"This restaurant is absolutely amazing!!! Do not miss it. We went for Happy Hour and enjoyed delicious cocktails, prime tenderloin steak tips, calamari and Shrimp Sambal. All were exceptional. And the service was outstanding - be sure to make this a priority when in Naples. You will be happy you did."

Cosette,50,Great service & good,"We dined here May 25th during dinner for the first time, we were sat by the water with one of the most beautiful views in naples, we ordered the mussels & calami for appetizers which were delicious, the sauce on the mussels was excellent, I couldn’t have enough. Our server Kellie was one of the best if not the best server I have ever dinned with, she was super attentive, knowledgeable and nice. Overall a great and relaxing experience, would definitely recommend this restaurant."

Cosette,50,Magical Evening at T-Michael’s from start to finish,"5/23/2023  My friend is a professional chef from NJ. She and her husband owned/recently sold their Italian restaurant and came to visit us in Naples. I was afraid they would be disappointed with the restaurants here because their epicurean bar is set so high. After careful consideration we went to one of our old favorites, T-Michael's Steak and Lobster House. The panoramic floor to ceiling window views are spectacular. We often enjoy dolphins feasting on their own dinner in the bay while enjoying ours, esp at sunset. The owner, Ty, always remembers our names and treats everyone like a valued guest. His staff is professional and attentive. We enjoyed their signature appetizer, Shrimp Sambal while perusing the menu. These are no ordinary shrimp and not to be missed. Jumbo, juicy, fresh and the creative marriage of flavors is bellisimo! My friend ordered 10 oz twin lobster tails and her husband ordered the Beef Wellington. They could not shed enough praise on their melt-in-your-mouth entrees plus three delicious sides that we shared: sautéed mushrooms, creamed spinach and Boursin mashed potatoes, all so very delicious! Although I am not as big of an eater, my 10 oz lobster tail was beautifully prepared and a pleasure to eat. I had a forkful of my husband's blackened salmon teriyaki...awesomely good. I am a Cabernet lover, which is the most important part of the meal for me. The thoughtful wine selection has all my favorites, which is not true of any other restaurant I have come across in Naples. My friend is not a Cabernet drinker and asked Ty to recommend a drink. After deciding on a margarita, Ty took the time to bring her the ""Millionaire's Margarita."" Kevin, the experienced bartender did not disappoint. That margarita looked magical as if it was liquid gold with pixie dust swirling in her glass. I never had a margarita I liked....until that night! And the espresso martinis, yum! I could not have chosen more wisely. T-Michael's is the bomb! One last thing: ya can't have dinner with a chef and not indulge in dessert, right? We really went overboard ordering the crème brûlée, carrot cake and apple pie Ala mode. OMG, worth every calorie. Don't skip dessert! Life is too short! I am only disappointed I was so busy enjoying everything we don't have more pics of the food to share. Our server, Maddie was phenomenal and took great care of us even though we were among the last to leave."

Cosette,50,Best restaurant in Naples,"Incredible dinner ! Steak cooked to perfection. Scallops as an appetizer were to die for. And joe the Waiter cemented a perfect night: attentive, spot-on recommendations. Thank you for an incredible night"

Cosette,50,Best Restaurant in Naples,"A family favorite! Can’t have a trip here without visiting T. Michael’s. The best food and environment. Kellie was our waitress this trip and was top tier. She was so attentive and went out of her way to make our experience extra delightful. The owner always make it a point to say hello and check in on us every visit. Our Naples favorite… until next time, T. Michael’s."

Cosette,50,Birthday Dinner at T Michael’s!!!,"So many lovely things happened in one night,Upon arrival my spouse and I were greeted with a warm engaging smile by Ty the manager (what a lovely guy he is)…It was my spouse birthday so I booked a window table..The view was absolutely breathtaking and the service was exceptional, Shanae was our girl..Very sweet and extremely professional!!!! Her knowledge about the menu was A1…We had the Beef Wellington and twin lobster tails with spinach on the side,everything was extremely fresh and was served with a smile..Ordered a bottle of Vueve Cliquot and had the most amazing experience..Oh don’t forget to order a coconut crusted desert,best desert I’ve ever tasted..Thank you T michaels staff for the great service!!! We will return!"

Cosette,10,Horrible food,"Probably the worst place to eat in Naples , food was bad all the way around. Thanks for who put 4.5 stars. You cost me time and money to eat junk"

Cosette,50,YUM,"I had steak,my husband a porterhouse steak and it was so tender and seasoned and cooked to perfection.  We sat at the bar and had a few cocktails. Cory for our waitress who was very attentive and Kevin as our bartender,he mixed the best drinks in town. We love it there!"

Cosette,50,Amazing service and great food.,"The Food was amazing, our server Madi was by far the best waitress I’ve ever had. This is definitely a place we will come back to multiple times."

Cosette,50,"Wonderful service, good and view !",We had such a lovely family dinner for my sister’s university graduation! Kellie was an amazing server and was very attentive and so friendly always going above and beyond. She gave great recommendations. The ambience was unmatched and the view was beautiful. We will definitely love to come back when we are back in town!

Cosette,50,A great evening.,"My wife and I had an amazing evening at T Michael’s. First, we were greeted nicely as we entered the building and were seated at the window with a beautiful view. The dining area is open and somewhat quiet. The decor is nice with white table clothes.    Our server, Kelly, was extremely nice, knowledgeable and patient. She quickly brought us our drinks. My martini was excellent. She brought us an appetizer of shrimp which were perfect. She explained the menu items and recommended the snapper special, which my wife loved. My filet was cooked perfectly.    We had a wonderful time and both felt this was the best of the 10 restaurants we have been at so far on our two week vacation.    Great food, a nice dining are, a fine view and a great server, Kelly, made this a special evening.  Oh, I need to mention the owner, or GM, who greeted us at the door and went to all tables to speak with the guests.    Give T Michael’s a try."

Cosette,50,Great experience!,"This was our first visit and we’ll definitely be back! Our server, Joe, was first class all the way! I even got the dessert he suggested and he was right on - Lave cake with peanut butter gelato! The apple pie was incredible, too. Our dinners were outstanding, def recommend this restaurant! Great view, too!"

Cosette,50,6 Star League!,"This was the first time that my husband and I dined at T-Michaels and it was by far, the best meal and service we’ve had in Naples all season long. We were so delighted with the overall ambiance and the stunning waterside view. The food was exceptional, with our steaks prepared perfectly Oscar style. To our surprise, that meant it came topped with an entire crab cake vs. usual crabmeat pieces in Bernaise sauce. Definitely a mouth watering wow factor! Our server, Korey, provided excellent service from beginning to end. She was friendly, attentive, and responsive towards all our first time questions and needs. Because of the superior dining experience there, we already booked a reservation again and see ourselves becoming regular guests there in the future. Why settle for mediocre when you can have the best at T-Michaels?!?!"

Cosette,50,"Thank you, Kellie!","Food is outstanding. Nice view and ambiance. Our server was Kellie. She is delightful, attentive and very professional. Oh.. did I mention she also has a witty sense of humor."

Daniel,50,Sublime Dining Experience,"This was not just an amazing dinner, it was a sublime experience. Went with three friends after an opening and simply everything about the evening was beyond any expectation. We all had the four-course tasting menu: innovative, surprising, and supremely delicious. Wine pairings were heaven. But moreover, the beauty of the space along with the knowledge, helpfulness, friendliness, and professionalism of all the staff made for a joyous and unforgettable evening. Thank you to Daniel and everyone who work so hard to make this place what it is - iconic."

Daniel,40,Nice dinner,"A four of us visited Daniel and we had a great dining experience. Most of the dishes were amazing (a couple -the abalone and, surprisingly, the duck courses- were not great). The wine pairings were outstanding. We did the premium pairing, and it was simply the best pairing we ever experienced anywhere. A big thanks to the sommeliers! The staff were very friendly. Thank you Evan and “Captain America” for making our night."

Daniel,50,Elegant dining,Beautiful dining room setting for an equally polished tasting menu. We enjoyed all courses and it was very well presented. By far the best preparation of duck we’ve ever had. The tilefish and vichyssoise were also highlights of the meal.

Daniel,30,"Underwhelming, resting on laurels",What a disappointment! Canapés tasted bad except for soup. Foie gras terrine was minuscule and overwhelmed by chutney. Sea bass was messily plated and tasted bland. Striploin was fatty. Dessert was OK. Server felt unpolished and couldn’t describe a certain dish’s sauce. Didn’t top off waters. Didn’t feel as refined as it once did. Won’t return

Daniel,40,Love it,Really nice restaurant. We usually go there when in town. Location is cozy and the food always surprises us!

Daniel,40,Mostly positive experience!,"My husband and I are foodies and have enjoyed creative menus at many restaurants across the U.S. We had the tasting menu at Daniel and enjoyed the experience. Some of the courses may have been a little bland while others excited our palettes. Overall it was a worthwhile experience. However, one of the waitstaff had horrific gas and made our dining experience less desirable because of it. I was completely disgusted at times. Note to staff: please stay home if you can’t hold your flatulence. We paid almost $1k for dinner and occasionally nearly threw up from the smell. This was hopefully a one off due to a careless waiter."

Daniel,50,Definitely still my favorite!,"I love coming back to Daniel. This is only my 3rd visit as I live in San Francisco, CA. We visit NYC almost once a year for the past 5 years and I do try my best to visit despite that there are other Michelin starred restaurants in NYC which I have not been.    My first experience here was back in 2016 or 2018 which made such an impression making it my favorite Michelin starred restaurant. Been to Per Se twice, Chef’s Table at Brooklyn, Eleven Madison, Le Bernadin, Gabriel Kreuther twice, Jean George, Aquavit, Crown Shy and one of my all time favorites - Joel Robuchon. I love fine-dining and so I make an extra effort to visit the Michelin starred restaurants in NYC. Daniel is very special to me and so made it here 3x.    Last night’s dinner was amazing! We went for the Chef’s Tasting Menu with the supplement of foie gras for me and hubby. Every dish was delicious except the main course which was duck. It was perfectly cooked in medium rare but the sauce was too salty. Had to take the skin out and just consumed the meat which turned out ok. The food presentations were just as colorful, eye-catching and beautiful. Dining at Daniel truly exudes fine-dining at its best. The art hung beautifully in every wall were a bit too bold and a bit distracting. I preferred the old Daniel with a bit subtlety with their arts. I miss the beautiful huge art hung by the front entrance and was told it was sold. I was sad upon hearing as I was looking forward to seeing again.l    Matthew and Rodri waited on us. Both gentlemen waited on us with great patience and care. Matthew was so accommodating and made sure we were well taken care of despite that he was so busy with other guests. Rodri, on the other hand, was just as accommodating and very helpful. He was very attentive to say the least. His beautiful smile simply warmed our hearts. We were blessed to have the two men served us. Thank you, guys!  We definitely would love to come back again in the future."

Daniel,30,"OK food, service not at the level of a 2 M","Good food, staff and service not at the level of a 2 Michelin star restaurant , lack of attention to details"

Daniel,50,"WOW, just WOW","If you want to splurge on a fine dining experience, with excellent food, where you leave full and don't feel bad about the price at the end of your meal, definitely visit Daniel. The service is top notch, the food is just a WOW, every single dish, just outstanding. The drinks were excellent, the desserts, sublime. The atmosphere is romantic and serene, without being dark, yet you can celebrate loudly here as well, just a great place to experience at least once in your life."

Daniel,50,Stellar,"Daniel has never disappointed us. It continues to excel in service, food and ambiance. There aren’t many fine dining restaurants left in NYC that still deliver the element of elegance and detail offered at Daniel. The sommelier was excellent. She chose some really good Burgundies. Food and presentation were stellar. Daniel is a true fine dining destination."

Daniel,50,An absolute must try in NYC,"This is an absolute must if you visit New York! Food is out of this world, and so is the wine pairing. The service is as good as it gets. I go back every time I visit this marvelous city."

Daniel,50,"For an out of this world experience, nothing beats Daniels!!!","I have been going to Daniels since it opened at this incredible location. The chef, who owns many restaurants, lives in the building, and most people who know him, say this is his favorite of all his restaurants.    It is simply amazing in every way..definitely a very special occasion place, and very expensive, but is it worth it...ABSOLUTELY YES.....ONE OF THE TOP FIVE RESTAURANTS IN NYC (In my personal opinion, it is number one!!)......for an out of this world experience, nothing beats Daniels!!!"

Daniel,50,A Top Restaurant In NYC,"We enjoyed most every dish on the menu, including the ""vichyssoise,"" the Summer Greens,the black sea bass, veal, and chocolate desserts, particularly the one with the crackers. The quail was not of the same high standard as the other dishes, nor was the passion fruit dessert. Service was excellent. The wine list is expensive with the cheaper bottles around $120, and hardly any good bottles at that price point. The setting is pretty, and the sound level is low."

Daniel,50,For a very special night this is the place….don’t get bullied by the wine list choose value for money …,Very expensive but not overpriced…everything about this restaurant is 5 star…from start to finish.The only issue I have is the restrooms are too far away and down what I class as dangerous stairs for older people especially after a drink or two.

Daniel,50,Wonderful Dining Experience,"If you want a wonderful dining experience, this is the place to go to. We ate in the Lounge rather then the dining room. The Lounge is quieter and you can order as much or as little as you want. The staff was fabulous and very accommodating."

Daniel,50,A Special Treat,"From the moment you walk through the door, this establishment impresses. We arrived a bit early for our reservation and had cocktails in the lounge, which is pleasant and intimate. Upon entering the dining room, the decor impresses—what an atmosphere! We had the chef’s tasting menu, which included about 7 courses, each one well prepared and plated to perfection. The service staff was outstanding from the captain to servers and the floor manager, who chatted with us and was very accommodating. This restaurant fully deserves its Michelin stars. It is a special treat!"

Daniel,50,What a Night!,A friend back home recommended we have dinner at Restaurant Daniel - I am so grateful for the recommendation. What an exquisite evening. Service was wonderful - attentive but not intrusive. The food was amazing. We had a reservation in the Lounge and ordered from the al a carte menu. A special thanks to Pascal and Flavio - they were wonderful.

Daniel,30,"Style over substance, offering poor value for money. Great service and presentation though…","Went back after 20 years as it was the highlight of my previous visit. Sadly I was disappointed.  Service was good, and presentation was fantastic. However some of the dishes lacked flavour, a bit style over substance. Also having to wear a jacket for dinner at the height of summer is somewhat stuffy and other Michelin starred restaurants have moved with the times.  Tasting menu at $275 with matched wines at $175 per head also meant value for money was sadly lacking on this occasion. I think you could get better food elsewhere for a lot less."

Daniel,50,A Beautiful New York Michelin Experience,"I have been to a few Michelin Star restaurants now and they have all blown my mind away, this one does the exact same thing. I, as well as my friend, got the four-course menu and were full by the end of it, with all the extra little things they bring out you won't go home hungry! The best part about this dinner wasn't the meal, even though it was superb, it was the service that stood out. Our server Jhonatan was on top of everything, making sure we really had that two Michelin Star experience. Lastly, if you are getting the four-course menu, the second-course foie gras is a must!"

Daniel,50,One of our favorite restaurants in the world!,"Daniel is one of our favorite restaurants not just in NYC, but in the world. The food is creative, beautiful and tastes sublime! One of the most talented chefs anywhere. The service and atmosphere are both top tier as well. Expensive but worth it."

Daniel,50,"Fabulous, superlative, worth the price","Every dish was divine. Superb service, quiet for a busy place, vegetables accompanying each dish were also special. Don't miss this for a special occasion, splurge. One picks 4 dishes from each of 4 columns. And they provide extra amuse bouche and desserts too."

Daniel,50,30 Years later only the Best,"30 years later still the Best  Same Chef , same quality service , same 3 ***food , we feel like home  Only go unfortunately every fews years  But always impress by the consistency and the improvements of the fous and service  It’s call perfection  See you soon"

Daniel,50,Magical Evening,"A one-of-a-kind evening at Restaurant Daniel for our final night in NYC.  Excellent service from the bar staff and restaurant servers.  Thank you for adjusting the tasting menu to our dietary requirements.  Very special evening.  And when they say 9 courses, expect a lot more than 9!"

Daniel,50,Best server!,He was so sweet and very patient we had 3 young kids with us! Amazing customer service! Best server!

Daniel,30,"For their sake, I’m glad I wasn’t the Michelin inspector!","The welcome was very friendly and as I waited for my guests I ordered a glass of champagne and mentioned to the lady serving me that we would like to have a drink in the lounge before dinner. She said that was fine and as my guests arrived she took an order for drinks. When she walked off we were approached by another waitress who asked us to go to our table. I explained that we had just ordered an aperitif and would proceed to our table when we were finished. She then very sternly stated that we had to go to the table as our booking was for 5pm and if we wanted to have a drink we should have arrived before 5. I protested but she insisted the we had to stand up and go into the dining room.  Rather than have the situation descend into an unseemly row we did as we were told and then went in to our table.  The first waitress then followed us in with our three glasses of champagne and was. surprised that we had left the lounge. I explained what had happened and she expressed surprise at this and reaffirmed that we could have had our drink in the lounge first. At this stage we weren’t going to leave the table again and go back out.  We were then waiting 15 minutes before anyone gave us a menu - 15 minutes that could have been spent in the lounge enjoying our aperitif.    The dinner service was very good but certainly rushed. We were constantly having to apologise to our waiter as he was not really giving us enough time to choose, constantly interrupting the conversation.  The food was good but not superb as you would expect.  Perhaps it was the rushed nature of the service meant we couldn’t really relax.  We went for the wine pairing ( the more expensive one) and when we got our first course the first wine had not arrived. I had to ask someone to organise this wine and eventually it arrived when we were nearly finished the first course.  I had the squash veloute and it was Luke warm- almost cold.  The next two courses and the desert were all very good but certainly not 2 star. It all felt too rushed anyway.    There were some nice touches like the canele to take home and the other little treat with our coffee. However two of us ordered cappuccino’s and they were dreadful. More like milky flat whites with little coffee and loads of milk. Again Luke warm.  During the entire meal we were never once asked were we enjoying it. We never say any management type person or maitre d. If we were I would have raised these concerns privately with him/her before posting here.    So all in all a mediocre experience and I fear that if I had been a diner from the Michelin guide, that would not have turned out well.  To top things off the fire alarm went off as we had just paid our bill. There was a siren and lights flashing. The restaurant was full. While, of course this can happen, there was no attempt to engage with the diners to either reassure them or evacuate them.  We left - we were going anyway - we asked the staff about the alarm which had been going on now for a few minutes. They had nothing to say.  As we left, two fire trucks were arriving and the firefighters were entering the restaurant with their oxygen masks and hatchets.  I’d love to know what unfolded but we didn’t hang around.  A lovely setting and very good food but Daniel Boulud needs to keep an eye on the detail or they will soon start slipping in the rankings."

Daniel,50,Still the best,"Its been a while since our last visit due to pandemic and some health issues, but this restaurant continues to shine when there is so much disappointment in the dining out experience. The sense of arrival is always professional and friendly, not intimidating, opening up to a magnificent dining area. We were not satisfied with our original table and were quickly moved to a great table, no questions asked. Service was prompt, as always, and you sometimes lost who was your actual server due to the attentiveness of staff. Foo was spectacular. I had scallops, sole, lamb, and apple pie. Sounds pretty straight forward, but it was anything but that. Each presentation outdid the next in design and taste, aided by once again by impeccable service. I admonished my wife for taking pictures of each item, but couldn't blame her. If there is a more delightful dining experience, I don't know where to find it. Drinks were equally good.and they pour a good country club amount. We love this restaurant and would highly recommend it to everyone. It is expensive, but you most certainly get what you pay for."

Daniel,50,Love this Place,Truly wonderful experience visiting this place. We loved everything from the food to the ambiance to the service. Thank you for a unforgettable night.

Daniel,40,Great services and amazing environment,"The staff and services are excellent. The bar and restaurant are amazing, great environment. The food is good but not impressive."

Daniel,50,"Open again, still outstanding","I have been a frequent client of Danielle for decades and just had dinner this weekend. They did not disappoint. It is outstanding, the decor, food, service, treatment of clients."

Daniel,50,So Much Food,"Daniel is a perfect place to go if you have a big appetite, a luxuriously long evening, and much to talk about. Go on an empty stomach! The prix fixe is 4 courses, not including a small starter dish, elaborate bread, chocolates with dessert, fresh baked lemon madeleines, and a pocket-sized cake to take home. Everything was rich in flavor and portioned just right, and the meal is paced so that each course stands on it's own while also opening your palette (and stomach) to more. It's expensive, but for 2 Michelin stars, it's in the same price range as other restaurants with only 1 star and gives more bang for your buck. Wear something loose around the stomach and go hungry!"

Daniel,50,Fantastic dinner,"There is a lot of hype about Daniel but it fully lived up to the reputation. Took my twin adult daughters with their spouse for their birthday.    Food and service were phenomenal. Sommelier David, although extremely busy, took the time to discuss wine with us numerous times during the evening. Fois Gras was as good as it gets.    Obviously not cheap, but you know that going in. For a special occasion or to treat yourself, you cannot beat it."

Daniel,50,I loved it.,"The food was great, perfectly cooked and well presented and they have a great wine list. Great thanks to the chef at the hot station (meats).Very nice service will be back."

Daniel,50,Haute Cuisine,Expensive and worth it. Have been here with my wife and daughter on separate occasions and the service s expert and charming. The room is beautiful.

Daniel,10,Epic Fail,"Took my daughter here for Thanksgiving dinner. I told her she was going to one of the best restaurants in the world! Granted, I haven't been to Daniel in almost 20 years but THAT was a memorable meal complete with a picture with Chef himself. Reviews were still good so yes, off we went to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner, or so we thought. 8:00 reservation, which we showed up at 7:45. At first, they tried to squeeze us in the lounge next to a couple and their child on the same couch! I said I'd wait for a table to be cleaned. I inquired if they had any zero proof wines. The waiter never came back. After the second waiter loudly and shortly said ""NO"" when I flagged him down to order, my daughter ordered a lemonade and I a zero proof cocktail. The lemonade was 'lemon juice' and the zero proof cocktail was grapefruit juice. For a restaurant with the accolades they have, they are missing the mark here big time. So again, reservation was for 8pm, we were seated, kid you not, 8:55 pm. They obviously overbooked. Our 'cocktail' since we were never approached again in the lounge were not comped, however I said I was not paying for the lemon juice. We were seated at a very nice center table for two in the dining room, however, I have to mention the decor. It needs'something'. It's not traditional because of the painting in the rear, yet it's not modern or contemporary. It really needs an over haul. The red carpet leading down to the bathroom has tears in places. This place just is not what it used to be. It was VERY elegant before. So, onto the food. We attempted to order another round of cocktails, this time, just asking if they could make virgin mojitos. They did, not bad after I asked for a side of simple syrup, they were good. I ended up ordering another one later and the bartender must have changed because it came out perfect with the right amount of bubbles. We were not given much choice for the meal. It was 4 courses. The appetizers consisted of a salad, scallops, salmon and one other. We opted for the salad with smoked ricotta. The salad was okay. It was very pretty to look at, but no amazing dressing and the ricotta did not taste smoked, no big deal, but that was that, no big deal. The bread roll I picked was a little brioche roll and it was delicious. We were given two potato like tater tots, not bad with caviar which were pretty good and a trio of carrot somethings. Good, but nothing to write home about. My daughter liked them. We opted for the pasta with truffles supplement. At approx $120, we received 8 noodles. It was good, could have used a little salt with those truffles, but that was the best part of the meal and the truffles weren't amazing, but the pasta was very good. The $120 price tag didn't bother me if it was a 'portion' of pasta, but c'mon, pasta is $1/ box. When you have the balls to charge that for a supplement, throw some more noodles in. There were more truffles than noodles. On to the main course. We had a choice of Thanksgiving Dinner, tilefish, salmon or a pork chop. That was disappointing. We both opted for Thanksgiving dinner and boy did we go wrong. When you start seeing words like bouquet or something like it, watch out. The picture looks gorgeous of our meal. It was two somehow processed slices of turkey (seemed like it was ground mixed, put back together in a ball, cooked and sliced) which came with a few hard pieces of garnish on top of what I can only describe as burnt pan drippings. It was like a dog treat. The meal came with a tablespoon of vegetables, tart like berries which were good-the only good thing on the plate, stuffing that was more ground up meat than stuffing and a green ball which was stuffed with more meat. I did not understand this ground meat plate at all. We gobbled the berries, fished out the veggie pieces and left the rest. My daughter likened the meat on the dish which was 99 percent of the meal to our new puppy's food, which is a human grade cooked ground meal of meat and a few veggies. I laughed because she was right. At this point I want to mention the service. As soon as we sat down an hour after our scheduled time, I told our waiter that we were not interested the 'dining experience', that they did not have to wait in between courses to bring the food and he was great. Water was filled, they were attentive, MUCH different to the lounge service. So at this point, I'm like bring on the dessert. After the lack luster salad, my portion of the 4 truffle noodles and the doggy like Thanksgiving dinner, all I could think of was a decadent dessert. I told the waiter, whatever is chocolate we will take. There was a pear option, an apple option and what sounded like a chocolate option. We chose chocolate. Out came our dessert which one can best describe as a chocolate covered jelly ring (yes in the jewish section of the grocery store) topped with a tasteless chocolate mousse and unsweetened phyllo dough pieces?, not sure. It was beyond lack luster. Not even the chocolates at the end of the meal were chocolates. You can see them pictured next to the dessert. One was made with sweet potato and not sure of the other. We need received the powdered cookies, but we did receive the bill which was just over $1k with gratuity. For that kind of money, I expect a LOT more. The previous nights we dined at Le Bernadin and Gabriel Kreuther and not only were we stuffed to the gills with amazing dishes, one after the other, it was about $750 for chef's tasting (around 10 dishes each) compared to the 4 for $1k of pre-made garbage. Sorry, Daniel, you sorely got that whole evening wrong. I would not recommend going to this restaurant at all. Value for money is very poor. A name is only a name until it's not."

Daniel,10,OK at best,"Decent meal, nothing to write home about. We asked multiple waiters to get a photo with Chef Daniel and we were told he didn't want to meet with us. He was literally going around to tables taking photos with other patrons."

db Bistro Moderne,50,Great experience,"Great ambience with fresh seafood, attentive & friendly staff, Rain. She gave very good recommendations of the food too."

db Bistro Moderne,40,Good food. Good service.,Nice ambience and background music. Good food and portion. Love the lobster bisque. Very fresh oysters. Attentive service by Ray. Unique Maedeline for birthday on the house Will be back.

db Bistro Moderne,50,"Great service, Great food","Wonderful dinner at DB..  Nicely greeted on arrival, and food is great! Had Onion soup with rich layer of cheese, so alike to what I had in France  The trout was great too well done with no fishy taste to it.    Great service by Reynaldo who is very attentive and good recommendations too on the cheese to pick for the 3-pc platter.    Thanesh the sommelier was also very knowledgeable and skilled when opening the bottles    Thanks db for the wonderful evening"

db Bistro Moderne,50,Birthday celebration,"Mitch and Sheryl provided exceptional service and we will definitely be back 🤩 We had a memorable birthday celebration, highly recommended! Thank you 😍"

db Bistro Moderne,50,One of the best!,Great for both casual/date/celebratory nights. Superb service and one of the best hospitality experiences that one can have. No regrets.

db Bistro Moderne,50,Great atmosphere for drinks,"Db Bistro has always been known for its impressive seafood platters.  But tucked behind the display at the entrance, is the bar that I think is quite a hidden gem.  With a much more intimate vibe, it's always a better place to hang out and have a chat compared to the main dining area.  Besides the fantastic drinks, you can also order subset of the main food menu at the bar.  Service is top notch and the bartenders are friendly and engaging.  Overall, very enjoyable experience, will definitely be back again!"

db Bistro Moderne,50,Excellent Dinning Experience,"Walked in for dinner in a Thursday night with my friend and we was thoroughly impressed by both the exquisite cuisine and the impeccable service. The menu showcased a variety of innovative dishes, blending bold flavors and beautiful presentation. Staff Aria- she was attentive, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable ensured that our meal was a memorable one, providing excellent recommendations and ensuring our satisfaction. I can’t recommend DB Bistro enough for a fantastic dining experience.”"

We highly recommend the DB burger and steak tartare."

db Bistro Moderne,50,The beat experience,The best special cocktails by Ace and great service by Thedy and JC. Food was delicious and great value for money. Julyn and Erica’s hospitality was remarkable.

Deux Amis,10,"Help yourself, avoid this place!","Help yourself, avoid this place! Awful overpriced food and drinks, worst service ever… Help yourself, avoid this place!"

Deux Amis,50,"Great vibe, great food and great natural wine.",Had a wonderful night here with some great natural wines and tasty sharing plates. There was a great atmosphere and the place was packed.

Deux Amis,20,Horrible service,Food and drink were admittedly very good but the service was probably the worst I‘ve ever experienced. The servers turn openly hostile on a whim. The level of arrogance is unmatched. Someone needs to remind the ‚amis‘ that it’s about hospitality and not hostility.

Deux Amis,50,Good food,This place is a must in paris to eat. They have a nice selection of food to share with your company. The natural wine was a little bit dissapointed. Good mood over je place and almost only locals over there!

Deux Amis,40,Nice wine bar with knowledgeable staff,"Quite a lively place in the evening with a good range of wines to suit all tastes (though with a heavy weighting towards ""natural wines"") and staff who are quite savvy."

Deux Amis,40,"We went for just drinks and snacks, but there was much more","We went early in the evening, around 5 or 6, and so it was pretty chill and mostly neighborhood folks grabbing a glass and a snack. We did the same, trying some of their beers, sausage, cheese, peppers, and bread. All very good. Bartenders were very friendly. It seems they and the market next door work together? The chef is American, I believe, and was working on that night's specials on a pad with the staff and the lady next door from the market. I wish we could have stayed -- everything sounded great! Only real downside was a relatively limited beer menu (not unusual for France) and one tap refused to work. :) That, and they seemed to be having a gnat problem but the place looked very, very clean."

Deux Amis,50,Just go!,"This place will restore your faith in humanity! If the delicious food and thirst quenching natural wines aren't enough to lift your spirits (in this morally bankrupt world) - the staff and the patrons will bring you the rest off the way! Go forth, drink, eat and be merry!!!"

Deux Amis,40,Delicious tapas in a great bar setting,"We stopped by on the recommendation of a friend. Loved the casual bar atmosphere (including the beautiful copper bar). The chorizo and sausage were both excellent, the wine was tasty and the service was friendly. It got busy after we arrived so we were lucky to score a table. Best arrive around 7pm to get a spot. Definitely worth checking out!"

Deux Amis,30,Good but expensive,"I saw this piece change in the last few years... I just remembered why I didn't go since a while. Ok service, wine is good but expensive food. Its ok for a drink but the tapas are way too expensive. You can find other choices around and have a proper dinner for a deceit price. The overall experience was ok."

Deux Amis,50,My Favorite Lunch Spot in Paris,My first meal in Paris is always this place. Phenomenal tapas-style food. Great wines. Small place that mainly appeals to locals which is what I love as a tourist. I wanna go where the Parisians go!

Deux Amis,50,Get the local experience.,"Very crowded, very fun place that mostly attracts locals. Excellent wine selection (organic) and splendid small plates."

Deux Amis,50,"Lunch was amazing, tapas not bad either","We had our first lunch in Paris in the tiny restaurant. It looks ordinary, but the food they are putting out is amazing. We tried everything (savory) on the menu and loved it all - bonito, onglet of beef, asparagus salad. And, when we went back later in our visit for dinner we enjoyed the tapas and wine as well (it's quite a bit more crowded at lunch)."

Deux Amis,30,Pre-dinner stop,"A very local establishment, it is small with a great bar vibe. We manage to get a (literally) small table by the entrance. Food is in the form of tapas - so expect small portions. Well made, nicely presented but all in small bites accompanied with good wine. Good energy with lots of locals. Great if you are seeking a small bite (literally) before your actual dinner at 10pm."

Deux Amis,30,A little pricey,My girlfriend and I went for lunch. We found the place to be a bit pricey compared to the quality. The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

Deux Amis,50,Excellent!,"I visited this place for the first time in September, and I have already been back three times! Just great.    The service is really personal and great, not a given for Paris. The food is simple but always exiting, fresh and soo tasty. Fun, lively and cosy atmosphere.    The concept is small sharing plates which change from day to day. There is usually a lift wait for a table, especially if your more than two. But the waiters will gladly try to squeeze you in at the bar, or let you stand by their station (as i did once) and have a glass of wine and some cheese/ham. I have seen that they do reservations at times, but not sure if its just for the insiders.    Really amazing place. everyone i have taken here has loved it. Really ranks as one of the best overall restaurant experiences i have had!"

Deux Amis,50,Great restaurant!!,We were referred here by a waited from Lili et Riton restaurant (by Edgar quinet station) as a local french haunt. Was amazing!! They have a brilliant selection of spectacular organic wines and an ever changing modern french tapa menu. The black pudding with pear and cress was sublime! The seared duck with figs was also brilliant. Not touristy but they are very very accommodating! They will give you a selection of plates that they pick for you (without ripping you off - $40 Euro for food between two pretty good for Paris!!). Highly recommended especially if you want to see modern french with the locals!!

Deux Amis,30,"Decent food, repulsive service",The food is tasty but for the price it should come with good service. There are so many other good restaurants with friendly service nearby that you should save your money and your mood by going elsewhere.

Deux Amis,40,"Great food, and stick to it.","I was unsure on what to order, and things are handwritten so Google Translate would not work on the menu. Despite this however, I was made to feel very welcome and I was able to ask my server for the 3 best Tapas. I got a mackerel dish with peas, and that was my favorite. Then a pan seared steak fillet, served blue and that was incredible and finally a squid dish (which is very intense), called Nior something. It is Black rice with squid. The beers on tap however were served in very small glasses and are charged at 4 euros a glass. If you are used to drinking a pint of beer with a meal that will cost quite a bit so just stick to the food, until their beer prices are more fair. I almost said something."

Deux Amis,30,You'll have to stay at the bar if you won't have dinner,"And I really mean it! A couple tapas won't be enough. You'll have to stay standing at the bar with barely anough room to get a sip from your glass, because the place is usually so incredibly crowded (even on weekdays)!  Try to sit at one of the tables and you'll immediately be told ""we're keeping tables for diners""  Basically, you need to reserve and/or spend enough to be worthy of being seated.  But, hey, this is not a ""restaurant"" it is a wine BAR!  The wine, although organic, is just OK, with choices of (in my opinion) lesser wines from the south of France, and little choice. No cotes du Rhone, no bordeaux, no cahors... So you'll be missing all the good stuff...  The tortilla was ok. My friend had the grilled sardine, which he absolutely loved."

Deux Amis,40,"Simple bistrot fare, French tapas and organic wines",I had lunch with a friend there Christmas Eve. Good appetizers and a simple entrecôte with potatoes and ending with a orange salad as dessert. Quite a 'bobo' place but good quality food. Worth it if u in the area.

Django,50,Des Moines Business Trip,"Went on a Tuesday for their HH. Sat at the bar and enjoyed the charcuterie board, oysters, poutine and delicious drinks! Will definitely be back!"

Django,20,Great restaurant but customer service needs work..,"Ive seen this restaurant quite often when strolling downtown. i thought i’d give it a try. On this past Monday, i called to reserve a table and the hostess; i think her name was Mariah.? was rushing me over the phone. which i wasn’t too worried about.. but when i showed up later that day, the hostess seemed extremely unorganized and confused on my reservation.. i will say the food was amazing and would probably consider coming again. but the hostess made it seem like she didn’t want to be there and that kind of ruined the vibe for the first half and my friends visiting weren’t too fond of it either. The rest of the staff was great with smiles on their faces! our server was great! no complaints on her or the food!"

Django,40,Dinner at Django,Had dinner at Django in downtown Des Moines - Service was good -food was good overall French restaurant enjoyed out dinner

Django,50,Des Moines Highlight,"Easy parking, great food, prompt service, and decent price for quality French food. We went twice it was so good. Their beef just melts in your mouth."

Django,30,4 star not yet,"My wife and i went to Django a few years ago and it was excellent. We rarely get to get to Des Moines so when the opportunity arose we decided to go there again. our waitress was excellent and we ordered drinks, the old fashioned was good not great, the pina colada similar with high abv was good. We ordered the calamari, the coating was light and the appetizer was very good. This is where the meal fell apart. My wife ordered the fillet and i ordered the duck. The duck was good . the fillet and the potatoes were cold. It seemed to me that her steak was on the pass too long. Its a shame that the meals weren't coordinated like they should have been. This restaurant wants to be a 4 star place but it's just not there yet."

Django,50,Great Gem in Downtown,Reviews sounded great so I gave it a try and boy was I glad I came in. Great Bourbon selection including Weller’s!! Beef tartare with fresh bread was a great starter. Went with pork Chop and it was very delicious. Great choice and very to close to my hotel. Super cool place to eat!!

Django,50,One of the best restaurants in Des Moines!,"Django is perfect for anyone visiting Des Moines. The ambiance is great, especially since it's right across from the sculpture garden and the menu has something for everyone: excellent steaks, seafood, poutine, even burgers and salads.    You can't go wrong with the beef tartare, mussels and lamb papparedelle. Love their au poive sauce on a filet too. We visit many times a year. They also have nice mocktails for the non-drinkers."

Django,50,Who imagined such a great seafood meal would be in Iowa?!,"Absolutely lovely meal tonight! Lengthy and interesting wine list, inventive cocktails and a charming atmosphere set the stage. The food quality and impeccable service rounded out a very enjoyable evening. We had the large seafood platter - it was generously portioned and beautifully presented. The beet salad was very nice, as well. For entrees, we had the halibut special, the roasted chicken and the bouillabaisse. All were delicious. We assume desserts would be great … but we couldn’t eat another bite. We noticed they have a great oyster happy hour and we can’t wait to return next time we’re in Des Moines."

Django,40,Good Place,I have been to this restaurant several times. I last went on a busy Friday night. I like soup and salad and ordered French Onion Soup and the Spinach Salad with shrimp. I had forgotten that that salad came with feta cheese. I am not a fan of these cheese and expressed surprise when the salad was set in front of me. The server immediately suggested that she could change out the cheese. She did this without blinking an eye. I really appreciated this gesture. The rolls (epi) are always delish as well. I will go back for sure and recommend this place.

Django,40,Great Food,This was our first time in Des Moines and we were looking forward to trying the downtown restaurant scene. We were not disappointed! We started with the Oysters Rockefeller which were creamy and flavorful. My husband had the New York Strip which he ordered medium well and low and behold it was cooked correctly! I had the scallops and they also were flavorful and grilled perfectly. The only slightly negative was our waiter was not very attentive. We had to get his attention to order a second glass of wine. We also ordered a Crème Brûlée to take backed to our hotel and asked our waiter for plastic silverware but when we got to our room there was none. They advertise French Cuisine without the attitude but we were not so sure this is true. Somewhat annoying. All and all we would recommend Django.

Django,40,"Attentive, Professional Service",The service was friendly and professional which seems to be unusual these days. Food was very good as expected. One of the best white tablecloth restaurants in DesMoines.

Django,50,Good Experience..,"Dinner tonight was fantastic. We had the same server as last time, Jordan. He’s so good at what he does. Three of the four adults ordered the filet Rossini because we’ve had it before and it was amazing. My dad got the lobster spaghetti and enjoyed it very much. We had escargot and onion rings which were also great. We were missing a snail in one of our shells, but it was no big deal as we had the onion rings and some bread to snack on. My daughter had chicken strips and French fries which she enjoyed, but I found the fries to be way over salted. I was also disappointed that they didn’t do anything to celebrate my parents anniversary even though I noted it in the reservation. Not as good as the last time we were here, but still good enough that we will be back again…. And again."

Django,50,Must try,"Had a wonderful dinner at Django. Management was fully engaged, service was very good and the food was incredible. Coq au vin was a favorite - very rich and full of flavor. Scallops with potatoes was delish and bouillabaisse was outstanding. Will be back."

Django,40,Good restaurant,"We had a nice meal at Django, pork was so tender and amazing.  Although both tables for two by the window were empty when we arrived (and they remained empty though out our almost 1h and 40 min visit) hostess said we could not seat there. Well, we were at the restaurant and clearly no reservations so I thought she lacked a bit flexibility and customer focus. But other than that, all was good."

Django,50,A favorite,"We love stopping in Django and snagging a seat at the bar. The menu doesn't change much, but it is very good. We have never left disappointed."

Django,10,Don’t DoorDash from these guys,"Staying at a local hotel here in Des Moines and after a long day traveling decided to take the front desk advice and order from DJanko for delivery. First estimate was 40 mins for delivery which seemed reasonable, then they called the hotel to say they were running 10 mins behind and after a further 20 mins they simply cancelled the order. No apology, no nothing. Left high and dry and hungry on a late Monday night thanks to their complete lack of customer service. Ended up eating at a local restaurant open late on Court Avenue. Glad we did not spend a dime with this restaurant and I would not recommend them. Period."

Epicerie,50,Good food,We really enjoyed the food. Small restaurant. We took the set menu and all 3 courses where really good. Desert was tasty. Food came quickly and was very fresh. We definitely go back again

Epicerie,30,"Small portions, not good value.","Location was fine. We sat to the rear of the restaurant which was nice. The food was well presented but very small portions. Small piece of salmon, one carrot, one spring onoion, one small piece broccoli. For the price NOT good value. The bread turned up at the end of our meal and was thrust on the table as an afterthought.  Wouldn’t sadly reccomend ."

Epicerie,50,Excellent surprise.,"Fantastic. Went in with no expectations and were happily surprised. Great service. Excellent food. Nice wine selections. Evry course, from entree to dessert was great. The cold melon soup was superb. The quasi of veal tender, tasty. House terrine was nice as was the pulled beef salad. Will probably be back tomorrow."

Epicerie,10,No vegetarian dishes,"overall the short experience was awful 😢,.we waited in a bar next door for an hour by which time we were starving. finally when we got in the restaurant we looked at the menu to find their menu had no vegetarian meals and on top of that the staff were rude and chucked a menu on us. we only came here because of the vegetarian status on tripadvisor"

Epicerie,50,"Delicious meal, moderately priced!","This is a quiet gem of a place in the center of a busy area. Staff were friendly and welcoming, despite my bad attempts to speak French. Menu is small but done right---options for meat lovers, fish lovers, vegetarians. Decent wine list and options. We felt relaxed and not rushed. The food was divine and one of the best meals we had in France. This is a family run establishment that cares about its guests."

Epicerie,40,Nice restaurant across from Chateau in Amboise,"We had a very good meal at L'Epicerie, which is on the main strip of restaurants right across from the Chateau. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, all of which was completely full on a Sunday night, so highly recommend making a reservation.    All of the food we had was very good. A couple things that stood out were the escargot and fricasse of langoustine and scallops. Service was very friendly and attentive. While we do speak some limited French, they have an English menu as well, which was helpful. Would definitely recommend."

Epicerie,50,Very tasty food! Great place to eat!,"This restaurant is very nice and we had great experience. Selected this place based on Rick Steve’s recommendation and we were very happy with delicious food( my husband said that his burger was out of this world good). The owner is very sweet and wonderful and her cheese recommendations were delightful. Service takes longer than what we are used to in US. From the start until we left was 2hours 15 min. Just like Rick Steve’s advised, slow down, enjoy the experience, stop rushing and you will have great evening. We have seen several couples get frustrated or simply leave because of slower service. If you can manage that its worth staying. Food was delicious. Definitely get the cheese course."

Epicerie,40,"Great good, service and ambiance","We just happened to choose this restaurant and we’re glad we did. The owner ( Aurora) was delightful and pleasantly explained everything to us in English. The food and wine was outstanding as well as the service. I’m speaking with her and complimenting the restaurant and food, she told us Rick Steves has featured her restaurant several times on his show. I see why and feel like we happened upon a gem."

Epicerie,20,I don’t advise,"May 22, 2023 me and my husband came to have dinner at this restaurant. made an order (menu). the first dish from the menu was brought only after 45 minutes, the next dishes we waited for 20 minutes. The quality and quantity of food does not match the prices. I do not advise"

Epicerie,50,Outstanding food and service in Amboise,"Spent 3 nights in the Loire Valley, near Amboise, with the intention of eating at different locations each night. But this restaurant was so good we booked a second night. The food is great and if you stick with one of the fixed price menus the prices are insanely good. The staff are friendly and helpful, especially the manager who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. The house wines are really good…both red and white, and a great value. Each of the 4 of us choose different menu items and we were all delighted with our choices….there were no bad or mediocre options. The venue is clean and inviting, and located in the heart of the main shopping/dining street. Would happily return!"

Epicerie,20,Disappointing,Disappointing - least favorable experience of 8 meals in Loire. Staff was not very inviting and food was average at best.

Epicerie,50,Excellent French dining,"We both had the scallop salad, including a shrimp, droplets of turnip, and more...very pretty and super tasty. Plat was the salmon, served with a rice composit, and a great sauce. For dessert I had chocolate mousse and my wife had creme brule. Both were good but the creme brule was better. The building was very romantic, and naturally very old. Dinner, 1/2 bottle of wine, large bottle of water came to 80 Euros. This is what we expected from a good French restaurant."

Epicerie,50,"Delicious food in a comfortable, homey setting","We waited to get to this restaurant because they are closed on Wednesday and do not take reservations online. We are so happy that we waited! This is one of the oldest restaurants in Amboise and is family owned. As with most French restaurants, the offer a formula menu, which is almost like an ""early bird special"" but without the stigma -lol.  Our selections included escargot, lobster raviolis, fricassee of langustino, a selection of cheeses, and dessert. Everyone works together , especially to accommodate non-French speakers. The food was delicious! One of the waitresses was very funny and particular about how she set up the table - had us laughing about the silverware placement because she is short and can't reach across to the far side of the table. Our only mistake was not getting a wine recommendation. This is a friendly, homey restaurant and well worth a visit."

Epicerie,50,Family run restaurant with a view of the Castle Amboise. Warmly welcomed. Delicious food & local wine recommendations,"We were warmly welcomed to a table without a reservation (we were early). Speaking broken French or very little French was no problem, Jean-Charles and Aurora could both speak excellent English. Not knowing much about the wines from the Loire area we were well advised with what would go well with our dinner choice. Food and wine was excellent as was the presentation there of. Desert was delicious and the choice of cheese again I deferred to Jean-Charles for advise which was again excellent. A really enjoyable evening under the shadow of the castle! Merci!"

Epicerie,10,Very rude waitress! Bad experience,"We came here on 1st May! I have never had bad experience in any restaurants whatsoever !    The waitress was terribly rude. I wanna to keep the butter from the table for the bread. She was so surprised and impolitely to answer me! I saw them so busy and slow. Didn’t want to ask for a butter and wait for another half an hour ! That’s why I asked can I keep the butter please? Politely! Surprisingly l received her bad attitude reply!  But it is not finished! At the end she asked everyone to give her the plates when cleaning up the tables in her order! She shouted No to my dad!? As that is not her way she want to clean up the table!  And she had to bring up the butter story again, she turned her head to me and asked me twice if I still want to keep the butter, because you wanted it!!! 🙄 Well all food are finished! She just want to be mean to me! I never seen such a rude waitress!    I seldom has to write such a bad and long review before! Sorry for the restaurant owner!!! This restaurant is very slow but I do understand because it is a small town, but being polite is a basic!!!"

Epicerie,50,Evening meal,"wonderful food and great ambience. L'Epicerie offers a warm welcome, friendly staff that offer great service and deliver good value tasty menus"

Epicerie,50,Great French restaurant in Amboise,Great menu and pricing. Staff was knowledgeable and service was great. Fixed price menu is the way to go.

Epicerie,50,Excellent Restaurant,We had a wonderfully delightful meal at L’Epicerie in Amboise. We arrived in Amboise late on a Sunday afternoon after an overnight flight from Los Angeles and a 3 hour drive to Amboise. We were tired. We decided to have dinner at L’Epicerie because we...More

Epicerie,50,Memorable Meal,"Enjoyed a marvelous meal at the suggestion of our hotel. Opted for the 36 euro meal that included a scallop terrine , a duo of Lott and large shrimp, cheese plate and a three sorbet dessert. Wonderful wine. Better than Paris!"

Epicerie,50,Very good dinner!,The meal was delicious. Tuna cooked to perfection! I did not expect this - because Tuna is usually hard to cook well. The service and food was great and I would recommend this restaurant.

Epicerie,50,Very nice,"Enjoyed a lovely dinner, nice atmosphere, varied choice in menu’s, good service. Especially tuna and duo of fish are recommended."

Epicerie,50,Monday Dinner,"Couldn’t have been better. The owner was checking on us and the food, service and wine was perfect. The price was reasonable and we had a delightful 1 1/2 hour dinner!"

Epicerie,10,Stay away from the steak!,"We ordered the steak with bernaise, cooked medium. The steak was not edible. So tough and over cooked! The staff was pleasant and relatively attentive."

Epicerie,50,A successful dinner,"It was an experience and a successful dinner. Impeccable service and delicious food. Try the onion soup and the kidney dish. A good wine, pleasant atmosphere."

Epicerie,30,Good food but poor service,"The only reason we gave a grade 3 was due to the long delay in the service. The food was perfect, the menu has many alternatives and the waitresses were nice. But they were full and very confused. If you are hungry, don’t go there."

Epicerie,40,"Pleasant atmosphere, good food","We enjoyed our dinner at L'Epicerie. Service was prompt and friendly, and selections were well prepared and presented. Price seemed reasonable."

Epicerie,50,Good value for money,"We were there two times, once for lunch and once for dinner. They serve very good food, with a twist. The staff is kind. They are a bit slow to serve dinner. I would definitely go there again 🙂"

Epicerie,50,Nice classic option,"Very nice building in old town, classic French food offer for a bistro, good relation quality/price and very friendly service"

Epicerie,50,"Great food, friendly service","My family of four was well fed and well taken care of on our last night in Amboise. We were happily surprised by the quality of the food at L’Epicerie since it’s located in a stretch of tourist restaurants. I enjoyed an in-season tomato salad starter and a delicious crispy pork chop main. My youngest loved the kids hamburger steak frites. The cheese plate for dessert was a highlight. The owner/manager carved portions from four cheeses of my choosing and was happy to give advice. All four were delicious. The staff happily spoke English and were very attentive, a rarity in France. Book ahead. Walk ins were turned away, especially on a Monday when most restaurants are closed. I wish we’d discovered L’Epicerie earlier in the trip, but we’ll certainly be back."

Epicerie,50,"Great location, decent food and friendly staff.","Everything was great, but most importantly the location. No complaints whatsoever, both food and the staff were great."

Epicerie,10,Stay away if you don't know French,"I have to say this was the most unwelcoming place we encountered during 2 weeks in France. The wait staff knows very little English we know only a little French. When it came to questioning some menu items, there was just no ability to get any information other that the name of the meat contained from the menu- no translation available. When I asked for someone who knew English, we waited a long time for someone who still could not describe a dish. As a result, we both ordered something we did not like, and I could not eat mine at all. When I asked the manager if I could get something else, the answer was NO. So honestly I can't say too much about the main dishes, but the salad and wine were OK. Luckily I had been eating well other places and just went without a dinner. I would not eat here again. Oh, and if you are wondering, I ordered pork and potatoes, thinking that it would be sliced pork, but it was a traditional French pork sausage that stuffed with all sorts of bigger and varied chunks and strings of things... ugh. Probably it is good to people who eat this."

Epicerie,50,Awesome dinner,"We both had the 4 course meal plus a bottle of phouilly fume .,from the flies gras to the escargots to the duck risotto and the mink fish what a meal. Very attentive service by the staff of ladies. The cheese selection was awesome including local cheese. The creme Brule topped off the night. Everything was excellent. The restaurant was full as they were turning people away. Fun atmosphere and a fun night. Highly recommended."

Epicerie,40,Not for gluten free,"My husband and I were pleased with the prices and the wine. The food was delicious, but if you have to eat gluten free beware! They do not have a clear understanding, but come across as if they do. There may have been croutons in my gazpacho, and there was definitely pasta on my plate of chicken. My husband traded meals with me, but if you have celiac, don't risk coming here."

Epicerie,20,What a disappointment,"I've been dining at L'Epicerie for over ten years now, and usually the standard is good. However, our experience last Saturday was poor. We chose from the à la carte menu: one of us took the lieu noir, another chicken, and a third ordered a steak à point. Whether they were understaffed, whether they had changed chefs is a mystery, but what is not mysterious is that we waited nearly an hour for a fish that was just about OK, a chicken that was moderately good, and a steak that was inedible. Of course we sent it back, and there was no problem about it being taken off the bill. But, and this is main point of this review, there was no apology, and no attempt at a commercial gesture, even such as offering a free cup of coffee. Of course a restaurant is at the mercy of its suppliers, but a chef really should be on the ball sufficiently to check the quality of his/her produce, and the staff should be trained to be more understanding if things go wrong. It will be some time, given the competition in Amboise, before I risk returning to L'Epicerie."

Epicerie,50,Lovely Little French Restaurant!,"We visited this charming little restaurant in September 2019, on the suggestion of our host at our bed & Breakfast! What w wonderful little place! She made reservations, and we're glad she did, as they were turning people away at the door! It is a true French restaurant, with wonderful meals and good service! This was a wonderfully experience for us!!"

Epicerie,50,Nice surprise,"Wandered in on a Monday- full house, but they still found a seat for us. Prices were modest and food and service excellent. Well beyond our expectations.    On a sidebar, a note to my fellow reviewers: saying a restaurant in France is understaffed implies a lack of understanding of the complexity of French labor laws. Of course they are. If they staffed the way most of the rest of the world does, they’d be out of business.    Regardless, this staff was great- enthusiastic, moving constantly, and unafraid. You can’t expect them all to speak English, but they should be willing to suffer through the customers’ brutal French- we loved the ‘we’re all in this together’ game-to-try attitude, which can often be missing in France.    Plus the owner went above and beyond - I won’t say how or others will expect the extraordinary level of service we received - but rest assured that attitude trickles down to the staff.    I have mostly stopped writing for TA, because, well, reviewers used to get paid! But in this case, I’m very happy to support a fellow small business. Can’t recommend this place more highly."

Epicerie,50,Excellent meal,"We loved our experience in this comfortable,warm and relaxing restaurant. Our meal was outstanding. The duck risotto was delicious and artfully presented. The beef with onion confit was scrumptious. Service was attentive and the owner was charming. Would highly recommend this eatery"

Epicerie,50,An impromptu visit,"The staff very kindly accommodated us with a table for two as we didn't have a reservation (so do book ahead). We chose from one of the set menus which was a 4 course meal for around €31pp with drinks on top of that, so very good value. And the food was excellent. A lovely dinner with very attentive staff and other guests who were good fun, too."

Epicerie,40,Decent place.,We had a good meal but there were a few misses. Burnt roast potatoes. I mean burnt. Wine list not very good. One the positive side... best cheese course I had in Amboise. Also the best buratta I have EVER had in the tomato salad. I would recommend.

Epicerie,40,Excellent food,"After a long day touring we decided to go out for dinner. Based on what was open on a Monday and TripAdvisor recommendations, we choose this restaurant and called for reservations. We were there a half hour later and all of us enjoyed the food. We could not get outside seating so it was a little warm inside. Good value for the money. Overall a great experience and compliments to the staff and chief"

Epicerie,30,Good people watching / cool castle views / okay food,"We booked a table here through our hotel and it was a busy little spot right on the main drag under the castle in an older charming building. The staff was attentive and helpful, the food was fine, (we both ordered off the two menus offered), and the people watching fantastic."

Epicerie,50,Excellent dining & warm service,We loved our dinner at L’Epicerie. The service was very friendly and while we don’t expect everyone to speak English it’s such a relief to be helped with navigating the menu.  The prix fix dinners are very good value and the wine selection by the glass is excellent and well priced. Almost forgot the desserts are fabulous as well!    Would definitely return and highly recommend to anyone looking to dine in the area.

Epicerie,50,Still excellent!,"After a gap of several years, it was good to discover that L'Epicerie has maintained its standard. We ordered from the à la carte menu and everyone in the party pronounced the food excellent. My own starter of foie gras followed by a risotto were very good, and it was a delight to watch the sunset, sitting beneath the great walls of the château."

Fleur de Sel,50,Quintessential Intimate French Dining,"If you are in the area, even for only a night or two DO NOT miss out on this delectable gem.    This is a romantic comfortable restaurant with only a handful of tables run by a brilliant woman and an impressive chef. Their cuisine is an ideal reflection of the terroir of the area. Order dessert, even if you feel like you might not be hungry for it at the beginning of the meal, you won't regret it.    We enjoyed the perfect egg, beef with potato, langoustines risotto, and we managed to procure a stellar bourbon vanilla creme brûlée even though we hadn't planned to get dessert. You may think you have had creme brûlée before, but you are lying to yourself, theirs is unforgettable.    Notes:  Bring a charged PHONE to read the QR menu.    Its up a hill, so try to plan your parking accordingly ahead of time. The streets can be quite narrow."

Fleur de Sel,50,"Outstanding, quaint restaurant! Don't miss this one!","Outstanding!!! This was our best meal of our week in the south of France! We dined at 2 ""1 Michelin star"" restaurants and this was more enjoyable. Alain Llorca and Chateau Eza had the views and high prices to go with it. Unfortunately only acceptable food. This is true French cooking. So delicious! Pumpkin soup, lobster salad that was perfectly seasoned...melt in your mouth beef and foie gras...We did the ""menu"" I believe it was 69 euros, and we did the three glass wine pairing which was perfect! I'm a wine professional so I am hard to please. The wines were very well chosen and perfectly paired with each course. I still sit and reminisce the taste of the beef and foie gras...and honesty I'm more of a fish eater than beef eater...I only got the menu because my husband wanted it...but it truly was incredible and I will never forget this meal. Michelin should give their stars to humble places such as this, instead of the places that they go to!"

Fleur de Sel,40,Delightful,"Delightful, cosy, restaurant, in a beautiful setting in the old hill top area of the town.  Front of house, Pascal Loose, is polite, calm, efficient, and knowledgeable, and puts you at ease with her humour.  Chef Phillipe creates very good dishes in the kitchen. Sweetbreads and pan-fried foie gras are exceptional.  Definitely recommended."

Fleur de Sel,50,Hidden Gem,"Small, intimate restaurant with excellent food. Tucked away and limited seating in a quintessential French village."

Fleur de Sel,50,Small but perfectly formed restaurant at the top of Cagnes Sur Mer,"We had an excellent supper in this small but atmospheric restaurant. Service was superb - friendly, helpful and efficient (and it should have been as we were the only people there that evening). The food was also superb. Really excellent cooking. I thoroughly recommend this small restaurant."

Fleur de Sel,50,Wonderful Dumb Luck...,"We stumbled onto a phenomenal Car service (Taxi Prestige) through a hotel I booked by flipping a coin back in January when the hotel wasn't even open... (Chateau Le Cagnard) The Hotel recommended Guillaume and Taxi prestige for airport transfer... and who we used for a complete day tour of Nice... besides being a great driver and tour guide, he recommended Fleur de Sel.  Guillaume called the restaurant from the car and booked us...  Lovely location, wonderful owner couple and great food... We had the lobster salad, the duck liver and beef entry, a nice cheese plate and a great desert on the prix fix menu... paired with wines, a bargain and wonderful way to relax and enjoy this small quaint town... check out the restaurant, the hotel and most of all Taxi Prestige to be your tour guide... money well spent. Enjoy."

Fleur de Sel,50,Treat yourself!,"We took the advice of a family friend and made a reservation at this incredible restaurant. The village itself is absolutely charming and storybook-like, almost like the set of a movie. Truly stunning.    Our meals were all so very delicious as were the recommended bottles of wine.    The environment was friendly, casual and filled with smiles.    We were happy to escape the craziness of Nice for the quiet of Cagnes-Sur-Mer for the evening to enjoy this lovely restaurant.    Reservations are advised to avoid disappointment."

Fleur de Sel,50,A Real Gem in Cagne-sur-Mer,"We saw this restaurant by chance and decided to wait for the 19:30 opening. What a good choice! Excellent food, good and jovial service, nice ambiance- all resulting in an excellent evening. The Michelin recommendation is well deserved"

Fleur de Sel,50,Dinner at Fleur de Sel,"Our family had a kind and genuine welcome by the owners. The charming and relaxing atmosphere set the stage for the incredible ""seasonal"" menu we were served. The wine pairings were perfect. We will definitely return. Thank you for a wonderful evening ! Bouge, USA"

Fleur de Sel,50,Marvelous Food & Experience,"One of the most delicious meals that’ll be remembered for a lifetime! The food is some of the best my husband and I have ever had anywhere in France (or anywhere), and the service provided was kind, attentive, and helpful. Such a sweet and cozy place to make it extra special. If you can, it’s absolutely worth every euro. And if you can’t get a table as a walk-in, ask about availability for the next night as that worked for us."

Fleur de Sel,50,Fabulous dinner,"We opted for the Carnival menu and it was fabulous. Nestled off the beaten track, this restaurant is a must to enjoy real quality French cuisine"

Fleur de Sel,50,FANTASTIC,The food was excellent and the treatment was fantastic. We loved everything from the venue. Surely a must do in La Côte D’Azur

Fleur de Sel,50,A culinary gem that feels like home,"We had an unforgettable evening at Fleur de Sel. Not only is the food amazing but the service is genuinely warm and kind. We had the ""Gourmet Menu"" and while every bite was delicious, some highlights include the beef, John Dory filet, pavlova, and perfectly paired wines. The hostess and chef care about every little detail to create a remarkable meal and lovely, cozy atmosphere. We look forward to coming back!"

Fleur de Sel,50,Outstanding!,We had an absolutely delicious evening at this intimate and charming husband & wife restaurant which has been serving unbelievable local cuisine for more than 20 years. We chose the 3 course ‘gourmet’ menu with wine pairings which was sensational and surprisingly good value. We’ll definitely be back! Merci!

Fleur de Sel,50,Incredible meal - don’t miss dining here!,"Had the most amazing meal on our trip to the South of France! It was a beautiful, private and quiet atmosphere and wonderful service. We had a few starters and main entrees which were presented beautifully and tasted even better. You must visit if you are in the area - you won’t be disappointed!"

Fleur de Sel,50,Excellent.,Outstanding gastronomic quality. Peaceful quaint environment. Excellent personal service. Best in the area. We will be back.

Fleur de Sel,50,Best Meal of My Life,"There is a reason that this restaurant has a M star. I have been in France for 12 days including Paris, Bordeaux, Avignon and I think I just had the best meal of my life last night. We had the seasonal menu with lobster salad, beef filet with foie gras (never thought I would like that - boy was I wrong), cheese, and a chocolate truffle dessert. Don’t overthink this - just make a reservation and go. In fact, we are going back again tonight I loved it that much."

Fleur de Sel,50,Fleur de sel,"This was the highlight of our vacation. A place full of charm, warmth and personality. The food is second to none, and the services just makes you wish to come back."

Fleur de Sel,50,J’aime,Tres bien!!! One of the best restaurants and fantastic foods in the French Riviera Highly recommend

Fleur de Sel,50,Everything was just perfect! Totally coming back.,"Me and my husband both took the seasonal menu, which we can really recommend. If you are looking for some traditional french cuisine and fresh local ingredients this is the place for you. Also the place was really cosy and the village were really cute. Make a reservation!!"

Fleur de Sel,50,Yum Yum Yum!,"For our last night in the village we decided to visit Fleur de Sel. Although tempted by everything, we opted for the prix fixe “Gourmet” menu which offered a selection of filet medallions and john dory as mains and we ordered both. Both were excellent in their preparation and presentation. The amuse bouche of gazpacho was delicious as was the crayfish and artichoke salad with the truffle oil vinaigrette. We finished with both a cheese course and a dessert. Nothing was short of excellent. The wine pairing was perfect. Service was attentive and very friendly. If we had another night we would return without hesitation. Highly Recommended. Reservations Required to avoid disappointment."

Fleur de Sel,50,Wonderful Meal,"The food here is outstanding. Family all had mains and dessert, the langoustine risotto was beautiful. The desserts were something else, amazing flavour packed into the citron and the raspberry desserts. Worth the walk up the hill to find the restaurant. Exceptional food."

Fleur de Sel,50,Delicious Provençal meal,"Delicious food, our best meal of the week. Kind service, local products, home made food and great wine recommendation."

Fleur de Sel,50,Best meal of the week,"Do not miss this wonderful place. We had the vacations best meal in this small, authentic place. The food was an elegant representation of the local cuisine and the wine matching was excellent. Price/performance is very favorable here! Not expensive at all!"

Fleur de Sel,50,Perfection,"Absolutely exquisite food and such warm, wonderful services. My husband and I stopped in hoping for a table and were greeted so kindly. We stared with the fresh apertivo and continue on to an incredible 3 courses via a la carte. Each course was better than the last. The setting is in the most perfect quaint little restaurant atop the hill. Absolutely perfect."

Fleur de Sel,50,5 stars++++,"So amazing!! Best dinner of our entire trip! If we could give this place more than 5 stars, we would. It’s the cutest little, unassuming place with the warmest welcoming staff. Highly suggest doing the seasonal menu—- we were not at all disappointed and licked our plates clean. Didn’t feel super touristy and was just an overall excellent experience."

Fleur de Sel,50,Fine dining Cagnes sur Mer,"Excellent, sophisticated menu with superb service. Strongly recommend. We were totally at ease and looked after."

Fleur de Sel,50,Delightful & Delicious Dinner,"Fabulous & delightful dinner. Exceptional service. I chose the seasonal menu with lobster salad, beef filet with foie gras & truffle sauce, fromage de brebis also with truffle sauce, and Valharona ice cream infused with Grand Marnier. Each dish was presented beautifully, and each was absolutely delicious. Delightful dinner, darling restaurant & friendly service. Highest accolades!!"

Fleur de Sel,50,French romance at its best,"This small intimate restaurant operated by the chef and his wife is the perfect place for a special dinner. Just a few tables, great service and the Southern French food is excellent. Nestled in the center of les Hauts de Cagnes a beautiful medieval village."

Fleur de Sel,50,Still one of the best restaurants,"We’ve eaten in the restaurant many years ago. Fortunately it’s still a fantastic as in the past. The friendly owners are still the same. The restaurant is located in the beautiful old town of Haut de Cagnes. It’s a small restaurant with only eight tables. So be sure to make a reservation in advance. The interior design is absolutely cozy. We’ve felt very comfortable. The food is very delicious. We hope that during our next stay in the region we can visit the restaurant again. It’s fantastic, that still exists such great places :-)"

Fleur de Sel,50,"No wonder it is Michelin 2020, 2021, 2022 & 2023!!","We stumbled across this gem during our two night stay in Cagnes Sur Mer. We were noticed by the Michelin Star signs on the front doors. This small restaurant is intimate, feels very French, and the dining experience was exquisite for a reasonable price. One of the least expensive Michelin Star experiences we have ever had - all over the world! We loved this place. The two salads with Lobster & Crayfish were amazing. I didn’t get a picture of the salads because we ate them so fast. Delicious! I wish we weren’t leaving France and I could go again."

Fleur de Sel,50,Charming experience,"I was staying in a lovely hotel in the medieval old town of Cagnes-sur-Mer. The hotel could not accommodate me and recommended this restaurant instead. I think in the end I lucked out. While it was a very quiet evening for a Saturday, my hostess/server was so gracious and so welcoming. She really made me feel at home. Traveling solo, I had my book to keep me company. The meal started with a delicious spring vegetable soup, it was served very hot and the flavors were so subtle. Asparagus, Spinach, Potatoes and certainly more. I then had the simpler of the beef dishes and it also was very refined without being pretentious.  On the whole, it was a delightful evening. Worth a small detour."

Fleur de Sel,50,Delicious meal in Cagnes-sur-Mer!,"What a lovely find in Cagnes-sur-Mer! Delicious food - from the Soup to the fish and beef dishes, to dessert! This was a wonderful dining experience and the patrons were very kind and extended such hospitality. Would highly recommend a meal here!"

Fleur de Sel,50,Spectacular meal in a medieval village.,"Sublime! From the moment you are welcomed into the charming Provençal dining room, you know you are in for a wonderful experience. The warm greeting from the lovely proprietor set the tone for a magical evening. The menu is exceptional, with traditional favorites with fantastic twists. I could not resist ordering the perfect egg to start. I had experienced it before at a temple to haute cuisine and it was runny and disappointing. But at Fleur de Sel, it was extraordinary. The egg was truly perfect, could just so that the egg did not run and served over pied de cochon with a perfectly dressed salad sprinkled with wild flowers. Amazing! I could not resist ordering the incredible decadent ris de veau and fois gras main course. It is a huge portion, served with a green apple purée and delicious pommes purée. It is so rich, but so worth it! I had a great half bottle of Blanc de Blanc which madame sent home with me. A spectacular citrus dessert ended the meal. As we were paying the check my husband and I were setting our plan to come back again before we leave. Do not miss this place!"

Fleur de Sel,50,"Lovely, charming, authentic experience.","Intimate restaurant with charming, personal service. Food was all freshly prepared with great care and skill."

Fleur de Sel,50,A wonderful evening - even better than we remembered.,We had a wonderful visit to this amazing restaurant having spent a lovely evening here last year. It didn’t disappoint and was even better than we remembered. There was a lovely relaxed atmosphere and the food is simply wonderful. We would strongly recommend spending an evening here.

Fleur de Sel,50,Highlight of our time in Cagnes Sur Mer,"My husband and I enjoyed a special dinner here and it was INCREDIBLE! The ambiance is unmatched, the food is some of the best I've ever had, and we loved the experience. We sat in this restaurant for three hours just enjoying our courses and drinks. I cannot recommend this little restaurant enough. It was one of the highlights of our entire trip."

Fleur de Sel,50,Delicious food and wonderful vibes,"This spot is perfect for a night with great ambiance, amazing food and incredibly friendly and helpful service. 10/10 would recommend!"

Fleur de Sel,50,Amazing dinner in Haut de Cagnes,"Such amazing food and a lovely, quaint atmosphere. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone traveling on the French Riviera!"

Fleur de Sel,40,Excellence,"For us, an unusual experience in ghe sense that the restaurant was run solely by a couple who clearly know dhat they are doing. This was first class foid and service and an albeit full yet fair price."

Fleur de Sel,50,A hidden gem…5+ stars,"Superb course after course! Delightful server, outstanding meal and fabulous wine…a winning combination. A charming atmosphere also. Would definitely recommend."

Fleur de Sel,50,Great service and great food and atmosphere,Lovely restaurant and very good food and atmosphere. The owner is very nice and friendly and the service was great. Highly recommend.

Fleur de Sel,50,April 2023,Exellent food and friendly services. We took the carneval menue and it was superb from the firar Course to the last. The winelist 👌

Fleur de Sel,50,A quaint intimate experience on the cote d'azur....,"We were recommended this fantastic restaurant by a local friend Guillaume and it was superb. Havin read some of the reviews the descriptions are perfect, a hidden gem, quiet and unassuming but what awaits is a lovely experience. The atmosphere is welcoming and intimate. The service was fantastic and accommodating to all, we had our two girls with us aged 9 and 13 and they were catered for as easily as us. The food was excellent, everyone raved about their meals and still talking about it! This is a definite repeat and if we are lucky maybe a frequent one to visit."

Fleur de Sel,50,Our favorite meal in France,"Wonderful spot for an intimate but unpretentious dinner - the food was beyond excellent, and certainly our favorite from our two week stay in France. A must-visit if you are staying near Haut-de-Cagnes, which is a beautiful place to spend time in and of itself."

Indochine,40,"A greatest, exotically and glam experience.","A greatest, exotically and glam experience, but only they some complicated with the dinner for single people, take care with this…"

Indochine,10,Horrible Food,"Food too expensive and nothing special . It’s not like Chinese food and really not worth it. If you make a reservation, make sure you are not seated outside. In general trust me really not worth it."

Indochine,10,The Worst Place Ever!!!!!,"The worst service, terrible food, no taste. The place is so so, don’t spend a dime on this terrible place!!!!!!!! Worst food I ever eat!!!!!"

Indochine,50,"Great , Super Restaurant","Great Food , excellent service, nice atmosphere, Don’t miss this restaurant. Rich Menu, tasty food. Service and staff welcomed us, drinks where good, nice beautiful people. NYC."

Indochine,50,Delicious food but loud restaurant,"If you can handle the noise in the space, this food is amazing. Really tasty dishes. Everything we got was perfect. Fried tofu, sea bass, and crispy red snapper. Nice servers... felt welcoming"

Indochine,30,Good atmosphere,"Nice place, good music, average fusion Asian food, we received a good service. Deserve a visit, normal prices"

Indochine,40,Good food expensive pretentious staff,Went with my siblings while in New York; very buzzy fashionable place food was really good especially the kale salad and pear wontons BUT our table was ready and Empty for 30 minutes before they chose to seat us; we asked for nibbles at the bar and we were glared at in disapproval: the staff do not crack a smile and are incredibley Unfriendly. Overall we had a great evening really enjoyed the food but I believe the waiting staff could do with a lesson in friendliness

Indochine,40,Fun atmosphere. Now seems more fusion than Vietnamese.,"The interior of Indochine is fun. Palm trees painted on the walls. Huge bouquets of real flowers. Cool vibe.    Unfortunately, the food is not as good as it has been in the past, when it was strictly Vietnamese. The beef salad and summer rolls are okay. The nuoc mam sauce is not vibrant. The flavors just didn't have the intensity that is usually found in Vietnamese food. The restaurant was packed on a Thursday night. The drinks are good and not unreasonably-priced. However, dinner for two can easily, and quickly, be well over $100.    The servers were in a rush, including when taking our order."

Indochine,40,Great food!,"I’ve been trying to visit Indochine for years and finally the stars aligned. The food was great, with the exception of the grilled salmon and the spring rolls. We had a large party of 8 and everyone left happy. The service was good in spots and the restaurant really bent over backwards to accommodate last minute changes we had to make."

Indochine,40,Not the best!!,"This place was good, period. The place is really loud, the service was just ok, and of course the food was really average, i would not recommend this place having so many better options in NyC, I would waste time on this place."

Indochine,40,A Neighborhood Gem,"Indochine has been at this location for 30 years but still retains a certain look and vibe that keeps it current. There is a pre-theatre menu (before 7 pm) that's a good deal, although not cheap. For $45, there is a choice (a somewhat limited number) of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. We tried the spring rolls for an appetizer, the grilled salmon and spicy chicken (our great server, Jill, was kind enough to switch the spicy chicken for the saigon chicken listed on the menu), and the lemon tart for dessert. The portions were ample, and very flavorful. We also ordered an appetizer of the baby back ribs, which are delicious - spiced perfectly, although a bit pricey ($20 for 6 ribs). Wine by the glass can be expensive (a bordeaux was $16), as is coffee ($4), but it is still a special (though loud) place to eat."

Indochine,30,Good food but noisy and crowded!,"This restaurant is good. Not excellent but good. It is soooo loud inside and the tables are so close together. We ordered the sea bass, rice with scallions, ravioli, and spring rolls, and shaken steak. It was enough for three but I wanted one more appetizer. The desert we ordered was lemon tart and crepe brûlée. They were okay but not exceptional. The decorations are strange, kind of 80s looking. The staff was good."

Indochine,50,"Very good food, great service but very loud",We came there Pre-show around 6 pm Thursday.. food and service is amazing but tables are Soo close together and it got Soo crowded by around 7.30 that it was impossible to carry the conversation.. I would recommend this place for food and service but not for romantic dinner

Indochine,50,Great Food and Service,Enjoyed a restaurant week experience at Indochine in NYC. Every dish that we saw come out looked awesome. Wish we had know it was next door to where Blue Man Group was playing!!!

Indochine,50,Unser schöner Abend in New York,"Very nice place. Prices are high, but the food is excellent. Service was a little bit slow. We habe seen more motivated service. Nevertheless we enjoyed the evening and would go there again :-) we had duck and spice beef. Both menus were excellent! Very Well prepared. We really enjoyed the food."

Indochine,30,"Delicious food, stuck up hosts",Food was delicious however the staff greeting at the door were very stuck up and not friendly. Even though we had a booking we waited thirty minutes for our table. Whilst waiting we sat at the bar to order a bottle of wine and we only just received the wine just as we were told our table was ready which is a long wait for some wine.    That being said the food was delicious and full of flavour and we did enjoy the meal but it got off to a rocky start! I’d recommend for the food.

Indochine,50,Unique experience,I have heard about this place from some friends and we wanted to try while visiting New York. I have to admit that it was one of the best Vietnamese food we have eaten. The restaurant decoration is what makes the effect also. You feel like you are in old times. The service was very good too

Indochine,50,Awesome downtown restaurant,"This is one of my most favorite spots in NYC! The food is outrageously delicious, the interior is wonderful and the people watching is also good:) Seriously tasty Vietnamese food in a super stylish setting. You will love this place"

Indochine,50,Excellent Asian with a French touch,"We went for a family dinner in celebration of a birthday. Reservations were smooth,greeting was friendly and courteous. food was excellent, actually better then some local restaurants that we visited during a recent trip to south--East Asia. During this Saturday eve dinner the place was very busy and hopping, this may explain the mixed service. we were very specific about the sequence and pacing of dishes--this did not work well--some plates were pilled together and others were delayed. waiters apologized with a smile.  Appetizers, salads and soups were excellent as were the fish entree`s. Deserts were a disappointment although a birthday cake was brought with a fanfare. This is not a ""cheapo"" but it is a worthwhile food and experience."

Indochine,40,Good food; a little bit expensive,"Within the announced ""New York Restaurant Weeks"" we had booked a table for early Friday evening at the Indochine. When we arrived at about 06.00 pm the restaurant was nearly empty. You enter the restaurant and you are in a big room with a beautiful bar. We ordered two three course menues including spring rolls, chicken / beef and desserts. The food was good, but nothing really special. On this level I expect something ""top"" on the plate."

Indochine,30,"nice food, weird","Trendy restaurant, very busy. Food is good, service is a little bit weird: started great but ended up too laid back, waiter went missing for a while. When another waiter cam, and asked if we could wait at the bar since we've finished eating. Interestingly, we were waiting to order the bill but no one would show up..."

Ivo & Lulu,50,Love pizza,Great pizza nice little place. They also have the best brownies and blond brownies in patzcuaro. They make bread to

Ivo & Lulu,40,Fabulous pizza,"Usually get pizza to go, great light crust, really great pizza. Great staff and of course Ivo is a host."

Ivo & Lulu,40,"Consistently above average pizza, bread etc.","Ivos is a consistantly good choice for bread and pizza. We have had several very acceptable pizza luncheons there. The crust is usually quite tasty. The sauce, toppings, and cheese are fine but not fantastic"

Ivo & Lulu,50,Ivo's,Excellent medium crust pizza with a variety of toppings. Business is also a bakery with baguettes and whole grain bread.

Ivo & Lulu,40,Great Pizza,"Ivo's has fast, cheap and delicious pizza and we carry one out several times a month. The brownies and blondies are also delicious. I highly recommend!"

Ivo & Lulu,50,Bakery Heaven,This bakery is a must to visit. We especially enjoy the sugar cookies and brownies. We visit this place almost daily. Once you've found it you will keep going back.

Ivo & Lulu,50,Pizza & Brownies!,"Swiss meets Mexico with this wonderful baker who has been baking in Patzcuaro for about 18 years. No ambiance, just good food"

Ivo & Lulu,50,Best Pizza Since New York,"I'm originally from New York, where the pizzas are world-class.    Ivo's is every bit a match for them.    The most important thing is that Ivo knows how to make real pizza dough, which automatically places his pizzas above anyone else's in the region.    And his toppings are incredibly generous.    His prices are a little higher than some of the competition's, but for quality there is no competition.    And his whole-grain bread and brownies are right up there with the best."

Ivo & Lulu,40,Good Pizza,If you want a very good Pizza this is the place. they also make excellent bread. Its located in downtown Pátzcuaro in one of the most beautifull squares you can imagine. Very good for the price.

Ivo & Lulu,40,Pizza and hamburgers,"In my two week trip to Patzcuaro, I went to Ivos twice. The first time I craved a hamburger -- which was so big, on a home made bun, that I could not finish it. The next time, four of us went for pizza, and we all ended up having hamburgers again! Nice place, and Ivo is a nice guy, not to mention, a great cook and baker. Try a brownie. Delicious."

Ivo & Lulu,50,Don't stop with the pizza!,"We were in Patzcuaro for almost 10 days so we did make the rounds of the restaurants. Ivos was a real treat. Both the pizzas and hamburgers were tasty (fries as well!). We loved the burgers but if you are plain food type of person, know that the hamburgers do have some spice to them, we really enjoyed it but if you are looking for a plain jane burger you might be disappointed. Once you finish with your meal, you must indulge in one of the brownies as well. We were told that Ivos originally opened offering only brownies - they are a wonderful treat.    Be aware that the restaurant is located in an interior courtyard and if the sign is missing from the sidewalk out front - it can be a bit tricky to find. Ivos shares the courtyard with a sushi restaurant, which might make it easier for you to figure out which hall to walk down."

Ivo & Lulu,50,"Great pizza, bread and hamburgers","The quality, flavor and service are the best in Pátzcuaro. The pizzas, the hamburgers are extraordinary and the bread is the best I've had in a long time. A must when you come to visit."

Ivo & Lulu,50,best pizza,probably one of the best pizzas ever!! The crust was made with herbs--just enough for flavor. The cheese was melted to perfection. My husband had the burger--what a burger--hand made--not a flat Costco type that you buy.and many restaurants serve. he owner is Swiss and more then accommodating. They had run out of coke--he went out and bought one. If in Patzcuara--be sure to stop in

Ivo & Lulu,50,One of the best pizzas in North America!,"Ivos is a little hole in the wall, with a combined dining area for a sushi bar and Mexican restaurant. The chef is a master baker -- amazing fresh rolls and bread daily -- but the pizza is one of the best I've eaten on this continent! It is super thin with a thicker crust around (pleases every palate) and oh so cheesy! Great burgers too. That's about it for the menu. I never tried the brownies (or brawneys as they advertise it) but people were taking them to go by the kilo. Definitely worthy of #1 restaurant in Patzcuaro! Note: only open 1:30-8pm."

Ivo & Lulu,50,"Pizza, bread, brownies....we love this place.","While spending 2 months in Patzcuaro last year we discovered this hole in the wall pizza spot. On our return trip to Patzcuaro this fall this was our first stop. We were delighted once again! the pizza crust is thin and crunchy, the sauce just right and the choice of toppings: meats, vegetables and cheeses are fresh and well chosen. The brownies are rich and moist and the loaf of bread we bought to take home was whole grain with flavorful, buttery crust.  Ivo is a great guy, too, always friendly and welcoming. Thanks for another great experience. HOpe to be back soon."

Ivo & Lulu,50,Best pizza in Patzcuaro,"Living here for 8 years, good pizza was impossible to find before Ivo moved to Patzcuaro. A wonderful baker by trade, Ivo uses that skill to produce a flavorful crust, that while not traditional pizza crust, adds to the overall quality of the pizza. This might sound odd, but he actually uses a tomato-based sauce on the pizza, something previously impossible to find here. He uses quality ingredients in ample quantity and the overall pizza is far and away the best in town. Eronga's loss is Patzcuaro's gain."

Ivo & Lulu,50,Ivor's Pizza is fantastic!,We just had Ivor Mottes' veggie pizza and it rivals any pizza we've had in the San Francisco Bay area. The crust was amazing and the veggies and goat cheese were fresh! We bought a loaf of his whole grain bread and it makes the best French Toast! We're going back for his hamburgers and brownies. This was one of the top eating experiences we've had while visiting Patzcuaro. Don't miss this eating experience and definitley tell your friends!  Marti & Scott

Ivo & Lulu,40,Outstanding!,"Been here many times. I honestly don't know which is better at Ivo's -- the Pizza or the Brownies. Both are great treats! The central table area is a little confusing at first, you're not sure which establishment has jurisdiction over what, but as far as I can tell, it's similar to a food court. But Ivo has a worker that waits tables as well, which makes it nice. IF you are prone to be cold, just remember to bring a jacket with you, as usually it's all doors open."

Ivo & Lulu,40,Terrific Breads in Addition to Yummy Pizza,"Ivo's is tucked inside an historic building at the corner of Ahumada and Plaza Grande. It's woth finding! Ivo bakes delicious breads which are often sold out early in the day. The baguettes are scrumptious, and whole grain bread is richly healthful and tasty. His pizza is probably the best in Patzcuaro."

Ivo & Lulu,50,"Pizza, brownies and bread","Ivo sells the best pizza in all of Mexico! He makes his own crust and the ingredients are fresh. (The one exception would be the processed ham, but the locals love it.) you can eat in or get take away.  He also sells freshly baked, whole grain bread and lovely baguettes. Both of these sell out quickly so you may need to reserve a loaf the day before. His ultimate product are his brownies. These have all the qualities that brownie-holics crave: choco hit, sugar hit, moist, available by the dozen, etc.  the great thing is that Ivo provides three of the major food groups."

Ivo & Lulu,50,Delicious,"Best pizza ever! I was never a big fan of eating the crust, NEVER, but Ivo's pizza is just so delicious it is hard to resist eating the entire thing. He also bakes the worlds best brownies. Every time I go it is a must, first the brownie and then the tasty pizza."

Ivo & Lulu,50,More than just pizza.,"One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Ivo, the owner, is personable and his baked goods/breads are just great. Make sure you have a brownie or a dozen. Love this place."

Ivo & Lulu,40,"Best hamburgers anywhere, but where are they?","I have loved Ivo´s bread for years and used to serve it in my own restaurant. Recently he began serving hamburgers that are the best I have had anywhere in Pátz or, hell, anywhere at all, but he has stopped making them, and I WANT 'EM BACK. They are hamburgers that taste great and come on his fabulous baguettes and stacked with fresh and delicious salad. What a concept! I grouse at him all the time about them, and I think they may come back, but please, Ivo, not just on the weekends. I want them 24 hours a day!"

Ivo & Lulu,50,Best Pizza in Patzcuaro,Ivo's pizza is great.. made from fabulous ingredients and fantastic. Also fabulous bread. His baguettes are AWESOME.

Jacques Brasserie,50,Our Favorite Anniversary Spot,"This restaurant has outstanding French cuisine and the best service anywhere. They have excellent seafood and duck, and they often serve tomatoes or other items grown in their garden. Definitely order a souffle for dessert. They are unique and well worth it. The lovely country French decor in its beautiful garden setting makes the experience even better."

Jacques Brasserie,30,Not great.,"Have been twice in Aug., once in Sept., all for lunch on the weekend. I really enjoy bouillabaisse and ordered it each time. First 2 were good, but the last time the lobster (I think that's what it was) was inedible. Will be back again at the end of Oct. but am afraid to order my favorite. Maybe I can find a new favorite. I think things have slipped a little."

Jacques Brasserie,50,Pure joy!,"We celebrated a family member’s 78th birthday here and it couldn’t have been more enchanting! We all had different dishes which were all excellent. The service was incomparable; we were never rushed or ignored. As an aside, we were here last year for yet another family birthday as well as the year before. We all love this place for its outstanding meals and its beautiful surroundings. We don’t think it can get any better! Merci Beaucoup!"

Jacques Brasserie,50,Christmas Eve at L'Auberge,"Our family has visited this restaurant over almost four decades. We especially enjoy Christmas Eve which is festive as well as delicious. Yes, we have celebrated birthdays here and even lunch with special friends. But Christmas Eve brings many fond memories of many years of delicious French cuisine with outstanding service."

Jacques Brasserie,50,Everything was superb,"Everything was superb. We did the fixed price menu. We had three glasses of chardonnay. (Surprised no prosecco by the glass on the menu.) My wife had the mussels, and I had the beef cheek cassoulet. We both had the ""from their garden"" tomato salad. We both had the veal scaloppini. We got the desserts to go--cheesecake and chocolate tart. They served nice breads, started us with a tomato juice amuse bouche, a lemon sorbet palate cleanser came later, and some chocolate bon bons at the end. Service was perfect, attentive yet unobtrusive. A meal well worthy of their reputation."

Jacques Brasserie,50,A great value for an upscale dining experience.,"We wanted to find a nice anniversary location, but our best time (and cost!) was lunch at LAuberge. We are glad to make the choice! This is a charming 'French country inn' run by a family for over 50 years. IWonderful service and high quality choices made for a great meal selection. I wanted to try their new veggie bourgeoisie, it was unique, health and tasty. My wife loves trout, she make a great choice. Better choice than much of the overly expensive Washington DC area."

Jacques Brasserie,50,Outstanding food and service for over 31 years,"After 31 years, L' Auberge Chez Francois continues to be my favorite restaurant in the world. If you have a special occasion to celebrate or THE romantic dinner or just an amazing multi-course dinner experience with excellent, well trained service, L' Auberge Chez Francois is in a class by itself.    Service is always excellent, but a special shout out to Soufiane, our waiter, who was a 10 star waiter. He offered us more cottage cheese and garlic bread when he saw it was mostly gone by the time we received our drinks with a smile and saying how much we enjoyed it. He kept an eye on us to make sure we wanted for nothing and had a fun personality naming all the sorbets and amuse bouchée soups to see if there were any we had not had in 31 years of coming (we still need to try the tomato leek amuse bouche). Dinner was phenomenal as always.    For outside dining, they have a huge tent with fans in the ceiling corners. Plenty of fresh air. Plastic walls can be pulled in case of rain. The tables outside and inside are spaced apart to allow for privacy and safety when dining.    You can walk to see their gardens. They grow many tomato plants for their tomato salad and gazpacho, squash, cucumber 🥒, beans, and herbs. The gazpacho and tomato salad feature fresh tomatoes from the garden!    We love the cottage cheese spread and garlic bread with the House Aperitif, champagne, Chambord and a raspberry. The unique flavors wake up my taste buds to say, ""We have arrived at L'Auberge. Prepare to have fun!"" My husband also enjoys the beer with the orange liquor.    Dinner is Prix-fixe or you order your appetizer, salad, entree, dessert and everything is included.    We love the garlic bread and cottage cheese spread. The other bread and butter is delicious as well.    A soup course - it was tomato bisque.    Appetizers over various dinners that we have enjoyed:  - New appetizer not on the menu: Tuna Tartar martini - if you love tuna tartar, this will make you so happy! Fresh, a heaping of tiny cubes perfectly seasoned. Just perfect for the summer.  - Waygu beef cheeks in sherry base, looked like a stew. The beef were so soft and tender that truly melted in your mouth.  - Onion soup - my husband used to not like onion soup until he had it here. It is delicious and the recipe is available online.  - Roquefort cheese tarts with caramelized applies, cinnamon and Calvados is one my favorite appetizers. It can be a bit filling.  - Warm asparagus on Virginia country ham, cheese medley, quail egg  - Trio de Saumons - Norwegian salmon, house-dilled cured, rillettes, smokes, salmon caviar, capers    La Salade de l'Auberge or Mixed green salad or garden fresh tomato salad.    Fruit sorbet to cleanse the palette course. Sorbet - passion fruit last visit - 31 years and we never had this one - slightly fruity, slightly sweet and a gentle tart taste. Love it!    I normally get the Le Homard du Maine or Maine lobster with jumbo lump crabmeat, citrus, Sauternes sauce. My husband gets the steak (such as the Beef Tornados) or wild Maine halibut. We also enjoy the Chateaubriand de l'Auberge (for two) which is the roasted beef tenderloin, baby vegetables, Bernaise, truffle sauce.    Our favorite dessert is the scoop of vanilla ice cream with the dark chocolate tart. I normally ask for the tart To Go, and the ice cream for the restaurant. It keeps the wonderful L' Auberge experience lasting one more night for a wonderful dessert. I also love the three sorbets or ice cream in a Tulip shell crisp cookie. The soufflés are also lovely - chocolate, Grand Marnier - you will need to order these when you order your dinner    Chocolate truffles before the bill    My tips are:  - make reservations  - eat very lightly that day or skip lunch  - If you wear high heels and do not want to walk on gravel, have your driver drop you off at the front door since the parking lot is gravel  - there is one handicap accessible bathroom on the main level near the wine otherwise the are several bathrooms down the stairs next to the bar and down past the Brasserie."

Jacques Brasserie,50,"Wonderful service, Delicious Feast!","We hadn't been to L'Auberge in about 15 years, but the food was as good as I remembered it. Our server was very friendly, and everything was served efficiently. Come with a BIG appetite if you plan to go with the fixed price menu! From the bread, to the appetizer, to the salad, to the generously-portioned main course, to the dessert, it's quite a feat to finish this meal. (We didn't! Had to take most of dessert home.) This is a wonderful place to visit for a special occasion."

Jacques Brasserie,20,Disappointed,"The Auberge is tired and old. The building that seemed like a quaint inn, 30 years ago just seems rundown now. The staff is friendly, the wine selection is good and the service is on point. The food, however, is now mass produced to accommodate what could be as many as 200 diners on a busy Friday evening. Based on the rest of the building the kitchen is undoubtedly the same as it ever was and to keep churning out meals they serve, for example, sheet pan fingering potatoes - three to every plate. The main courses are devoid of taste and feel like they came off a cafeteria line. For decor there was an extension cord randomly stapled to the middle of a wall connected to nothing. They now have tables outside under tents and crammed on patios in addition to the inn. It just feels like they are trying to maximize the income they can garner before people catch on that the gig has been up for years. This is no longer a special place to eat."

Jacques Brasserie,30,French country without the French,"Mediocre food, tired decor.  The setting is lovely, but the place is coasting on its reputation among old timers. Chez Francois is not worth the visit for the food, especially given the choices the DC area has to offer. It purports to be French, with prices to match, but the menu is uninspiring and generic and the food just average."

Jacques Brasserie,30,Not up to it’s former self.,"Over time L’Auberge has dropped items from its menu, such as sweetbreads, the Alsatian plum tarte and Alsatian mixed grill. Biggest disappointment this outing was the Grand Marnier soufflé, which had great consistency but left me wondering if they’d forgotten the Grand Marnier. Okay I should have given it four stars, perhaps, but it just didn’t measure up to its former self."

Jacques Brasserie,30,DECENT-ORDERED RARE CHATEAU BRIAND BUT GOT MEDIUM RARE,"FIRST, MY daughter purchased our anniversary dinner using their online menu-it showed $208 but it was $360. That's a big difference and false advertising for such a restaurant. The service was good, atmosphere good but ordered our roast rare and it came medium rare but more on the medium... However, it was good but not what we wanted. Told the waiter and thought we get at least a discount but NONE. 2/14/2023"

Jacques Brasserie,50,Consistently great,"My wife and I, plus sons. In-laws, and other relatives, have been eating here for more than 40 years. Food, service and ambiance are outstanding. Don't forget to have the house ""special"" appertive"" and, if you want a souffle, order it at the start. Enjoy!"

Jacques Brasserie,50,Nice lunch - nice ambiance- nice service,"We had as always great time tasting this fine and delightful food. We both had the menu. I had the mussels which came on a sauce similar to escargots— very nice- . I had the house salD, simple, fresh and very refreshing, then i enjoyed the trout… uhmmm yummy.. and the creme brule. My friend opted for the lobster salad which was very good, but I need a warm plate instead of a cold one. The warm roquefort was delicious. In fact all was very delicious."

Jacques Brasserie,20,Disappointed dining experience,"I was disappointed with my dinner experience tonight. I made a reservation over a week ago and specifically said that two of the four of us are vegetarian and asked about options. The response from who I spoke with was that ""we will create something for you- no problem"". I also saw a review online that said that a man brought his wife there for her birthday and they did not disappoint and created something vegetarian for her.    My disappointment came from the fact that the waiter had no idea that I had requested this specifically and had spoken with two people who confirmed they would make something good for us. Our waiter said ""yes, we can give you a plate of vegetables"". Basically, we'll saute whatever is available and will put it on a plate for you. So one of us ended up eating salmon and the other got the vegetables. Yes, they were sauteed but really? That's all we get for $25? So many restaurants have amazing vegetarian options. And honestly, if you had said, sorry, we don't have much then our expectations would have been set. But based on my conversation with your staff and the online review, I expected something better. Our waiter was no help and had no idea what I was talking about.    I've been to this restaurant many times over the years and over the past several years, I've changed to a vegetarian diet. No one has to accommodate this but then they need to tell people so we know what to expect. I hardly ever send emails like this but I'm disappointed. We brought friends and I fully expected to be ""wowed"" by a delicious meal but was not.    If you can't accommodate vegetarians, please educate your staff and phone staff so they can advise patrons appropriately."

Jacques Brasserie,40,Old school French restaurant for a special occasion,"My wife and I went for a Sunday midday dinner with my sister and brother in law. My sister tells me that our family went to this restaurant over 50 years ago when it was in DC. It moved to its present location in the 70s. The drive from DC is quite scenic if you stay off the Beltway. The feel of this French restaurant is very nostalgic. We ate in the main restaurant which has quite a capacity, even without counting the outside seating. The dining areas are broken up into rooms so that it doesn’t feel quite so large. The menu is very traditional. The menu is prix fixe. There is a brasserie that is a la carte. The prices vary for each entree, but the entrees include appetizer, salad, and dessert. Some appetizers, salads, and desserts cost additional. Neither my wife nor I tend to eat so many courses, and we often share, so I would prefer a la carte pricing. I had a red ale on tap from Quebec. It was quite good. My sister had a cocktail that was good, not great. They have French wine by the glass. The food was very good. I had oysters, which were regional and excellent. They cost $10 extra. The menu said there were six to a serving, but I received seven. My sister had a mushroom crepe that was delicious. My wife’s gazpacho was very good. The special tomato salad was fresh and clearly from a garden, not a supermarket. My brother in law had veal scallopini that he said was very good. My wife enjoyed her cold lobster salad. My sister enjoyed her bouillabaisse. The server alerted her that it had saffron, in case she did not like saffron. The server was quite helpful with suggestions and explanations. I had the trout almondine which was prepared much like a sole meunière and was quite good and not too heavy. The special dessert is a soufflé, available in three flavors. Everyone but me ordered one. The soufflés were presented with a ritual of piercing the top and pouring the filling into it. You have to put in your order with dinner. Interestingly, they did not show us the dessert menu until after dinner. I waited, preferring to see the menu items. I am glad I waited. I had the special desert, a plum tart which was made with poached fresh plums. Overall, we each enjoyed our meals. I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion. It is best enjoyed slowly, with plenty of opportunity for good conversation."

Jacques Brasserie,50,Outstanding Meal and Service,This was our first time dining here (for a retirement party luncheon) and everything about the meal was fantastic. Service was second to none.

Jean Georges,50,Birthday surprise,"My wife booked this restaurant for my birthday. We had the ten course tasting menu. The food did not disappoint, absolutely delicious. The service was great too. Will be going back."

Jean Georges,50,Special experience,Special occasion experience Expensive but worth every penny Service including reservation process outstanding Greeted by name We had testing menu which came w extras So value for the $$$$

Jean Georges,50,"Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm 64?","The answer is ""yes"" and my husband proved it with a night out at Jean Georges. The dining room is light and lovely. The staff, especially our wonderful server, Carolyn, were perfectly attentive. She described each course with relish and a gentle enthusiasm that heightened our anticipation. The 6 and 10 course omnivore tasting menus did not disappoint. The corn fritter with black truffle and silken tofu with apricot amuse bouche were exquisite bursts of perfection in a solitary bite. My favorites were the yellowfin tuna noodles and the egg toast with 3 perfectly coddled yolks lined end to end and topped with caviar. My husband shared tastes from his 10 course menu and the heirloom tomatoes and badger flame beets were such fresh reminders of the best of summer gardens - all with delicately enhancing infusions, spices and herbs. I also loved the squash roasted with parmesan. The sommelier gave a great recommendation for an Austrian wine (Ott) that complemented every course. And the ending was oh so sweet - a roasted peach and a special chocolate mousse birthday treat. The meal was a ""valentine, birthday greetings, and a bottle of wine"" all rolled into one."

Jean Georges,50,Subline,"This restaurant seems never to waver below excellent. We had both the vegetarian and regular pre fixe. None of the dishes were a failure. Some were better than others, but all, more or less were nothing short of excellent. The wine list was extensive with some moderately priced bottles. The only negative is that the restaurant is in the Trump International. If you can move beyond that fact, you will have an exceptional experience."

Jean Georges,30,Disappointed,"The menu was priced fixe at $ 150 pp vegetarian meal or a 6 course diner at $ 300 pp  We didn’t want to spend $ 300 pp  So we chose the vegetarian menu.  It was very disappointing, and I ended up with stomach cramps. I also cannot eat fried food so they replaced the fried food with a frizze salad which I hate. No other choices.  We love the restaurant and have been there many times.  Unless they change the menu future visits may not happen and in all sincerity at $ 300 pp for food plus wine and a cocktail plus cappuccino, tax and tip your bill is over $ 500 pp that is ridiculous for getting together with some friends .  And the vegetarian food wasn’t even good, it seemed very exotic but really!  Sorry , I don’t like to leave a bad review but I really loved the old menu and the choices.  The service was lovely , most professional and the atmosphere was great.  They did a good Covit procedure but they were unexpressed by the fact that we were fully vaccinated."

Jean Georges,50,Fantastic meal in our own little glass house!,"My family made a reservation to dine in one of the individual glass pods in mid December. It was a beautiful setting complete with a HEPA filter, a heater, and a sound system that we could control. The service was fantastic. Our group did the tasting menu and it was absolutely wonderful. I can't say enough about this experience. I look forward to going back to Jean-Georges after Covid is in the past!!!"

Jean Georges,50,Exceptional as always,"My wife and I had not been to Jean Georges in about two years. Due to the pandemic and we were reluctant to go, but they were very well prepared and took the matter very seriously.  We had the six course tasting menu which was superb, each dish was a standout.  The egg caviar toast was phenomenal. The foie gras was exceptional. My wife is not a big meat eater and the gentleman who took our order gladly replaced the rack of lamb for a lobster dish which she loved, I had the Lamb and was thoroughly impressed.  The service was top notch as always, the young man who was taking care of us was a delight.  I can safely say Jean Georges is clearly among the top restaurants in NYC.  We will not be waiting 2 years before we return!!"

Jean Georges,50,Top class,"Exactly as we expected! The restaurant is beautifully decorated. The service was impeccable and the food was even better. We enjoyed several courses but the pasta was by far our favorite dish - balanced, rich flavors, and a lot of texture. Besides food, the thing that we liked the most, and weren't expecting, is the easygoing and very relaxed atmosphere. The location is pretty much perfect - overlooking Central Park, and actually really convenient - if you want to go for a walk and burn some calories after delicious and filling lunch:)"

Jean Georges,50,Excellent Christmas Day Meal,"I dined here with my family on Christmas Day. I've dined here many times before, but this was the first time I had dined here on a major holiday and my family and I left impressed and satisfied after an amazing meal. We were seated at a table by the window with a gorgeous view of the park. We chose the Christmas Day tasting menu and it was superb. Dining at Jean-Georges is always an experience, never simply a meal, but this tasting menu went even further in its level of excellence. Each dish was better than the next. Of course, in addition to the perfect combinations of flavors, the plating of each dish was artful and the wine pairings were exceptional. The hospitality was top-notch and the staff were knowledgeable. I always recommend Jean-Georges for an exceptional meal that you'd expect from a restaurant with two Michelin stars, but now I'll also recommend them for special occasions. "

Jean Georges,20,"Once good, now bad!","It was a beautiful day in NYC and I received an email informing me of a special dish this weekend! I called two friends and we ran down for lunch on Saturday. Jean George is situated at Columbus Circle and since dining outside is the way we have to live these days it was perfect. We sat at the bar and downloaded the menu but didn’t see the special. When we inquired we were told they didn’t have it. I quickly showed our server the email and photo of the special and where it said “This Weekend” and she said “ohh, we sold out if that in the first hour.” I said how could you advertise to thousands of former customers about a special and have only enough for an hour? The answer was ridiculous, they blamed it on the purveyor. The manager told me they received enough for only 12 dishes! I’m sorry but anyone who knows about restaurants knows they get confirmations before they make a marketing plan. We traveled for an hour to get there and parked 5 blocks away. Needless to say, a great disappointment with little apologies or concessions.    We ordered from the regular menu and although the presentation was beautiful the Hamburger was ordinary with no exceptional taste, the tuna tartare was bland and boring and the salmon sushi was real nova salmon over some sesame rice. Oh and a small ice tea in a plastic cup was 6$!! 115$ for this meal. I never mind spending money for quality but if Jean Georges Head chef was really creating these dishes I would be shocked. I’ve had better diner food! My cousin owns a famous restaurant just across the street in The shops at Columbus Circle and while they are forced to be closed even closed is better then fees people sub-standard food at a 5 star restaurant!    My advice is stay away and don’t go to Jean Georges while we are in this pandemic. I cook and I can do far better then this"

Jean Georges,50,Magnificent!,"Continues to be a truly outstanding dining experience! We have come here to celebrate special occasions and Jean Georges never ever disappoints. In fact, we have yet to find any other place that offers comparable food, service, and atmosphere.    Due to COVID19, only terrace seating was available and it was lovely!!  Today was a landmark birthday for my husband. The terrace space allowed children and the staff members were so welcoming, attentive, and professional.    A special shout out to Kanal who answered my many questions about dining/weather/etc the days preceding and was completely reassuring.  .  We tried the tasting menu that included: egg toast/caviar/herbs, tuna tartare, steamed black bass, pepper crusted wagyu tenderloin, peach pie, warm chocolate cake, and our son had the cheeseburger w fries.    Every single dish was still as magnificent visually and gastronomically as when we would dine indoors    The main changes from the usual were the dinnerware/utensils/menu (now online) understandably due to precautions. No amuse bouche's or after dessert sides, but we normally cannot finish all that anyway.    We cannot send enough compliments about the Jean Georges restaurant experience. It continues to be a feast for the palate, eyes, and soul.    Thank you for reopening and being such a treasured oasis in the heart of Manhattan!"

Jean Georges,50,Fabulous meal for our honeymoon,"I came for lunch with my husband in the dining room. The setting was beautiful, and the service faultless.    The 'four' menu was perfect and very good value - although this is a 5 star review I would advise diners to check with the servers which items come with a supplement - it wasn't very clear that both caviar dishes came with a supplement, so the bill was a bit of a suprise when it came! Nonetheless we both laughed about this after, did the rest of our trip on a tight budget, and agreed that it had been the tastiest dish of the whole meal - we're strangely glad we made the mistake.    I'd definitely go again, and will check out the London restaurant back home.    Thank you!"

Jean Georges,50,Wonderful Michelin 2-Star restaurant in NYC!!,"This is a very sophisticated, remantic French in NYC, on the first floor of Trump building overlook the Central park. We had a wonderful meal there, and the their wine collection is amazing!"

Jean Georges,50,Our Fifth Visit and It Gets Better Every Time.,We met an old friend here for lunch and it was our first lunch ever here after a number of dinners. The room is beautiful and done in white and it is elegant. We chose the four course tasting menu and the food was superb. The ladies had the wine pairings and they raved about the wines. I had to stop eating bread since it would have been easy to fill up on the bread it was so good. The best course seemed to be the scallops among four great courses. The desserts were unbelievable and the ladies chose chocolate; the presentation of which was pure art. I do not have a clue about my dessert which was a white ball chilled with tropical fruits but it was super good. Service was over the top by a team of talented servers. A perfect meal.

Jean Georges,50,Once again SUPERB,"Have been coming here since my 50th birthday, now nearing 60. Hear this weekend for 20th Anniversary with friends and yet again Jean George delivered. Ambience superb. Staff and service exquisite. Food divine.    We booked a luncheon with friends. Their first time and they loved it. We did the four course fixe prix and the wine pairing. Wine pairing was EXCELLENT. All v nicely finish with small sweets and their signature marshmallows    Staff very knowledgeable. Very professional. Also engaging    Once again a v memorable experience at JG    Though in a Trump named building, JG have no association They are independent and only rent space from the gilding that is owned by GE    The location is superb and the rooms lovely"

Jean Georges,50,Deserving of a third star from Michelin.,My experience here was better than at other three or two star restaurants in the City that I have visited. Service was impecable yet friendly. Every dish was a work of art. I look forward to returning soon.

Jean Georges,50,Fabulous elegant lunch,"I had a fabulous elegant lunch here on Saturday, Jan. 18. Georgia and her team did a great job with flawless service and making feel comfortable despite dining alone. I was given a great table by the window overlooking a snow-swept Central Park. I had the omnivore four-course lunch which is a great value, plus a tasty G&T and a glass of Pinot. The amuse bouche was delicious, as was the tuna ribbons, baked oysters, tenderloin, and dessert (see picture). I can’t wait to return."

Jean Georges,50,Fantastic Fine Dining Lunch,Have been here a couple of times and the service and food here are impeccable. The gluten free bread was great and all the courses were equally as delicious. Wait staff are attentive and relaxed/friendly without being too over the top. Would highly recommend.

Jean Georges,50,Best dinner and atmosphere,"I will start this review by saying you get what you pay for. If you are going here for an experience you have come to the right place. Service was a 10, wine and wine selection was a 10, food was a 9.7- i can’t give everything a perfect score. The location is great, which is right across from Central Park. Great place for a special event, such as birthday or anniversary dinner and very very impressive. The bill is going to be what it is in this part of town and you will not be disappointed after you leave and pay the bill. Staff was excellent and looking forward to going back with my wife again. I have been a few times for work and personal and both are perfect. Afterwards you can go to Central Park, Time Warner center, movies, there is plenty to do. Also some of the best hotels in NYC are all with 5 blocks or so."

Jean Georges,50,Tasting menu 6 courses,"Excellent in every respect. Service was impeccable. As was food. Seated 745 and left 10:30. Well paced.,Quiet enough for four of us to talk."

Jean Georges,10,Corked aperitif USD 160 for,Corked aperitif USD 160 for two small pieces of caviared toast Spoke with Svetlana the manager who is trying to fix this awkwardness Hate to do this in good company

Jean Georges,20,Average food quality and less,"Average food quality and less than poor service. We stayed at the attached Trump Hotel and went to breakfast at 10:45 on Saturday. No problem. Went at the same time Sunday and were told they don’t serve breakfast after 10:30??? No explanation, and zero attempt to accommodate us. The wait staff we encountered were slow and unfriendly. I would not return."

Jean Georges,50,NYC's finest,"I just love this place. I've been here several times.  It is expensive but it's a experience. You will not be hungry after this tasting menu.  World class service and amazing food. Presentation is beautiful, even palate cleansers are good ! lol  Overlooking the globe and Columbus circle you can feel how alive NYC really is.  If you have a big celebration, want to impress someone or be treated like a king this is it. Chef is mostly there and he'll come out to dinning room as well. I can't even select few dishes casue there was nothing I didn't enjoy. Save room for homemade gummie bears and hand crafted mout watering marshmallows."

Jean Georges,50,One of the most amazing meals ever!!,"Was in NYC for a conference and decided to see if we could do lunch here. I had read so much about this restaurant and the type of menu /cooking style ( French-asian influenced) that was intriguing.  We did the Four Course Omnivore wine pairing lunch in the dining room.    First off, the service was impeccable, the surroundings beautiful and the place settings and room perfect. Every single item was amazing and the wine pairing divine.    My friend and I are both avid foodies, good cooks ourselves, and thus very particular.  We started with a caviar creation that had caviar on toasted egg yolk on a crostini that was superb. Prior they served a mushroom broth tea that had such an amazing nuanced layers of flavors we were both mesmerized and consumed with trying to figure out the ""how"" and ""what"" component.  Our next course was YellowFin tuna ribbons with avocado, radish in a ginger marinade. He had the Foie Gras Terrine on a brioche sponge with cranberry and white chocolate.  I don't know how they pick and pair the flavors, but we were blown away. Every bite was a delight. We could not stop talking about how they may have constructed this in order to try and replicate the layers of flavors we were experiencing.  At this point, he decided to buy a cookbook lol -and, lo and behold Jean Georges himself happened to enter the dining room! We were lucky to quickly chat with him and he signed the cookbook for us!  The next course was Gulf shrimp with a lemon-fennel emulsion and my dish wish peekytoe crab risotto with puffed rice and nori. Also a taste extravaganza.  Finally we ended with roasted beef tenderloin poached daikon and mustard essence - a completely perfect pairing. The sommelier was so engaging,helpful and lovely as well. She answered all our questions patiently and wrote down the Muller-Catoir Rieslaner that I particularly liked for me.  The desserts were delicious, well presented and unique as well. Honey roasted peanut ice cream with caramel.  My friend said is was probably the best meal he had in his life.  for me it was in the top three meals in my life.  I have been fortunate to have eaten at several Michelin 2-5 star restaurants and this resoundingly was one of the best !  We are very much looking forward to coming back!"

Jean Georges,50,Outstanding food and service,The best dining experience in a long time. The food is to die for and everything else is spectacular. This restaurant sets the bar pretty high on food and service not to mention the 2 Michelin stars this restaurant has.  From the moment you enter this restaurant you get a sense of the attention to detail and the overt the top hospitality. The beverage offerings are extensive and the wine list is impressive. But what’s most impressive about the restaurant is the menu offerings cater to a vegetarian with equally respectful and tantalizing menu offerings as the non vegetarians.  The staff is well trained and did a great job keeping an eye on every detail of the course.  Nothing and I mean nothing on this menu was remotely mediocre. Every dish was carefully curated and presented with a lot of thought and detail.  My photos don’t do much justice to the food and plate ware.  Hats off to the team and the chefs for such an exotic and tasteful offering.  Look forward to a visit in the near future.

Jean Georges,30,Was maybe. Is no longer,Great places come and go. This is gone and still trying to be. It is interesting that the size course and ten course dinning room even in holiday time was not full. Frankly the well over priced wine list couple with the marginal food makes for a perfect expense account venue but better food does exist in many other City restaurants. Have a cocktail at the bar and run off to another spot for a reasonable meal far better prepared elsewhere.

Jean Georges,30,Nice but not thrilling,"There is a strong feeling here of someone pulling the same tricks over and over for too long. Some of the dishes (Cavier, sea trout) were weak. While others were nice, we expected more from this place."

Jean Georges,50,Possibly the best meal of my life!,Holy crap this was amazing. Went twice! Don't let the Trump Tower deter you. Everything melts in your mouth and looks so beautiful!

Jean Georges,50,Great Lunch,"Had the four-course prix fixe menu which was excellent. We were hungry when coming in but left pretty full. It was my daughter’s birthday and we were given an extra dessert to accompany the other two… I thought this was a very nice gesture. Overall, the food is delicious and the restaurant is lovely."

Jean Georges,50,Still among the best in Manhattan,"Lunch prix fixe is a nice deal and an elegant experience. The room has nice light, the service impeccable and the food is terrific and memorable."

Jean Georges,50,Fabulous lunch (again),"While the price has climbed over the years, the food quality, preparation and service remain outstanding. You'll want to visit!"

Jean Georges,30,Mediocre lunch and experience,"We were here recently for lunch and I would have to say that it was just an ok experience. We were with our 12 year old and hence, opted for the Nougantine side.    We ordered the peakytoe crab cake, the tomato soup, warm schrimp salad, fried calamari, the veal, hake fish and cheeseburger. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake, grape tart and the butterscotch pudding.    The crab cake had a weird off putting taste to it but the tomato soup was delicious. Hake fish was a disappointment - it was a. tiny piece, wet and lumpy. Not what I would expect at an establishment like this. Veal was ok. My son seemed to enjoy his chocolate cake but the other two desserts were forgettable.    Overall, it was just an average lunch. We were expecting to be wowed after reading reviews about this place....perhaps we just picked the wrong dishes."

JoJo,50,we love this place!,"Have been going to Jo Jo's for many years. It continues to be excellent in every way (except maybe a bit too crowded and somewhat noisy)...The food, service, drinks...everything is fantastic..we love this place"

JoJo,20,Little bar,Used to be good for singles to eat but now-is service bay and messy. Has Jean George been keeping a watch on what goes?

JoJo,40,"Classy ambience, good food","I was very impressed with the classy ambience and beautiful architecture/exterior of Jojo, but I was a bit disappointed with my eggs Benedict. I’ve definitely had better renditions of this dish at less fancy/expensive places. I did, however, really enjoy my cocktail and cappuccino."

JoJo,50,Lovely!,Lovely! We stopped in for lunch and was wonderfully surprised with this restaurant! We had never been and didn’t know what to expect. Great atmosphere and the food was exquisite.

JoJo,50,A beautiful late lunch,"We had been mentally promising ourselves to make a point of returning here after an amazing dinner about a year ago. With no good excuse, it took us all of that time to return, and this time for a late lunch. Knowing that this peachy/rosey/creamy-hued restaurant can get very crowded, we purposefully booked a very late lunch time and were glad we did as by the time we arrived there were maybe one or two other tables in the ground floor dining room.    We got seated at a banquette table and were pleasantly surprised there was a Restaurant Week menu, so we took advantage of that. Not surprising was that everything was really delicious. First they happily accommodated my request to take a non-alcoholic cucumber mint soda they make and add some gin to it for me. Yum.  For lunch I had the Greek beet salad, salmon with ginger/chili, and a passion fruit pavlova I still dream about. Loved the big irregularly edged coffee cups.    Service was enthusiastic and knowledgeable and mostly attentive. It was just a lovely relaxed lunch in a comfortable setting that was modern and warm at the same time. And the food was fantastic."

JoJo,50,Back again!,"Back in NYC , November and December...we ate at JoJo in November and it was so delicious we made reservations for dinner for our December visit and included New York City friends...when we arrived, our fried asked about the possibility of moving us to a quieter space in the restaurant so her husband, who was on his way, could hear our conversations...the did heck and all tables were booked...we ordered our drinks and the hostess came and said there had been a cancellations and she could move us to the back table....perfect place for us to be to catch up after not having seen each other in a year...quieter corner, very comfortable banquette seating...the staff were very attentive, just the right amount of checking back to see what if anything was needed...the Butterscotch Pudding dessert is divine as well as everything else we had!...this will be a must on our next NYC visit!...this is just a lovely restaurant in a brownstone ...can be very lively in noise so book a quiet table area!"

JoJo,50,Beautiful Christmas lunch,"I had the please of spending a few hours here with my 3 adult kids for Christmas lunch. The service was impeccable and the surroundings pleasant and comfortable with the ambience making it feel like a special day. We found the people working here so lovely and the food, which was a 3 course prix fixe meal with many options for us to choose. My boys enjoyed their Wagyu beef tenderloin very much to the point they thought it was the best they had ever had, with the desserts being absolutely sensational, where I had a Gingerbread bundt cake with cranberry sorbet. Visiting New York from Australia and looking for a special Christmas lunch experience for my family, this is exactly what we received. I would highly recommend a visit to Jo Jo Restaurant any time. Just beautful."

JoJo,50,Fabulous cozy yummy Brunch Spot,"Fabulous little restaurant for brunch. The servings were just right! The coffee was hot & smooth served in handmade ceramic mugs from Iceland. We were seated in a cozy booth, quiet and romantic. Service was fantastic!!"

JoJo,20,Thanks giving rush,Went on Thanks giving with my 2 daughters. Spend almost 600 dollars which is fine. Food Okay. Service good but dinner was So rushes it was very unpleasent. I put my spoon down from eating my soup and my main course was already on the table.. I told them I wanted time between the courses and the manager came but she did nothing. I slowed down the dessert but still we where out of the door within 1.5 hour. This was not the experience I was hoping for. Lovely restaurant lovely waitres but to gready for cash on Thanks giving. We are from Europe and I think for a nice dinner 2 hours is the minimum and 15 to 20 min between starter and main is a must.

JoJo,50,Pre Theatre Dinner,"Arrived for the first seating at 5:30 PM, enjoyed starter of warm seafood salad, entree of Porcini crusted salmon and had time for a cup of coffee (could've ordered dessert if we wanted). Never were rushed, walked a block to the subway and in 15 minutes were in our seats at Come from Away. Perfect start to a memorable evening."

JoJo,20,Rushed service and hit and miss,"Just returned from an evening at Jojos as an international visitor to NY. Evening started very well with a drink at bar having turned up for 7:30 table at 7:15. Tuna starter was excellent however my partner was very disappointed that crab dumplings were not available (had been eyeing up for weeks) and her choice of alternative fell short. Main of duck breast was excellent though I found the lobster average, chips poor and not sure about ketchup with lobster, mayo would have been better. Again mains cleared within seconds of us finishing. We sat tight before ordering desert which arrived very promptly but both were excellent (pavlova and bread pudding). Check was presented as soon as deserts finished no offer of tea, coffee etc. For a meal for 2 costing significantly in excess of 300 USD I wouldn’t expect to be rushed out in under 80 mins, though the crush at the tiny bar as we left indicated to me that they had taken on significantly too many bookings and were rushing people through to compensate. A great shame as what should have been a very special evening left us feeling distinctly underwhelmed."

JoJo,20,Sic Transit Gloria JoJo,"We have been going to JoJo's since it first opened; live right up the street. Its latest transformation is terrible; looks like a diner and the food struggles to be mediocre. Some of Jean George's other restaurants, like The Mark and Nougatine are still pretty good, but I rate this one XXX"

JoJo,50,Simply perfect in all ways.,"What can you say about a JGV restaurant other than from the minute you walk in the door it is sheer perfection. The room is small but there is an upstairs. Service is perfect and everyone is accommodating. The food is so on point. So delightful and delicious. This is a must eat at, lovely to sit and unwind and without a doubt a great place.  I did the best I could with photos in a dark room. Apologies.  Please follow @joannasable on instagram for more food and travel fun."

JoJo,50,Loved JoJo!,"Such a beautiful setting in the Upper East Side. We loved everything about our brunch at JoJo. The home is beautiful renovated to be a beautiful, but cozy restaurant. The food was delicious and staff helpful and attentive. Loved the unique touches, like the beautiful bread and butter plates, colorful mugs, interesting decor, etc. Such a great spot in the city!"

JoJo,50,A Hidden Gem,"JoJo's was recommended to us by a friend who lived in NY before moving to the UK. From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed and ""at home"". The service throughout was impeccable with great recommendations a good wine choice and a friendly albeit private atmosphere. The food was absolutely exquisite. We'd definitely go again."

Komegashi,50,Favorite date night spot,My boyfriend and I have been coming here for a long time now and are always so satisfied with the service and the quality of the food. Everything is delicious and staff is always friendly; absolutely love coming here!

Komegashi,50,Beef Tokyo Fusion,I really enjoyed my takeout. Everything was fresh and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Fast service. Prices reasonable for the area.

Komegashi,50,Super Sushi Lunch!,"Make a reservation or get there at noon as it can get crowded. Lunch special is a good value, but tuna tacos are a favorite. Tasty Japanese fare. Great service."

Komegashi,50,Another great meal,"After a very busy July and busy week, wanted to enjoy a nice sushi dinner with a view of NYC. Always has great sushi and food. Service is consistently good and staff is friendly. Another great meal."

Komegashi,40,"Fair Prices, Fast service, Fresh not frozen","Reasonable view of the Hudson, but not great. Had the Miso soup and the pick 3 roll meal. Fish was fresh and not frozen. Fast service and Fair Price"

Komegashi,30,Overpriced!,"We ordered dinner delivery to our hotel after a long flight. The total came to $92, not including tip, which sounded reasonable, given that we ordered 6 sushi rolls, a dumpling appetizer, a teriyaki entree, 3 miso soups, and 2 house salads. Imagine our surprise...More"

Komegashi,50,Good views and sushi,"Views direct to freedom tower. Nice atmosphere , good food and service. Enjoyed meal and lication v much"

Komegashi,50,Nice Sushi in JC,Had some nice Sushi walking distance to my temporary apartment. Nothing super fancy but great for a quick meal

Komegashi,40,Plain exterior belies a good sushi experience... never judge by appearances,"Quite a good value with better quality fish in the sushi. Dinner for two and a reasonable price with very attentive service, a definitely strong repeat candidate."

Komegashi,20,Search for authentic Japanese cuisine outside NYC continues....,"Nice service, nice view, not a Japanese kitchen so the food did not really taste that Japanese. Good sake list, charming waitress asked us if we wanted our diaginjo warmed, which tells you the whole problem with this place and why we won't go back."

Komegashi,50,Amazingly authentic Japanese food!,"This restaurant was so wonderful, we ate here twice in one week. Amazing views of the yachts in the harbor. Wait staff was wonderful, and attentive. Food was delicious!"

Komegashi,40,Good oriental food,The food was good and the service nice. The place is ok even it's a bit dark and not so nicely decorated

Komegashi,50,Great sushi in Jersey City!!,"Small, but nicely decorated. Excellent and attentive wait-staff. The food was fantastic!! Excellent rolls. Fresh and tasty fish and shellfish. Seaweed salad was great. Prices very reasonable. Overall, a fantastic dining experience"

Komegashi,50,"Excellent Sushi, and great ambiance","What a great place to enjoy really good Sushi. From the outside it looks average, but once you get inside you quickly realize it is a great Sushi place. Food was excellent, free Edamame, and great service."

Komegashi,40,Food and service are good,We ordered a variety of dishes. The best ones are their salads and sushi/sashimi. Their black cod and tempura dishes are also very good.

Komegashi,40,Great sushi,"Get a table by the window for a view of the yachts and NYC! Wonderful food, good sake, nice service."

Komegashi,30,Pretty good,They do have tamari for the gluten free crowd and the sushi is pretty good. Service for take out is kind of rude and it isn't inexpensive.

Komegashi,50,Best Japanese cuisine in the locality at a fabulous location on the Marina,"This is an old favorite of ours, located right at the Newport Marina, with a great view of Manhattan across the Hudson. The food is usually very good, as is the service."

Komegashi,40,Great Sushi in Jersey City,Great place and much nicer than the original. Friendly staff and good happy hour. Lunch is really good also. I you like Japanese you will really like this place.

Komegashi,50,Good value & food is good,The sushi is fresh & sake is chilled right Dessert - served Lady M cake & a must after the meal Waitress is very friendly & excellent service

Komegashi,50,Great food and atmosphere,Food was well prepared and presented. Atmosphere is welcoming and the views on the bay at night are beautiful. Service was great. Mica took good care of us. We will definitely go back.

Komegashi,50,Great.,"If you are Sushi lover like I am, this place is a must. They have really great sushi, and also great service. I am there mainly the Sushi or Drinks, but everything else is pretty good too."

L'Entrecote,40,Great venue for lunch or dinner,"Visited during the rugby world cup. Queue only, no bookings. Had lunch, queued for 15 mins.  Lovely building over various floors. Start with salad, then steak & chips only option. Comes on plate, with extra platter of meat. As many extra chips as you want. Food very tasty.  Fast service, friendly staff. Great fun. Worth a visit."

L'Entrecote,50,Absolutely worth waiting for.,"Absolutely worth waiting for. The meat, the sauce, the fries were so good. Even the salad was delicious. We ordered one of the best red wines. Everyone was friendly and worked swiftly. Total experience 5 of 5."

L'Entrecote,30,"Great steak experience, but not a great restaurant experience","We'd been told that we'd have to queue for L'Entrecote, but that it would be a fantastic steak experience, so we dutifully joined the already very long queue ahead of opening time, snaking round on to Rue Esprit des Lois.    We were informed by a member of staff that the first service was full, so we would be waiting for about an hour. Fortunately, our two young children managed the wait and we were eventually ushered into the restaurant and instructed to proceed to 'le derniere étage' (top floor) and seated by a waitress who was clearly harried and rushed off her feet.    Since there the menu is famously salad followed by steak frites, the only questions were regarding cuisson (saignant, obviously) and drinks.    Salad was plonked down in front of us, and our drinks eventually arrived. Decent salad, nothing fancy.    What you're really here for, however, is the steak. How was that? Well, it arrived, sliced and smothered in the buttery sauce that makes L'Entrecote and similar restaurants famous. It was perfectly cooked, as you'd expect, and the sauce set it off beautifully. Frites were bottomless and delicious with the sauce.    All sounds OK, right? Well, yes. It's OK, but only OK. The wait was long, service was perfunctory at best, the atmosphere was taken over by a noisy group of twenty-somethings who were celebrating a birthday extremely loudly and drunkenly, and all for effectively, steak frites.    Decent as it was, we had better steak elsewhere, with far better service, without the long wait and with far nicer atmosphere. A case of style or hype over substance in our opinion.    We've ticked the L'Entrecote experience off the list now, but it's not one we'll be needing to repeat."

L'Entrecote,10,A new low in customer service,"To say that we were treated poorly at your restaurant would be a gross understatement. We waited for 1 hour to get a table and the person who was supposed to be front of house, totally ignored us. To say that his behaviour upset myself and my friends isn’t even close. I have never in my life been disrespected like this. You should be ashamed of the behaviour of this person. I cannot explain how poorly we were treated in words, this is totally unacceptable."

L'Entrecote,50,"Yes, it really is as good as they say!","It is as good as everyone says. 40 minute wait but worth it. Don't expect fine dining and silver service ( though the service was very good). It's simple food, but extraordinarily done. There is salad, steak and fries plus amazing desserts.That's it. The secret steak sauce is the star of the show, and the salad is simple ( lettuce and walnuts) but the dressing is amazing. and no-one does frites better than the French. do yourself a favour and have the house red as well, its smooth and very drinkable."

L'Entrecote,40,Worth the queue,Simple food well cooked. Little choice but the food and wine were very good.pleasant staff. All these people can't be wrong.

L'Entrecote,50,"A lovely evening, I will be back!","Queued for almost an hour but it was worth it! Delicious food with as many chips as you want! Reasonably priced. A lovely evening, I will be back!"

L'Entrecote,50,5/5,Definitely worth the wait and the steak was one of the best I’ve ever eaten. The sauce was divine. The steak was cooked to perfection aswell.

L'Entrecote,50,Simply fantastic,Fantastic restaurant. There is usually a long queue and worth the wait. As someone who rarely eats steak/ Bavette I finished the whole lot due to it amazing sauce. A simple concept done extremely well. Dessert is also very fab . Bon appetite 😀

L'Entrecote,50,As good as ever! Worth queuing..,"We'd been to other Entrecotes so thought we would give the Bordeaux venue a try. However, it was a very warm night so we didn't fancy queuing. Instead we waited in a bar on the place de la comédie having a refreshing drink until 6.55pm (it opened at 7) and the queue looked big! We got in and were delighted that the Bordeaux offering was as good as elsewhere! As always great salad & steak, alongside a recommended bottle of wine, you can't go wrong with this restaurant!"

L'Entrecote,50,Very unique,"Really interesting and unique idea! You don’t get a choice in the menu but the steak and chip are gorgeous! Very reasonably priced also, would definitely go back. We only queued for 30mins"

L'Entrecote,50,A must visit in Bordeaux 😋,"What an experience L’Entrecote Bordeaux is! We had a delightful time with delicious steak and fries. Excellent service. You have to queue up, however at 12 noon when the restaurant opens we were seated and served our entree salad very quickly. They are well organised. The profiteroles for dessert was amazing and very large. Thanks for a lovely time."

L'Entrecote,50,The best steak and frites!,"After hearing we might have to queue for up to 30 mins we were pleased to walk in with no queue on a really busy day in Bordeaux at lunch.    Our waiter looked after us very well, our orders were taken quickly and arrived just as fast.    The food was amazing! Unlimited fries and extra servings of steak went down perfectly, the sauce was so tasty and perfect to scoop up with the chips. Even the simple salad starter had a really nice dressing.    Tons of variety in desserts for only €7 which all looked great although I didn’t try one.    The photos don’t do it justice, this place lived up to the hype!"

L'Entrecote,30,Cheap steak and chips,"The best thing to say is it’s cheap. Bordeaux has many good restaurants and if you’re away for the weekend, save your time and don’t queue here to save a few euros and go somewhere else. Steak n chips is all the do"

L'Entrecote,50,Perfect Steak Frites!!!,This a fabulous restaurant with only one option - steak frites.  It is a simple meal done perfectly. There is a choice of wine - by the glass or bottle and choice of 7 or so desserts. The steak was cooked exactly as requested. It is very popular and line ups start outside before it opens.  Highly recommended - but only if you like steak frites!!  The staff are great too!!

L'Entrecote,50,Steak and chips Bordeaux style,"My partner and I git there 20 minutes before opening, sizeable queue which moved really quickly once the place opened, lovely starts let but the main was fantastic. Lovely service, left well fed!!"

L'Entrecote,40,Not fine dining but…,"Absolutely hysterical. We’d never heard of Entrecôte until we saw people queuing for lunch the previous day. Decided to give it a try the next night for dinner. Arrived at 6:15pm for the 7pm opening and there was already a queue. Got straight in at 7pm and it is literally steak and chips with a salad served as an entree, with more chips provided as required. There are a range of desserts but we had chocolate mousse and profiteroles. Not sure if there was a wine list. We just had a bottle from the list (one white, one red) that was on the wall. A couple of cognacs to finish with the Irish guys on the table next to us and off we went. Fine dining it ain’t but comfort food it is."

L'Entrecote,40,Great food at a reasonable price,"We joined a short line for about 30 minutes before opening and the dinner was definitely worth it. Professional and courteous staff served the melt in the mouth steak. Not a Michelin restaurant but it is fun , exciting and most importantly tasty food. PS the house wine is great value. Go on treat yourself."

L'Express,40,Profiterols are a must,"I found the food to be high level and tasty but seriously, come for the Profiterols!!! we may have gone a little crazy with the desserts and I would also recommend the Rice Pudding."

L'Express,50,70th Birthday Celebration,"It was fabulous from start to finish! The cocktails, the meal, the service and the ambience were all top notch. We were celebrating my 70th birthday and my nephew recommended L’express. What a wonderful evening! It definitely was one of the highlights of my vacation! 👍👍"

L'Express,50,Fabulous Culinary Experience,"We had a magnificent dinner at this establishment even though we were seated at the bar.    Our bartender was amazing, totally engrossed with satisfying his clientele and fluid in motion, nothing phased him, a delight and privilege to witness.    As a whole, the atmosphere was almost electric and the food came out as if from a well oiled machine boasting quality and deliciousness, if and when I return to Montreal, this restaurant will be a definite destination. YUM"

L'Express,40,Iconic Restaurant,"L’Express is very French. There is no sign out front to identify the restaurant. The setting was lovely, the food & wine “just right”. It was perfect right down to the snooty waiter."

L'Express,50,Excellent French restaurant!,"Came here o0n the recommendation of a Montreal native who has also spent a considerable amount of time in France. Ww arrived at about 1900 on a Tuesday night without reservations and were seated immediately at a two person table, with the caveat that we could only have the table until 2100. That proved to be plenty of time for dinner. The remaining tables were filled very shortly, this appears to be a very popular place.    The ambiance is small well established old french restaurant, if you didn't already know you were in Montreal, you'd think you were in France. There is a full bar, and the tables are packed pretty close. it is fairly loud as one might expect, but we were able to hold a conversation.    The service was uniformly excellent, attentive, gracious and friendly, and the staff was willing to work with my limited capacity to communicate well in french. The menu is offered in both french and english, but familiarization with french cooking terms is helpful.    The food was outstanding, met or exceeded our expectations, a true representation of French cuisine. Hot, fresh, delicious, served and presented beautifully. We both had a green salad, one of us had the poached salmon with chervil, and the other had a pan seared chicken dish. We both had dessert as well, the profiteroles were the stand-out here, but the creme boulle with honey ws excellent as well.    Based on the observations of others meals, it does not seem Riley you could go wrong here with just about anything you ordered.    We will definitely return her on our next trip to Montreal."

L'Express,50,"High quality, flavorful food with a fine dining feel","Exceptional dinner and the prices are fair considering the quality and portion size.    I ordered the roasted quail with wild rice ($35.00). The quail was an enhanced chicken wing, but the crispy skin and amazing sauce that was served with it took it over the top. I’m not sure what was in the sauce, but I could drink 2 cups of that stuff. It was amazing and so deep in flavor.    My mother got the chicken paillard ($27). I tried some and the chicken was very tender and I believe the dish also with the same sauce that I had. We like the mini stuffed tomatoes and the flavor of the dish overall was fantastic as well.    Great service all around from the bus boy, waiter and hostess.    The atmosphere is lively and has a fine dining field, but not stuffy. They accommodate tourist very well and have the menu in English."

L'Express,40,Feels like home,"After being away from Canada for 2 years, it felt great to visit this French bistro again. Not much has changed. The classics are still there. The soupe de poissons tasted amazing. L’os à moelle just has I remembered. Living in India you can image that I’m craving beef a lot. So the tartare was just the fix I needed. Could have used a little kick for a guy who’s been eating spicy Indian food for a while but the server never asked how I wanted it. The fries were great and crispy. The croque-monsieur left us wandering. Very hard and dry. Frankly have something else. Over all it felt good to be back. The atmosphere was vibrant even on this late afternoon during the week."

L'Express,50,Book it ASAP,"Arrived right on time for our reservation and were dismayed to see a line of eight or 10 people crushed inside the front door, waiting. But then we checked in with the maitre d' and, moments later, were whisked to the dining room's one open two-top. Folks in line were waiting (and waiting) for an opening at the bar! Moral of the story: make a reservation, well in advance, for this super-popular neighborhood spot, and you'll be fine. Food was classic French bistro fare nicely executed, service was friendly and professional, room was charming (if crowded). Great wine list -- be sure to check out the more reasonably priced bottles on the flip side of the dinner menu."

L'Express,30,Hit and miss,"I was not expecting haute cuisine, just good bistro fare, and a good thing. Appetisers--burrata and heirloom tomatoes, scallop and strawberry ceviche and bone marrow--were great (though I prefer my marrow bones split). Mains, not so much. Duck confit was actually dried out (how?), have had more tender hanger steak (and fries were about 30 seconds under-cooked), house ravioli was swimming in something that resembled mushroom consommé. Yuck. Dessert was the absolute winner--lemon tarte with white chocolate ganache and chocolate tarte. Both divine. Extensive wine list with reasonable bottles. Also loved the room--busy and loud but in a fun way. But mains were a big disappointment."

L'Express,50,Tried and true,This Montreal institution apparently has not changed one bit since it opened in 1980. It's a must. Food is bursting with flavor. Fabulous ingredients sourcing. It's always packed. Extensive wine selection. Friendly bar vibe. Great service. Go!

L'Express,30,Mixed experience,"Very mixed experience. Wanted to love this restaurant as it came so highly recommended. While the food tasted good, it took 30 minutes to receive our entree and over an hour more (!) to receive our main courses. We were two people. It was ridiculous."

L'Express,40,"Good food, big crowd!","This restaurant uses every square inch of its space and tends to make one feel crowded and cramped. The food is good and the waitstaff attentive. They serve bread, mustard, and pickles as a starter. The quiche was good but a bit overcooked. Beet salad was fresh, tasty, and light. Quail with endive was tasty and cooked well. Chocolate tart with ice cream ended the meal nicely."

L'Express,20,Mixed experience,"Has been in l'Express many times over many years. This time on a visit from out of town.  Mixed experience with food. Excellent fish soup! Kidneys overcooked (asked for undercooked) and not in mustard sauce. If not pressed for time would have returned it,  Other clients have had similar experience. Do not order kidneys sauce moutarde! Not acceptable for a quality bistro. Otherwise, l'Express has not changed. Still very noisy."

L'Express,50,Great gem of a neighborhood restaurant,Great French Bistro that is frequented by locals. Great menu. Great wine list. Very nice helpful staff. Wonderful food! Would definitely return.

L'Express,50,Very nice meal and top notch service.,"This place lives up to it's reputation as a classic French bistro. The food was delicious, the service was excellent and prices are moderate. Highly recommended"

L'Express,50,Just wow!,We had a family dinner at this restaurant as we stayed in Montreal. The atmosphere is casual but with fine dining flavor. The service is very friendly and quick. The menu has great french cuisine options. Each of us tried different dishes. They all were presented delicately and tasted great. Highly recommend

L'Express,40,Genre-Defining Staple,"If anyone were to ask me to define a bistro, it’d be easier to just bring them here.    Well-worn but clean, cramped space. Professional, efficient service. Fairly expected menu executed just about perfectly    Of note. This is the cheapest place to drink great wine in Montreal. Established collectible names at very fair prices    You get a huge jar of pickles and mustard when you order w a simple baguette (no heirloom grains, no sourdough, just a good baguette).    Definitely get a rillettes or tartare to start.  Octopus w piperade was wonderful  Hanger steak w fries. Fries are excellent  Poached salmon w chervil. Excellent salmon cook and a decent chervil mashed potato. Duck confit. Decent execution of a classic bistro dish.    I wish I worked in this neighborhood so I could come for lunch twice a month    Worth noting the neighboring cafe is garbage and you’d do better to stay at l’express for an espresso and profiteroles than going elsewhere."

L'Express,40,Typical French bistro experience,"Everything reminds you of a typical French bistro.  Needless to say our waiter was outstanding.  Because they had a delay in the dessert, they had it on the house…this is the kind of treatment that says a lot about the place.  My tartare was excellent and everyone enjoyed their meal. Every dish was predictable which the only negative as I would have liked a little bit of a twist."

L'Express,10,"A truly French dining experience from the 1980's, warts and all","I was very fortunate to secure a last minute spot at the counter at L'Express which has garnered fame from many a chef, food critics, and TV personalities. A Montreal institution, it has been recommended as one of THE places to go to for quintessential French bistro fare this side of the Atlantic (in Canada at least). As a prior Montreal native when I was a student many years ago, I had always wished for the opportunity to pay L'Express a visit and see what had and has given it such enduring staying power. So when I was able to get a spot during my short stay in Montreal, I eagerly anticipated what would be the cherry on top to close out a wonderfully pleasant and charming little holiday.    Upon arriving, I told the maître d'hôtel that I'd made a reservation for the counter. He brought me to the half empty bar seating, where there was one Asian diner sitting right in the middle of. Of the three open seats on either side of her, the maître d'hôtel glanced at the empty seats for a split second and decided to seat me right next to her. Initially it set off a small red flag, was I being seated next to her because I looked Asian? Did he think she needed the company of someone who looked to be of the same ethnicity as her? I brushed it off, thinking that perhaps there was some other logical reason and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. After being attended to by the polite but curt main waiter behind the counter, I decided to ask him if I could just shift over one seat as no one had come to fill it in the 15 minutes since the first service began. Without a smile or any effort to accommodate my request, he told me that no, I could not because it was reserved for another party. At the same time, another single diner came in who was seated in the middle of the three available seats to the left of the other Asian diner. She had an empty seat on both sides of her. And she was white. I started to pay more attention to how my fellow Asian diner was being served, and noted that the waiter barely spoke a word to her, except to ask her what dessert she wanted. He took her empty plate from her without asking if she was done, unceremoniously and wordlessly plopped the dessert menu in front of her and went about waiting on the rest of the guests at the counter. With the other guests he was a little bit more chatty, although he did stop short of being warm or friendly.    A couple did end up being seated in the two empty seats next to me near the end of my meal. But this still didn't explain why I couldn't be moved over to the far seat, still allowing said couple to sit between the other Asian diner and myself. I also wasn't a walk-in and had made a reservation at around 12PM that day. If the maître d'hôtel was as experienced as he appeared, he could've easily figured out a way to accommodate my request to switch seats while still allowing the subsequent reservations to be seated appropriately. And if the couple who arrived later had had a reservation, the waiter could've offered me to switch seats until the time they were scheduled to arrive. Ultimately, there was no logical reason as to why my request to move seats was denied, except because of some subconscious (or conscious) bias.    As a frequent traveler and someone who's lived in Paris, I've experienced the kind of French service that many foreigners complain about. While servers in France can be infamously brusque and inattentive, they're typically brusque and inattentive to everyone, with no exceptions. As no stranger to true French service, my experience at L'Express couldn't just be chalked up to ""just typical French service"", unless the Montreal variety means that it's delivered with a generous dollop of racial discrimination. I was also keenly aware of the ""rules"". I understood that there is a no cellphone rule, and never laid my phone on the counter once during my meal. I dressed more formally than half the restaurant, didn't smell, and was properly groomed. I didn't make any disgruntled comments. I didn't skimp on my order, ordering wine pairings with each of my courses. I didn't make a scene or complain. I even tipped them, but it was only so I didn't deprive the only waitress who actually provided good service of her well deserved tip.    Oh and I almost forgot about the food. I had the Duck Confit, which was good and generously portioned but nothing to write home about. The wine list is also one of the better ones I've seen. But if you're looking for a classic French dining experience in Montreal, you can do much better at one of the many other French restaurants in the city. Even if they gave me free meals for life, I would never step foot there again. For a restaurant as old as L'Express, one could expect a degree of degradation in either food or service. But ironically, it may be the restaurant staff's (hopefully unconscious?) clinging to rigid cultural beliefs and conservative mentalities that completely overshadowed what could have been a wonderful parting memory to end my Montreal visit. Reputation can only get a restaurant so far and to have to grit my teeth and bear such an uncomfortable and upsetting dinner because of racial prejudice is unacceptable and inexcusable. It was unacceptable then in 1980 and even more so now in 2022."

L'Express,40,Great vibe but disappointed in the menu,"Going to L’express is a tradition for us when we are in Montreal. We got a table around 10pm and it was busy as ever. Very lively vibe and we ended up talking with a nice elderly couple at the next table, which is easy as the tables are all close together.    Service was good, but the menu has changed since our last visit pre Covid. Gone were some of the classic bistro items that we liked and were looking forward to.    But they still bring a jar of mini pickles (cornichons)!    Didn’t enjoy the food as much."

L'Express,10,Shame on L'Express!,"Shame on L’Express! (French review below)    L’Express is known as an ‘institution’ in Montreal. But BEWARE: it is not an inclusive, friendly place. I wanted to spend a lovely evening with friends while on a trip to Montreal in early November. I have a digestive disability, which means that I cannot eat food I do not prepare myself without risking hospitalization. We always call up to book in restaurants and explain that I must bring my own meal and am happy to pay a cover charge. In the three years since we’ve been doing this, no restaurant has ever objected. When booking at L’Express, the person told us that she’d never come across such a request but took the reservation saying that we’d hear back on email if there was a problem. No such email was ever received. The only email we received was to confirm the reservation the day before the booking. We therefore assumed that all was well.    We arrived at the restaurant and were seated. When the waiter appeared, we explained that I was the person with dietary restrictions who had brought their own meal. He looked surprised, we explained what had been agreed when we reserved, and he disappeared to speak to the Maître D. After much to-ing and fro-ing between waiter, Maître D and us, they eventually said that they’d ‘make an exception’, only to return a few minutes later to declare that they cannot accommodate our request which was simply to supply a bowl and a plate. They offered no explanation. Then they had the audacity to ask if we would still like to stay. We said no; they offered little apology and no compensation, such as paying for the aperitifs that our friends who arrived before us had ordered. My partner, who speaks French, had to request that they cover our friends’ aperitifs, which they did.    Overall, their behaviour around what should have been a minor issue was discourteous, condescending and humiliating. Imagine if you had a disability and you were made to feel guilty for it, to apologise for it, and to be refused minor reasonable accommodation for it? That’s what they did to me. They also cancelled our reservation on their booking system, making it impossible for us to leave a review of our experience on their website.    This is not a socially inclusive place, nor does it act in the spirit of the laws protecting people with disabilities in Quebec and Canada, including invisible disabilities such as digestive disabilities. Shame on L’Express!    * * *  Honte à L’Express!    L’Express est une ‘institution’ à Montréal. Mais attention : ce n’est pas un lieu inclusif ni aimable. J’ai voulu passé une belle soirée entre amies alors que je visitais Montréal au début de novembre. J’ai un handicap digestif, qui signifie que je ne mange que ce que je prépare moi-même sinon je risque l’hospitalisation. Nous appelons toujours les restaurants à l’avance expliquant ma situation et demandant si je peux apporter mon propre repas, et nous offrons toujours de payer un frais de service. Depuis trois ans que nous avons commencé cette pratique, aucun restaurant nous a refusé, ou même demandé de payer un frais de service. Lorsque nous avons réservé à L’Express, la personne nous a dit n’avoir jamais reçu une telle demande mais a accepté notre réservation nous disant que le restaurant communiquera avec nous par courriel s’il y a un problème. Nous n’avons jamais reçu in tel courriel; seulement un courriel la veille de la réservation pour la confirmer. Nous avons donc conclu que tout était beau.    Nous sommes arrivées au restaurant et on nous a mené à notre table. Quand le serveur s’est présenté, nous avons noté que je suis la personne qui a apporté son repas. Surpris, et après notre explication de la réservation, le serveur est disparu consulté la Maître D. Après plusieurs aller-retour entre serveur, Maître D et nous, ils ont enfin dit qu’ils ‘feraient une exception’ ce soir. Mais quelques minutes plus tard, ils nous apprennent qu’il ne peuvent pas accommoder ma simple demande d’un bol et une assiette. Ils ne nous ont offert aucune explication. Et ils ont eu le culot de nous demander si on voulait rester. Nour avons refusé; ils nous ont offert peu d’excuses et aucun compensation, tel qu’offrir les apéritifs que nos amies, arrivées avant nous, avaient commandés. C’est seulement lorsque ma conjointe leur a demandé de payer pour les apéros qu’ils ont accepté.    Somme toute, leur comportement autour de ce qui n’était qu’une requête mineure était impoli, condescendant, et humiliant. Imaginez que vous avez un handicap et qu’on vous fasse sentir coupable, obligé de vous excuser, et qu’on vous refuse de vous offrir un accommodement raisonnable mineur? C’est ce qu’ils ont fait à mon égard, alors que je ne voulais que passer une soirée entre amies. Ils ont également annulé notre réservation, ce qui veux dire qu’on ne peut pas laisser de commentaire sur leur système.    L’Express n’est pas un lieu socialement inclusif et n’honore pas l’esprit des lois québécoise et canadienne pour la protection de personnes handicapées, incluant les handicaps invisibles comme les handicaps digestifs. Honte à L’Express!"

L'Express,40,Fantastic French bistro dining experience! So worth it!,"Wonderful French bistro dining experience in this long-standing Montreal establishment. Love the black-and-white checkered tile floor and the elegant black and white framed photos on the wall.    It didn't bother us but please keep in mind of its tightly-spaced seating.    The wait staff was very professional, friendly, attentive and answered all our inquiries on the menu and checked on us during our lunch meal (not intrusive, just the right amount).    The waiter introduced to us a lovely, light, local Vin léger aromatisé àla pomme (light apple flavored wine), which we were told is not available at local SAQ.    We ordered the following:    Appetizers:  -Celeri remoulade (Celery remoulade),  -Mousse de foies de volaille aux pistaches (Chicken liver pâte with pistachios) and --Pieuvre grillee (Grilled octopus). We found the Romesco-like sauce was too salty.    Main dishes  -Cuisse de canard confite (Confit duck leg) and  -Onglet beurre echalote - frites (Hanger steak with shallot butter and fries)    Desserts  -profiteroles à l'érable (Maple profiteroles)  -tartelette citron, ganache au chocolat blanc (Lemon tart with white chocolate ganache)  -tarte au chocolat (Chocolate tart)    Be sure to book in advance as it is always very busy. Definitely recommend!!!"

L'Express,10,Salty experience !,"We went to eat at this restaurant yesterday around 6:00 p.m. We had been there many times over the past 20 years and couldn't wait to go back. What a disappointment, the starters seemed to have been prepared a long time in advance, as well as the dessert, the floating island. Nothing seemed to be cooked to order which makes everything taste bland. The worst of my experience is the terribly salty taste of my duck confit, almost inedible, but I ate it anyway because I was too embarrassed to return my dish, which I should have done thinking about it this morning . I still advised the server of this really too salty taste. And my spouse had severe food poisoning when he ate the celery remoulade and the beef tartare, the latter is made mechanically. We hadn't gone out to a restaurant since the pandemic and I regret this choice of restaurant because for $176.14, it's really a ""salty"" bill for such an experience! No, I do not recommend this restaurant."

L'Express,40,Busy and Tasty,"If all bistro dining was like this, I would love it. This isn't a fancy restaurant. Rather it's an energetic space, busy and buzzy with locals having animated conversations over terrific food. One of the dishes I had -- grilled salmon over lentils -- was so simple and yet expertly prepared so that the fish was moist and delicious and the lentils such a flavorful accompaniment. They also have an extensive and terrific wine list. The space is tight, noisy and minimalist, but there's a reason why it's so crowded -- and that's the food!"

L'Express,50,Unique experience in traditional cuisine,"Unique experience in traditional cuisine, where you can learn about the Canadian vision of French dishes.  Very professional and very friendly service in a place with elegant but cozy decoration.  Excellent dishes prepared and a very wide wine list. The quality of the team that served us, always full restaurant, is very close to excellence. Totally recommended in Montreal."

L'Express,30,Traditional French food Not for Vegans or Vegetarians,"L’Express is exactly what you would expect from a cramped space, too small tables, loud due to the vintage tile floors (this pretty much defines Paris bistro of a certain era)!    Bistros, such as this one, is intimate (smaller in size), served traditional fare and an extensive French wine list. You’ll find casual menu items but are not going to make vegans or vegetarians happy!!! My husband and I came here to make my 80 year old mother happy, she was moderately happy by the end of the meal ;)    The restaurant is in an average neighborhood, we could not shop after, not really a place to wander about after, we ended up driving to a new neighborhood to shop. However, we did not come to shop we came to eat French food.    The French cuisine is simple featuring basics like chicken liver pate with pistachios ($17), goat cheese in kataifi ($16), beet salad with Louis d’or ($15+).    My husband had coffee, I had tea and my mom had orange juice that she could not wait for me to take a photo of because it smelled like well, orange juice! She loved something so simple, it reminded her of her childhood, we bought her a juicer but she never uses it, doesn’t like to get it dirty!    We forgot to ask for the complimentary bread and house pickles that folks talk about, perhaps you should? Maybe they are life changing?    My mom had the chicken with potatoes, she seemed to enjoy, she was quiet, does not happen often.    I had a salad and they removed the meat and my husband had the beet salad. Again with traditional French food no one cares about vegans and vegetarians but perhaps you could have one option?    Very polite staff but for us without my mother no reason to go back."

L'Express,50,Wonderful Bistro Experience,"We found this place during a holiday in Montreal. We had a great lunch and booked to return 2 days later for another lunch that was, if anything, better. We have eaten in a lot of bistros in France and this fits the bill. Good ingredients treated sympathetically with professional yet friendly service. Very rare for us to return anywhere so quickly but pleased we did.    I enjoy my wine and found that the specialist wine list..available on request contained some great bargains"

L'Express,40,Tight fit at bar,"Being solo I opted for a bar seat when making reservation. Food (green salad, veal kidneys and frites) was well prepared and presented. Only complaint is that the bar seats are very close together, and spent most of my meal time trying not to bump elbows with my fellow diners."

L'Express,50,"Telepathic service, a perfect meal","Best meal we had in Montreal. Possibly the best service ever. The waitstaff have excellent timing and are always checking if you need something without being intrusive. The food and beverages were all on point. We started with the grilled octopus, bone marrow, goat cheese in kataifi crust followed by the hanger steak, raviolis, and quail. Dessert was the chocolate tart and maple syrup ice cream. Had an old fashioned and a nice glass of Bordeaux. While we did not have the best ever in any category, everything was well balanced and delicious. Seasoning and temperature were spot on for everything. Wonderful meal."

L'Express,50,Great French food!,"We came here because our daughter and son-in-law came here and loved the restaurant. We were not disappointed. The green salad was very tasty, and big enough to share. I enjoyed the grilled salmon with lentils and my husband loved the roasted cod. The service was very efficient. When it was time to leave, the owner called a cab which never came, and then went into the street to personally get one. He really went out of his way for us. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."

L'Express,50,FANTASTIC,"We got a recommendation from the train conductor on our way to Montreal from Quebec City. This was really worth going to. We had a very nice lunch, fantastic food and the service was excellent. Try the Celery Remoulade (very French and very different) The cold Cauliflower soup was equally good and my husband's Croque Monsier was terrific. It was an hour walk from our hotel but well worth it."

L'Express,50,Old world charm meets a Bistro with a twist,"This restaurant is almost hidden from view and if you don’t look down you’ll miss the name…..  Please, look down and don’t miss this experience for any reason.  My wife and I have enjoyed visiting France on a number of occasions and the one thing we love is Bistro style dining.  l’Express is a wonderful throw back to how Bistros are meant to be, lots of people enjoying excellent food in a very simple surrounding.  I started with the Liver Mousse and my wife had the fresh goat cheese in pastry, both dishes were excellent.  For our mains I had the Quail special and my wife had the Sage/Lemon chicken dish, again perfectly prepared and presented.  The wine list was simply amazing and we enjoyed a few bottles of extremely tasty offerings.  Save room for desert if you can, they have great choices and both the Lemon Tartlet and Maple Ice cream were excellent."

L'Express,50,C'est Fantastique!,"After a dozen visits to Montreal, I finally had the chance to dine at L'Express. And readers, it did not disappoint. C'est fantastique!    Tip: Do try at least one selection from their specials. I had heirloom tomatoes (selected that morning at Jean-Talon Market) with burrata. Simply divine."

L'Express,50,"Best meal in North America, by a million miles","Their Isle Flotant is the best desert I have ever had. I lived in NYC for 4 years, live in SF now, travel to Europe (and France) at least 1-2x/year, and this is the best restaurant in North America.    Amazing venison, beautifully executed classic dishes, perfect HORIZONTALLY (cross-cut) beef bone maximizes the easy marrow extraction (so much better than lengthwise or diagonal cut as other restaurants do). We are not big on heavy steaks and rich French food, and yet this is so perfectly done and amazing we have to say it's the best meal we've had in this continent."

L'Express,50,Quality food and Atmosphere,Nice authentic French bistro atmosphere with delicious good quality food. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice.

L'Express,50,Outstanding in every way,"This small restaurant is superb in every way. Our waiter, Xavier, and the team supporting him were attentive, prompt and helpful with recommendations and answers about the menu. His good sense of humour was icing on the cake. The prices seemed very reasonable for food of such high quality. The chicken liver pate is outstanding. Our party enjoyed the duck, the hanger steak frit, cold beef and salad and quail. Each of us raved about how perfectly prepared and presented the dishes were. The duck confit was the best I’ve ever had. Pardon my English translation to Rice Pudding, but the riz au lait avec flour de sel was a caramel enhanced delight. Save room and don’t miss the creme caramel l’orange. Out of this world! Wonderful wine list, not overpriced. This place exceeded all expectations and we will return first chance we get. Bravo!"

L'Express,10,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,1 star is to much. It was a horrible experience. Left without eating Food was absolutely disgusting Do not go here!

L'Express,50,Outstanding classically prepared French food with an Amazing wine selection!,"I know this is a classic place that every chef has to dine at while in Montreal but it's also great for just the regular person to. I was warned that the service could be slightly rude but I found it to be efficient, authentic and charming. It is definitely meant to be a ""French diner"" experience from, from the view point of an regular American. The wine list was amazing; not that it had a catalog of thousands of different wines with vintages from over the years. The list had many classic French wines that only person with extensive wine knowledge may appreciate but also many wines that anyone could appreciate at very reasonable prices. The food was spot, great French comfort food."

L'Express,20,Definitely Not Recomended,"We very disappointed by L’Express bistro. We found it to be very overrated, with mediocre food but sky-high prices. First of all, the menu was surprisingly narrow for a Parisian-style bistro — there was no escargot, oysters, rabbit or other must-have bistro items. We ordered steak tartare, sorrel soup, fish soup and quiche. The fish soup was tasteless and had no discernible seafood flavor. It tasted like a cheap condensed soup with water added. The sorrel soup was okay, but nothing special. The steak tartare was blah, actually the worst tartare I’ve ever tried. It had no real flavor — all I could taste is red chili pepper, which is a weird ingredient for steak tartare. Good tartare should be slightly salty, slightly lemony, and slightly mustard flavored. It shouldn’t been chili-pepper-flavored and muddy looking! And the quiche was completely nondescript and bland — exactly the same as a slice of quiche you’d get at a fast-food place.    Also, the price was almost overwhelming for this so-so, nothing special food.    The interior of the restaurant is charming, and the service was superb. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. But in terms of the food, we felt strongly that this restaurant is coasting on its reputation. Definitely not recommended."

L'Express,40,Fresh food and friendly service,Portions are small but tasty and all fresh. Measures are taken to avoid the Covid. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Prices are high for the portions

L'Express,30,"Nice main course, poor starter and dessert","The service and staff is good but the food didn't reach my expectation. Foie-gras was very average, a bit disappointing for a 25$ starter. The lemon chicken was tender and well-made, no big surprise but it does the job correctly. And finally the Ile-Flottante, not enough cream, flooded with huge/hard caramel chunks. Good wine list though. Overly too expensive for what was delivered, I am afraid there are a lot of better options in Montreal for that price range."

L'Express,50,Consistently good,"This place is a Montreal institution. It has been in continuous operation for close to 40 years. I have been coming to it for over thirty years, never having lived in Montreal.    The service is consistently good, the food of high quality and the room is inviting.    The core menu does not change, but there are always specials that are on offer which provide a change from the core menu.    My favorite dishes are steak tartare and marrow bones, both are excellent and rarely available in restaurants where I live. So I have to make a pilgrimage."

L'Express,40,Nice experience for me....,"I was craving boudin that day (our second day in Montreal) and went with my bf (who is French) to have lunch there. The menu was in French and English, and they also had another one with Spanish/German/Italian. They translated boudin as ""black pudding"" which I think is not accurate at all. My dish was  wonderful, a ""deconstructed"" boudin presented as a pudding. My bf said his dish was a bit undercooked (it was similar to a guinea fowl), I had a bite and it was very tasty. Appetizers and dessert were good but not amazing. Service was very friendly. The place is very light at lunch and aside from the pictures on the wall it did not give me strong bistro vibes (my French bf agreed).  All in all, I would definitely go back for the boudin."

L'Express,20,Went to a cocktail with my,"Went to a cocktail with my husband at the bar, we did not feel welcomed in the establishment.  Very cold staff at the bar. I will not go back there for a meal. Dining is an experience and not only the food that encompasses the experience but the atmosphere and service"

L'Express,50,Real Parisian ambiance in North America and food to die for !,"L’Express is a Parisian-style bistro serving the best of French food in an exceptional bistro space with checkered floors & a bar. It has been a Montreal institution since the 1980s and has not slowed down at all! It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a hot spot for celebrities and people about town, including Celine Dion. You definitely need a reservation, unless you are good with eating at the bar, which is first come first serve. The chic waiters are all dressed in the Parisian style with long aprons and ties and they glide between the tables. The food, service and styling is all amazing. French cornichons and hot mustard are served on every table, like in Paris. I have eaten here many times, and have tried most of the menu. I recommend the oysters, the fish soup, l’entrecôte, the ravioli and the profiteroles. They also have a huge wine list and cave with over 11,000 bottles of wine. No matter what you order, you’ll have a great meal and real Paris ambiance in North America."

La Goulue,40,A good lunch,"Cosy place with a particularly nice, smiling and efficient service, this restaurant offers a nice menu with seafood and great fish. Meat lovers will find a couple of dishes to satisfy their appetite too.  A decent selection of wines helped to go through the tasteful lunch we had, and at a very decent price; 30 euros for a good and filling meal."

La Goulue,30,It was okey,"The food was okey , but kinda overpriced . The service was nice but I find it hard to order since there was not a menu in English ."

La Goulue,10,Rude,"Having spent a beautiful weekend experiencing the delights of Biaritz this restaurant was a very poor experience.  The staff were rude and did not offer a warm welcome.  My food was returned and when It returned I explained my husband had now finished his meal, to which she replied with a shrug of the shoulders. The steak was still poor and we asked for the bill.  A very poor experience!!!"

La Goulue,50,Highly recommended,"La Goulue is a lovely,inviting restaurant. The warm colours and the old photographs of Biarritz in bygone days add to the atmosphere. There is also outdoor seating which would be pleasant as the restaurant is situated in a side street but yet it is close to the centre of Biarritz.  We had the set lunch menu which was incredibly good value. The choices were really good, unlike a lot of French restaurants which offer only a basic set menu at a higher cost. Each course was really delicious.  We will certainly visit La Goulue again on our next trip to Biarritz and would definitely recommend it."

La Goulue,40,Good place for dinner,"We had a wonderful meal here. The menue was a very good deal, and the tastes were quite suprising in several of the dishes.  The salmon tartar was seasoned with a red pepper sauce, which made it heavenly. The fois gras good as usual. The risotto with wild shrimps had a wonderful seafood sauce.  Service friendly and profesional."

La Goulue,20,Nothing exciting,After reading the reviews here we were expecting something really good. In reality the service was poor (we had to wait toooo long) and the food was average: it was eatable but not more than that

La Goulue,50,Wonderful place👌,"Loved everything we ate, very warm and inviting. Highly recommend it! The entrecote was delicious and really good wine."

La Goulue,50,Excellent & creative cuisine with a good fixed price menu,"I'm not sure what all the recent complaints are about here- we live in Europe and visit France several times a year. We were utterly surprised by the creativity of this place.    The fixed-price menu is noticeably cheaper than the rest of Biarritz.    We both ordered off the fixed-price; I had the langostine soup, which was excellent and reminded me of boullabaisse in Marseille. I had the duck for my main entree, and it was perfectly cooked, and came with an egg-vegetable souffle I've never seen before. But it was dessert that was the highlight: I ordered the creme brulee, which was a reimagined version. You get a frangipane (almond) crust with a frozen disc of ""creme brulee"", covered with vanilla whipped cream. It's delicious and the highlight of this trip to France.    Service is excellent- again, not sure where the complaints are coming from here- and the place is even decorated as a proper French neighborhood bistro (red walls, Toulouse Lautrec posters). Highly recommend."

La Goulue,20,"Very disappointed, at least 45 minutes to have the starter","Some people said it was a very nice place to go  Sorry to say that :  it is a Very noisy place, the background music is too loud.  Waitress need to put some deodorant  At least 45 minutes to get the starter  You ask without roquette salad (arugula) the owner answer I am sure there is no roquette and when the dish arrived it's 80 % roquette  The food is just ok but the portion are poor  I will not come back, it's a pity because my hotel is at 5 minutes walk and I am staying there almost a month"

La Goulue,20,Dissatisfaction,"Tasteless food, for 4 of us nothing stood out. Also too much sweetness added to almost every dish: salmon tartar, risotto, not talking about dessert. Wouldn’t recommend."

La Goulue,30,Mediocre to average,"This place offers a traditional french menu which adds to the variety of tapas and other Basque restaurants in Biarritz. It is very popular with tourists which should have been a warning sign. They charged us 12 Euros for one aperol spritz (a big mistake to order a drink not listed on the menu). Food was average at best. They didn’t debone the fish entrees so you have to be careful. One we asked for bread, they brought one single piece of bread (we were 3 people). We had to ask for more. Desserts were way too sweet.  There was one server his name is Mehdi who was actually amazing. This guy worked so hard and was super responsive to all requests. At some point, the table next to us had a little accident with a spilled drink and this guy went above and beyond to help, yet the lady owner kept yelling at him. That’s really too bad.  All in all, this place is nothing special."

La Goulue,30,"So, so.. rude service!","Some plates are good, some other tasteless.. Bad attitude, not even bread bring to the table without request?? 3 courses menu at 28 Euros quite a good option. Many choices to choose .."

La Goulue,20,A dissapointment,"Was at the restaurant 7 years ago and had a great experience. Coming back to Biarritz and seeing the reviews on tripadvisor, we decided to revisit the place.    We were dissapointed! The main dishes were poorly composed. We ordered different dishes and they all came with the same sides. Lacked in taste and were dull. The desserts tasted well though, but not as good as such high scores on trip advisor!    The staff were friendly. But there were no menues in english and none of the staff members could translate. We sorted it out by asking other guests at the restaurant who helped us with the translation... witout them we’d be lost."

La Goulue,50,Off the beaten track,This restaurant is away from the tourist track with a mainly French clientele. The food is imaginative and superbly cooked and presented. The menu is simply laid out and everything is freshly prepared. The chipirones starter excellent as was the red tuna main. Good value for such a treat.

La Goulue,40,two visits this time,"Attentive and friendly service. We visited twice having been here a few years ago.  My starter was and mains were excellent, but the dessert was, perhaps, a little too much.  My wife was quite happy with her meal.  The food was decently cooked and presented. Worth two visits in one week  Recommended"

La Goulue,50,"Beautiful, cozy French restaurant",Dined here for lunch on the 13th of June. The venue is very beautiful and typical of France. It is not expensive and all the dishes we had - 6 in total were beautiful. The desserts in particular were outstanding. I would recommend very highly.

La Goulue,50,Brilliant,Dined here on 16th May. Table for 9 x male golfers at 7.30. We were first in but by 8pm it was packed and we now know why !!!! We selected from the 28€ set menu. Wide choice of starters + mains + desserts including extras from the “special selections”. The chef impressed everyone in our group with the quality of the food (and that’s no mean feat !!!). Service was excellent from start to finish and the whole experience was a highlight of our trip. Thank you all at La Goulue !!!

La Goulue,50,Excellent experience all round,"My wife and I stumbled upon La Goulou, looking for a French restaurant where most surrounding food on offer in the area appeared to be anything but. We arrived too early but were advised to return at 7.30 when it opened. We returned after 8 but were squeezed in to a table even though it was very busy. We went for mains and desserts with a half-bottle of Bordeaux. Duck and Turbot both presented stylishly and beautiful, subtle flavours. Wine was superb and reasonably priced. Took a while to get desserts but the place was very busy with celebratory dinners and obviously special dinner dates for some. Salted caramel flavours exquisite. The whole experience was delightful. Best meal evening in France so far this trip and that counts Paris and Bordeaux. Staff worked together symphonically and treated us very well, despite our appalling Australian French accents."

La Goulue,50,"Beautiful, cosy restaurant perfect for lunch or dinner","The restaurant was literally 20m from our hotel. It came recommended by a local friend, so we were really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, they were fully booked on the saturday evening, so we were really happy when we managed to get a table for Sunday lunch. Vibrant, cosy, beautiful decor, packed with local families and really lovely staff. The white wine selection was lovely, whilst the food was just exquisite. The soup with grilled prawns was to die for, whilst both the duck with the cherry sauce and fresh fish with pistou were both incredible. My only constructive advise would be the wait time between sitting down and the waitress taking our drinks and food order. It was though packed, so we totally understood."

La Goulue,40,First night dinner,"An excellent local restaurant up a small side street opposite the Ocean aparthotel. The fois gras appetiser was plentiful, followed by a nice entrecôte with an iced creme brûlée to finish. The chef adjusted our dishes as my wife has to have gluten free.    A nice wine selection, not over priced, Kia Royal and Sancerre, with complementary digestives to finish.    The staff Marie and Christina were very welcoming and looked after us well. Thank you ladies.    €110 for a good dinner for two in a nice cosy restaurant, you should not be disappointed."

La Goulue,30,Last night on Praslin,"We waited until the last night of a 2 week stay to eat at La Goulue and the food was not a disappointment.  Plentiful with a fair range on the menu although the Fruit Bat Curry was unavailable on the night we went.  We were a party of four and opted for the chicken curry which was the best we have tasted on Praslin. Good value for money but perhaps it was the night we went (Tuesday), we waited 40 minutes to be served a first drink!  The restaurant looked busy and the waitresses run off their feet. I would strongly suggest more staff are needed or you need a great deal of patience!  I'm glad we sat it out because the quality of the food was worth it.  Would I return - yes but only if the service was more efficient."

La Goulue,40,Book it you will need to,"Went with a group of golfing mates , our second tour to Biarritz.  Location and outlook is not the best if you are worried about that sort of thing so it a 4 star.    Very French and very nice too. I had the squid starter; it was excellent, soft squid great dressing on crunchy leaves and with a drop of white a delight.    Duck cooked pink and a vibrant fresh raspberry sauce, sharp and fruity, was a top choice and a nice counter to the growing culture of steak based meals in town.    Given I had walked a golf course I took the plunge and had the chocolate fondant. This transpired to be a stroke of good fortune. Crisp outside, melting middle and proper chocolate too!    Happy days    Some French will help, so will a translator on the phone.  Service was fun and engaging but equally as frantic.    Good place, book it busy and rightly so."

La Goulue,50,Plat de jour,"We enjoyed Poisson a la plancha as lunch today, and it was a journey of tastes and colour. The service was excellent and warm, and I would love to visit this restaurant soon again. One of the very best restaurants in Biarritz."

La Goulue,50,"Beautiful food ,quick service great price","Four courses of quality food for 28 euros, the squid is the best I have tasted, from Busselton to Da Nang I have never had it melt in my mouth, the gambas were good & dessert was excellent"

La Goulue,40,Nice food long wait...,It's a nice cafe but get ready for a LONG wait especially if you don't speak French((( and menu is in French only so we took our chances...We had nice fish and shrimps and fantastic desert!. Our waiter stumbled while carrying our plates and one of them fell into another. He didn't even wiped the plate!...and didn't apologize and didn't say it's free you get the picture. One course of meal + desert took them 1.5 to serve!!!! so go there prepared. I would rate them 2 out of 5 for service and attitude but the food was really good so I gave them 4 for the nice chief. But attitude is haughty...

La Goulue,50,Amazing breath taking French Cuisine,"This was the highlight of our vacation. Superb French cuisine. Menu for 28€ with large choices of fresh salads, fish and meat, luxury desert. Better make a reservation."

La Goulue,10,Bad food and bad service,Goat cheese salad for a desert?! Salmon tartare - was tasteless. We got the same side dish for meat and fish. Very strange and disappointing experience

La Goulue,20,Good food - bad attitude,"Really good food, but as good as the food is, as bad is the service. Once we were so surprised by their attitude upon our arrival we decided to eat somewhere else even though we had made a reservation at La Goulue and were not sure where else we would get a table. Such a shame since the food is really nice at La Goulue."

La Goulue,40,Lovely restaurant,Great food and good selection from the set menu. Service excellent and reasonable prices. Well worth visiting.

La Goulue,50,Quite fabulous,"Everything was delicious and we had very friendly, attentive service in this small, charming restaurant a short walk from our beachside hotel."

La Goulue,30,Indifferent service and food,"We arrived at 19:25 and asked when they opened to the staff having a fag outside. In 5 minutes they said. So we waited. After 5 minutes they got up and went in, leaving us alone with no mention of them opening. We followed and were treated to studied Gallic indifference. Food nothing more than average."

La Goulue,50,Wow!,This was great!  A smaller quiter place with tables outside on the sidewalk. But what food! Big portions and really tasteful. A very Nice lady and the others in the staff really takets good care of you. We had fish and entrecote and that was the best meal under the Biarritz-visit.

La Goulue,40,Great ambience and good value,"Welcoming staff and good choice of fish and meat from the three course 28 Euro menu. Several 'specials' that add to this menu and are in the same price. Fish and shellfish is generally excellent. Ambience is enjoyable with Toulouse Lautrec prints, photos from that era and a terrace for warm evenings. We would definitely recommend this restaurant and recommend booking in advance as it is very popular."

La Goulue,30,Decent food at reasonable prices,Service was hit and miss. Young couple at nearby table left after waiting too long for service. Food generally good. Sole was overcooked. Decent wine list.

La Goulue,50,Honest and delightful French cuisine,I had a dinner with fish fresh from the market and I really enjoyed it! Service was excellent and food was a real pleasure.

La Goulue,50,"Lovely food, average service.","I believe this to be a family business (but I am not certain). There's a few comments on here regarding the service, and while it was friendly, it was a little slow. There were 3 waitresses, one of which I believe to be the owner. It seemed like she wanted to do everything, leaving the other two carrying food and drinks. If she used them better, I believe the operation would be smoother.    Anyway, aside of the slow-ish service, we had a lovely meal. It is a set price, with a surprise amuse bouche. All fresh, local products. The prawn risotto was cooked perfectly with 5 large prawns, and a risotto that wasn't too sticky. The foie gras starter was nice, but the duck and sweet potato was particularly good.    The fondant and cafe gourmand desserts rounded the meal off nicely.    So if you can bear waiting a few extra minutes for your drinks, then you'll be fine with this restaurant."

La Goulue,40,Traditional French cuisine,"La Goulue was close to where we were staying and always full, so we decided to have dinner there. Staff were great and the food was lovely. We were servedpre dinner treats which we really enjoyed. Entrees next - lovely. Our mail meals were good but two of them had just a bit too much mixture of flavours. Hoped to try this restaurant on another night but ran out of days. Next visit to Biarritz will go to La Goulou again."

La Goulue,40,Good,"It's a good place, i take a good tataki and a Great parrilla, fish was very good and waiters fine People, maybe too much expensive but it's normal in high season in a touristic place"

La Goulue,20,Very slow service,Despite reserving a table for 2 the service was very slow. Starters arrived fairly quickly but had to wait 30+ minutes for main courses. However the sole was good but rissotto was very mushy. All in all a frustrating experience when it could and should have been much better.

La Goulue,10,Nop,We thought we were lucky in having a table but noticed that the table was available because it was tooooo hot at that corner...  Slow and not friendly staff - apart for a lady with short hair who arranged the table.  What to say about a restaurant that brings the same side others for the three different meals we ordered? NOP!  The framboise sauce at the duck was too much.

La Goulue,50,Perfect Sole,Amazing sangria!! Sole was perfectly cooked -- really nicely done! Apricots and cream or Gourmand desert were both outstanding! Will return!!!

La Goulue,50,Lovely place to eat or to have a drink...served me a drink late one night even though they were closing...very friendly,Lovely place..clean..efficient staff and great quality food...located very centrally with outside and inside tables available...would recommend a visit for breakfast or evening meal...a quiet drink later on or all of the aforementioned...top class experience and we visited many times during our stay

La Goulue,40,Good quality for the money,"Well cooked fresh fish for 17,50 euro is well worth it. The place is popular so could be a good idea to book in advance."

La Goulue,40,Atmospheric Paris Style Bistro,"We have eaten here regularly over he past 15 years. Consistently excellent food, well presented, with welcoming very pleasant staff. Their fish dishes are always fresh from the local markets and the steak is also great. A comprehensive wine list for a variety of pockets! Highly recommended."

La Goulue,50,Fabulous,Small stumbled upon restaurant and we had some fabulous food. Highly recommended for lunch as the formule du midi is very good value.

La Grenouille,50,PERFECTION. old world elegance,"La Grenouile is the best restaurant in nyc.... .... ... the food is very classic French and the service is white glove to perfection.....  It is like walking into heaven. ..the lighting is the softest pinkish hue.... and of course.. the flowers are the most beautiful of any restaurant in the world....move over Paris....    'En famille', would best describe La Grenouille....The staff is formal, but friendly...move over Paris..  to  It is definitely a restaurant.... to dine... to fall in love, and to celebrate Life."

La Grenouille,40,Anniversary Dinner,"This is a place for special occasions. The service and responsiveness of all personnel from the moment we entered the restaurant was impeccable. The ambiance was very nice, with beautiful artwork and flowers. The food was very good. The captain and waiters were superb. Pricey, but very nice."

La Grenouille,30,Going downhill,"This classic French restaurant used to be on of our very favorites. The premises are still gorgeous and the cocktails were very good but, our meal and the service, was not top level. We will not be rushing back."

La Grenouille,50,One of the best restaurants ever!,"Going here was such a special treat. We were welcomed like we were their best customers and experienced exquisite food and service. The atmosphere is lovely. They are known for their beautiful flower bouquets at each table and all over the restaurant. The food was absolutely superb. We enjoyed the evening so much that we canceled our reservation for the next night and came back! Then we were treated even more like their best customers! It felt like the whole staff was glad to see us. All in all, one of life's memorable experiences. The price is not for the faint of heart, however. Including a bottle of wine, our bills were over $400. each."

La Grenouille,50,Always excellent,"We have come to Le Grenouille the last three times we have come to Manhattan and they never have disappointed us in any way. They are expensive, of course, but the impeccable service, the food done perfectly, the ambiance are all worth that one night in town when one splurges. My wife’s duck was perfect and my soft shelled crab had the best texture of shell I have ever had. They freely admit that they had a rough patch coming out of the COVID era and into last summer, but for us, they have come all the way back."

La Grenouille,30,$$$$$$,"Not for the faint of wallet. We made a reservation based on the menu seen earlier in the day. Our plan for a late night dinner was expecting two light meals plus a souffle and wine. Surprise! there are 3 menus, early bird which allows choice, a very late dinner and the one we were stuck with, price fixe. The service, ambience, music and atmosphere were top notch, however our simple plan became a moment to remember. Our out the door cost was over $500 which included tip for 2 glasses of fine wine, lovely split pea cup of soup, excellent sole, lamb and the soufflé. This was, by far, the most expensive meal for two in our lives and we are high end int'l travelers. It will be a talking point and warning to others, a momentous experience and one time visit to this storied, non michelin star restaurant."

La Grenouille,10,Just no,"Except for beautiful flowers this place is weird. Prix fix menu for 3 was over $600.00. Food was mediocre . My 80 year old father who was wearing a dress shirt and a cashmere sweater was promptly given a dinner jacket, no big deal, but we expected the food to live up to the price. None of us finished our food. Icing on the cake was when the owner took the microphone and sang weird songs. The band was lovely but he and the food were not. Never again."

La Grenouille,10,They can't possibly have a Michelin star anymore.,"We visited this past June and we were charmed by this anachronism. In June we tourists were merely seated at the worst table in the house, the food was good. Last night we were served what purported to be Sauvignon Blanc, but in an iced and sweating glass, followed by a a virtually undressed lobster salad, un-sauced and overcooked scallop first course, and burnt and overcooked foie gras and our main course.  These ridiculous snobs don't deserve your money."

La Grenouille,10,INCREDIBLY rude and disrespectful!,"We ad reservation at Le Grenouille for my 60th Nov 2020 which was on my bucket list, obviously it was canceled. Rescheduled 2021 they called a week before and said you MUST pay in advance AND get price fixed menu since holiday time. They were SO rude basically told me too bad if l won't eat all the choices. If we're paying a car payment basically for dinner l WOULD like to eat it silly me lol! We re-booked for July 30th for our anniversary instead since they said policy is different in the summer. I made it on the phone June 8th not Open Table and spoke to him in length. We drive all the way there ( we live on LI)all dressed up and... THEY WERE CLOSED FOR ""THEIR ANNUAL SUMMER VACATION""! l was SO mad, why did he take the reservation? I emailed them the next day in case they checked it. No response. They reopened last week and l asked to speak to the manager and he asked why and wouldn't put me through.l told Phillipe who answered the phone the story and he was was SO rude and said he'll look for my email. I inquired doesn't he want to KNOW my email address? You know what THAT means. No apology,NOTHING said he'll see who made the reservation, get back to me and rushed me off the phone. I never heard back. I called back today and spoke with Phillipe again. He said he didn't see my email( which l politely said I'd resend) and bascially made it that l was lieing about making the reservation since they always close for the summer.Why would l do such a thing and ruin our anniversary? I always allow a restaurant to right a wrong before writing a bad review and give them the opportunity but he couldn't care less! EXTREMELY arrogant! With SO many FABULOUS bucket list worthy places in NYC you would THINK they'd be nicer to their customers!"

La Grenouille,10,Avoid La Grenouille,"The food, ambiance and service is the worst. I come from world class historic restaurants on Wall St, I should know. There was a hooker at the bar, and my date flashed her $100 bill. I was embarrassed and wanted to leave. The waiter never asked what I wanted, only my date. My date ordered a souffle that I hate. I do not like warm desserts and no one ever asked me what I wanted, like BACS staff."

La Grenouille,50,Elegant French Dining,"My husband and I treated ourselves to La Grenouille while visiting NYC. We arrived a few minutes early and were welcomed with champagne and a small table near the bar until our table was ready. The atmosphere is elegant with fresh flowers throughout the restaurant. As a vegetarian, I ordered split pea soup and a cheese soufflé which were both outstanding. They do provide bread and mini cheese puffs as appetizers which tasted very similar to my soufflé - knowing this I may have ordered the mushroom truffle soufflé instead but still thoroughly enjoyed every bite. My husband ordered Artichoke Heart Carpaccio with Poached Quail Eggs & Truffle Oil as an appetizer and Classic Sole with Dijon Hollandaise and verts as his entree which he said was one of the best meals he’s ever eaten. Our table was right in front of the jazz band and we were blown away by the vocalist from Paris who was outstanding. For dessert, we shared creme brûlée. It was expensive meal, however for the outstanding service, atmosphere, entertainment and food, we felt it was well worth it!"

La Grenouille,40,Nice to be back!,We were so pleased to be back a t La Grenouille. The place is still as charming and elegant as ever. Having just been to Paris I see what a transplant it is though it’s been around for so long. They’d added a small band and the owner provides singing which was extremely cute - kind of a lounge lizard/Sinatra vibe. Food and wine remain excellent the only misstep was the quenelle which lacked that extra extra extra extra smoothness. Looking forward to a return visit!

La Lunchonette,50,Anthony and Rui made the night!,"We had a great dinner at Los Montes. We arrived early, and because of the cold, Anthony invited us in and provided us with some drinks before dinner. We chose from the special menu, which I think is the bargain of the day - 6 appetizers for the table, wine to pair with the food, main course, dessert, coffee and a drink.  The appetizers were exceptionally well done and of a super high quality. The Cod ball fritters were by far the best: light, fluffy, and super tasty. Along with the Paté, octopus, etc. everything was excellent.  Our waiter, Rui, was unbelievably observant, friendly, and efficient. He and Anthony made a fantastic team.  We would definitely go back. In fact, I tried to make another reservation two days later, but they were booked.  Great place, fun and friendly staff, and exceptional food!"

La Lunchonette,50,Wow...Best Meal in Spain,"Honestly, believe the reviews. Everything about this place was awesome. The food, the service, the ambiance. We booked in advance and paid the required deposit. On the day of, we were seated in a lovely private table in a covered patio that had all the benefits of sitting outside with the warmth of an inside table. We started with a tomato salad with tuna - absolutely delicious and then shared the branzino and dry aged beef. We did send back the beef since it was a little more rare than our liking - the server profusely apologized and brought it back within a few minutes. This time it was perfect - wonderful char, great season and amazing taste. The fish was also spectacular. This ended up being our favorite meal in Madrid and all of Spain. It was so good we went back one more time during our 4 days in Madrid."

La Lunchonette,50,Perfect birthday dinner spot!,We came here for a friends birthday dinner and had an incredible meal. The service was top tier and incredibly attentive. The staff gave several recommendations and offer to change anything on the menu. The general manager Anthony went above and beyond to personalize our experience for the birthday and made our night. All of the food was a 10/10. I had the wagyu burger that was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion!

La Lunchonette,50,AMAZING,This restaurant was the highlight of our trip to Madrid! Anthony was amazing and personalized our experience. We came for my best friend’s birthday and it was amazing! The food was 10/10. I literally cannot stop thinking about it. I cannot say enough amazing things about this place. Must visit when in Madrid!!

La Lunchonette,50,"Delicious meal, amazing service","This was one of our favorite meals in Madrid. (And we had many wonderful meals in Madrid.) :) The atmosphere was lovely, the food was amazing, and the service was impeccable. Anthony, our main waiter, was super attentive to us, but the other waiters were always checking on us as well. For starters, we had the crispy cod fritters and the smoked sardines. Who knew sardines could be so yummy??? The Iberian pen was a delicious entree. The lemon sorbet with cava was a delicious finisher to this delightful meal. They even sent us home with a complimentary bottle of wine!"

La Lunchonette,50,Best dining experience in Madrid to date!,"We came straight from the airport. Our dinner was outstanding in every way - food, wine, service, and atmosphere. Dani and Marcos made sure our experience was perfect. They even took care of our luggage while we ate. We will definitely come back when next in Madrid."

La Lunchonette,50,Memorable birthday treat,It is very rare that a highly rated restaurant lives up to the reviews but in this case it exceeds its reputation. Attentive & efficient yet personalised & special. We enjoyed the set course menu celebrating 26yrs of this restaurant. It comes with paired wines & a cocktail making the luxury very affordable. The service provided by Manuel & Pablo was of the highest order & great teamwork. The food was utterly delicious. Cannot recommend highly enough

La Lunchonette,50,Great last dinner in Madrid,Daniel and Eloy took great care of us and made some recommendations that turned out to be wonderful. The cod croquetta was a great start. I really enjoyed the Secreto Iberico. The cheesecake was very light and creamy. They have a great wine selection. We enjoyed a Rioja. The service by Eloy was fabulous.

La Lunchonette,50,Fabulous food and service!,"Mario was charming, helpful and an overall outstanding waiter! David (the owner's son) was also very attentive and friendly. Food is excellent...the ""feathers"" is a must try...juicy, tender and delicious! Will definitely go again next time we are here!"

La Lunchonette,50,An excellent restaurant where everyone should go!,"Thank you for the warm welcome and excellent service by Ricardo and Daniel, the amazing fish and excellent wine! For sure, we will come back!"

La Lunchonette,50,Not to be missed ! Fantastic restaurant,"I spent 4 days in Madrid and went to this place twice for lunch and diner ! The food, the wine list and the staff are amazing. Special thanks to Manuel and Anthony who have been so lovely with us yesterday to find us a table while we didn’t make a reservation. So would highly recommend this restaurant but make sure to make a reservation :)"

La Lunchonette,50,Amazing work group dinner,"Amazing service, fantastic food, caters for vegetarians and Mario makes the best amaretto sour I’ve ever had! We attended for a work group dinner and would highly recommend."

La Lunchonette,50,What a wonderful evening,"What a fantastic experience. Manuel and Alex were the best waiters ever, spoiling us with free appetizer and dessert on the house. So friendly. Really lovely food, excellent atmosphere and a great evening."

La Lunchonette,50,Not to be missed!,"This restaurant is a bit out of the way for typical tourists but we’ll worth the effort. The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. We loved our waiter, Mario, who when out of his way to be helpful. Be sure to get the surprisingly light and delicious house made pate and the pork. We also loved the burger. Good thing we walked back to the hotel since we ate so much. All delicious. Plus a great atmosphere. Not to be missed."

La Lunchonette,50,Excellent,"Escolhemos o restaurante pelo Tripadvisor. Acertamos! Local com ambiente sensacional, o staff de primeira linha. Gostaria de ressaltar um deles que é Eloy, um brasileiro que faz um trabalho sensacional. Pratos excelentes e variedades de bebidas. vindo a Madri não deixe de passar neste de restaurante.    We discovered the restaurant on Tripadvisor. We got it right! Fantastic atmosphere, excellent service. I'd like to point out one of them, Eloy's service, a Brazilian who does an outstanding job. Delicious foods and drinks. If you visit Madrid, make sure to stop by this eatery."

La Lunchonette,50,Madrid Birthday,"Delicious octopus, anchovies and sardines. The espresso martini was in my top 5. Complimentary dessert and wine as well. 10/10 recommend"

La Lunchonette,50,Wonderful restaurant in Madrid,"This is our first time visiting Madrid and I think we are so lucky to run into this restaurant because of its not very central location. Their food, hospitality and service are high class, it’s better than a lot of restaurants I have been to. Our waiter Eloy is so wonderful. We have a little problem communicating because of language barrier in ordering, but he is so patient, polite and helpful. The food we got were so good and delicious. The chef did a wonderful job in cooking and preparing our dishes. Services Eloy provided were first class. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is coming to visit Madrid."

La Lunchonette,50,Diamant in Madrid,"Nice place.  Very good food (we took the Russian salad, the scallops sashimi, the red tuna tartare and the wagyu burger) and wine.  We've got one piece of cheesecake and two lemon sorbets with cava for free.  Friendly and helpful service by Alex & Eley!!  Thanks for the gift (bottle of white wine)."

La Mirabelle,20,Gone down! So sad!,"Ever since I was at university (1975-1981) we have been irregular guests at the Mirabelle. It used to be a treat to dine there. This time we were very disappointed by our meal. The food quality has gone down, service was rude and slow. Prices have rocketed too. The fish was overcooked, the brochettes were anything but tender. Even the coffee tasted of dishwasher. So sad that this magical place lost so much of it’s quality. I am not tempted to call again."

La Mirabelle,10,"Long service, very expensive and poor quality","Very expensive and poor food (taste and quantity). As starters, I took the mozzarella di Buffala (the mixed tomato did not taste good thankfully I got an entire mozarella!). My husband had ""croquettes de crevettes"", they were big but no tasty (very chewy). We also has been disapointed by the main courses (tuna and steak). The service was very long and the bill ... OMG +100 euros for 2. We will never come back."

La Mirabelle,30,"Terrible attitude, average food","The food there is hit or miss.  -vol au vent : great  -iberico pork, profiteroles, calamaris : average to bad    Service is ok    Atmosphere is good    The owner/manager (older guy at the entrance) almost made us turn around by welcoming us like as if we were not desired there. He had such a disgusting attitude.    Will not come back. Don’t deserve your money."

La Mirabelle,40,Buzzing brasserie in 'cool neighbourhood',"The Cimitiere d'Ixelles area is now second coolest neighbourhood in Europe (see Guardian newspaper UK) so it was good to go back to the Mirabelle after a long absence. We had the basic menu choices stoemp, pain de viande etc. accompanied by the house red. Not outstanding but good and good value for money. Service unhurried but fine for us in a small group. All in all a good experience."

La Mirabelle,20,Côté à l'os without os,"We ordered a steak with bone, 1300gr in total, medium cooked.  They brought two plates with some pieces of the steak, no bone, no medium cooked. No fries, no salad. Angry and impolite staff.  We paid more than 40€/person for smt we didn't order. Two stars is a generous review."

La Mirabelle,20,Disappointed several times,"This restaurant used to be one of our regulars when we were students, some years ago. We went there again several times in the past months, and in all cases, the quality was not better than average. Very disappointing."

La Mirabelle,10,Extremely disappointing,"Don’t be fooled by the pictures of the food on the website. This is at best, a mediocre restaurant. The service was appalling. None of the drinks/courses we ordered arrived together and in each case we had to remind the waiters to bring the missing element. My pork ranged between over cooked and raw and had to be sent back. No apology received. We had to give up on the coffees we ordered which never came. When I asked for the bill after another wait I had to go to the till myself and was then presented with an amount but no breakdown which I had to ask for! Never an apology for any of the failings. Chips were very good!!!"

La Mirabelle,30,Nice terrace,La Mirabelle proposes classic brasserie dishes. Food is just OK. My Américain Préparé was disappointing ; basic seasoning and too much mayonaise. The accompanying fries were overfried. My friend enjoyeds their meal. We had a great time on the nice terrace in the sun. Service was good.

La Mirabelle,40,Very good address in a student quarter,"La Mirabelle is located in a life quarter, not so far from the university.  The place is very nice, with possibility to lunch in the nice garden or in a veranda.  We were there on a Sunday noon. I took the meunière-style sole and as dessert the sabayon. Both were very tasty.  The price was really correct: we paid for three people (main course, dessert, wine, aperitif and coffee) around 130€.  The staff was efficient. We have never waited for our dishes."

La Mirabelle,10,average at best,1) due to miscommunication between staff ( even though we have had confirmation email) of our reservation we arrived and told we had been moved into the corner right by the barista. Extremely disappointing with the loud noise by the bar.  2) Food is OK but after this experience I cannot see my returning.

La Mirabelle,30,Slow service,"We arrived at 8.30 pm and after 10 minutes nobody gave us the menu, and the waiter lost our order. After almost another hour they brought our food. But it was very good and tastefull and the location is very nice."

La Mirabelle,30,Lunch at La Mirabelle,"Kind staff and good food for a decent price, though I haven’t seen students in there (which is a price “barometer” in an area frequented by students, close to the Free University of Brussels). For lunchtime it is recommended to book a table upfront, as at noon it becomes increasingly crowd from a minute to another."

La Mirabelle,20,What has happened to the Mirabelle,"We have been going to the Mirabelle for a number of years and the quality has always been reliable. Sadly, I have to say the last two times the food was inedible.    The first time I had one of the specials, which was so salty I had to send it back. They ""very kindly"" didn't charge me for the dish I sent back uneaten, but did for the replacement dish. They apologised but that was it.    Even worse, on the second occasion I opted for steak as the safe option and it was by far and away the worst steak I have eaten in years - the quality of the meat was poor, lots of gristle - and it was cold.    Even the vinaigrette on the salad was bad. I am not sure what they had done to it, it was not the same as the dressing on my companion's salad, which was nice.    I won't be going again any time soon."

La Mirabelle,20,off putting,"Went to the Mirabelle tonight with a friend. We go there often and, despite the fact that it has been going downhill for some time now, usually enjoy our meal and the atmosphere. Tonight's first course, the asparagus, was excellent as was the fish course. The dessert, however, was disgusting and almost spoiled the whole evening though not quite. What did spoil the whole experience, having complained that the dessert was just not up to scratch, was being told by a very young waiter that these were ""real"" crêpes suzettes though perhaps ""not as I would have liked them""... effectively telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about. I was there in the sixties and as a former waiter myself I know what crêpes suzettes should taste like and tonight's offering wasn't even a semblance of that. I find this to be quite objectionable. I understand that they cannot be up to the standard of Claridge's in London or The Meurice in Paris but to react in this way is simply unacceptable. There are plenty of brasseries in the capital...go elsewhere."

La Mirabelle,50,Bravo,La Mirabelle is a pearl amongst the very modest quality restaurants in the cimitiere area of Elsene Brussels. Excellent quality and fresh including the mayonnaise 😁. Service friendly and efficient. The ristretto cafe is as it should be. There is also a delightful garden tugged away for the connaiseurs.

La Mirabelle,40,"4,5 stars",Nice restaurant! The team is great always kind! They try to bring the meals to everyone at the table at the same time. I could reorder 90% of the meals I tried! To visit !

La Mirabelle,40,A classic,"This is a typical Belgian brasserie, a bit packed and noisy, but you can find all the traditional local specialties. One of the few places I know able to accomodate large groups and still maintain a service."

La Mirabelle,50,Worth 2 visits in 1 week,"A nice romantic dinner with a friend. Pleasant atmosphere, good food and good service. Located in a vibrant neighborhood."

La Mirabelle,30,bad service,"Bustling waiters, food is ok but not more. They forgot my beer 2 times.., no excuse. Long waiting for the dessert."

La Mirabelle,50,A favorite in Brussels,"A pleasant place for a nice meal with friends. A great, reasonably priced menu. I was very pleased with the Lamb Stew and the Spaghetti Bolognaise."

La Mirabelle,40,excellent price/quality balance,"Traditional, nice, professional, good belgian food, low price. A place to go for testing Brussels Brasserie, like the Paris one but less expansive, less snobish and better food."

La Mirabelle,30,Nice atmosphere,"Looking for a place that allows children and is cozy, we ended in this restaurant in the Cimitière d'Ixelles area. Good Belgian dishes and friendly staff."

La Mirabelle,50,Superb!,"We had such a great time! The staff was very friendly with great service and recommendations, quite untypical for Brussels. The atmosphere was really good and welcoming, and great great great food! I would definitely come back and recommend to anyone."

La Mirabelle,40,Eat good and late in a very nice neighborhood,"The neighborhood of cimetiere d'ixelles is really nice and this restaurant is one of the best one between all the Asian restaurants and ""brasseries"". You have a big choice of dishes; I personally really like the pop-up burgers: three different kinds of tasty burgers!"

La Mirabelle,40,A sure thing,"I went back to La Mirabelle last week, and was again very happy with the friendly service, food quality and value-for-money. This remains one of my favorite place to enjoy Belgian specialities."

La Mirabelle,30,Nice,It's a nice place (with a nice view during the day). Staff very friendly. The food is not amazing but good. Nice to try Belgium 's specialtys

La Mirabelle,20,quite disappointing,"What can you do wrong in a Brasserie? More than you think. No doubt the stuff is super friendly! Other than that, price, quality and atmosphere of the brasserie is not given."

La Mirabelle,40,Good food and ambiance,"Superkind staff, cute ambiance (you could easily be in a Paris bistrot), great choice of meat, especially the lamb. Wine is overpriced.lamb"

La Mirabelle,40,nice place to meet friends,"nice rest. with very good service, busy environment but this does not influence the quality, good balance price/service.quality food"

La Mirabelle,50,Excellent,"This is an excellent place to go for lunch. The food is tasteful and nicely presented. The staff knows what they are doing, are friendly & helpful. The ambience of the restaurant is good, summer or winter. In short, well worth the visit."

La Mirabelle,40,One of my favourite restaurants in Brussels,"A favourite of mine and on a celebratory evening did not fail to live up to expectations. Excellent Belgian cuisine, perfect steak and chips, good wine choice, faultless staff, lovely admosphere. A must."

La Mirabelle,40,Mirabelle,"If you would like a good and typic Brussels brasserie, this is the place. Ask for the 'stump sausages' and request that it should not be overcooked. A very sympathetic service. Charlotte is the queen of the place."

La Mirabelle,50,tasty & innovative,"enjoyed a lovely supper with friends, we each chose different dishes, my meatloaf was excellent, my friends all enjoyed their steaks and américain. Nice wines."

La Petite Auberge,30,Mediocre food,"Checked out La Petite Auberge in old town Rouen. Like many spots in the area, the seating is tight, but that's part of the charm. They're serving up traditional French food – decent stuff, though nothing that'll knock your socks off. The prices were reasonable for the location. It's a solid spot for a quick bite if you're around, but nothing more."

La Petite Auberge,10,Appalling avoid like the plague,"We were obliged to attempt to eat here because we were in a pre booked group. They refused to serve us tap water/water for the table, effectively forcing us to buy their bottled water. I am sure this is illegal. We were unable to eat a mouthful of the slop they served. We have reported them to the tourist office as we feel they should be closed down...."

La Petite Auberge,30,Good food,"We had dinner here and it was fine. My husband and I had the crab in pastry, chicken in Normandy sauce and rice pudding with caramel sauce. The crab was like a paste. The flavor was good and the pastry was flaky. The chicken was cooked well but the sauce wasn't very interesting. The caramel was really good, the rice pudding was ok. All in all, dinner was good but not great. The presentation for all the dishes was quite nice."

La Petite Auberge,20,Poor quality unimaginative food and rushed,"Poor quality meat (entrecôte and Margret de Canard), which was unimaginatively cooked. Also felt we were rushed through the meal."

La Petite Auberge,10,Overpriced badly cooked meal.,"I wish I’d read reviews before going here. Because I am gluten free, which I did ask for when I made a reservation, they served me plain flounder with no sauce. I asked for some lemon. They could have grilled it, cooked in oil or butter or used another sauce but instead it tasted boiled and terrible. The vegetables served with it were soggy and over cooked. They made no effort. My daughter enjoyed her frogs legs and frites and my wine was fine but this definitely felt like a tourist trap. Didn’t help that the enebriated man across from us lit up a joint and no one said anything. Way too expensive for what you get. When I compare it to a similar priced meal I had in Paris where so much effort went into a beautiful, simple meal, I’m just so disappointed."

La Petite Auberge,50,Disappointing.,"Sad to say this meal was far from the best we had in Rouen. We try always to be positive but the service, other than the waitress who made an effort, was surly and unsmiling, from the men.  The menu choice was limited and disappointing when it arrived. The salad consisted of limp lettuce, some tiny bits of cauliflower , onion and three cherry tomatoes. The gravalax was dry. My husband found the meat he had was tough. And for what it was, it was over priced. The wine was good though."

La Petite Auberge,20,Think about it !,"Nice place, good wine, good music (thanks to the close bar/restaurant).... but worse food, not nice service and very expensive bill !!! Think about !"

La Petite Auberge,30,Not a good steak !,"This is an attractive, well located restaurant near the centre of Rouen.    It was the first day of our holiday, thus we just wanted a simple meal - I picked a simple steak (requested medium/rare) - it wasn't, it was (very) well done, as were the fries. To be fair, my partners gravlax was excellent. Maybe I should have sent the steak back, maybe you shouldn't expect a small French restaurant to produce a decent steak, maybe you should order ""more typical"" French food (as would normally), but all of these mean we don't really rate/recommend this restaurant.    The place was busy, with friendly/helpful staff"

La Petite Auberge,40,"Great location, cute terrace, attentive service.","On a busy Sunday market day we managed to nab one of the last tables here. Attentive and friendly service, and good (but not excellent) food.    We had the smoked salmon salad and chicken burger. The salad was impressive: the smoked salmon chunky, flavoursome, meaty, with heritage tomatoes, white in-season asparagus, and loads of other veg in with the leaves, along with a salmon rilette. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Normally comes with a piece of toast but as I'm GF I had the frites which were excellent.    The chicken burger wasn't the best dish - was a sort of Normandy style burger, sliced cooked chicken in an apple & cider sauce, with sliced apples and a bun. Apart from frites there was no greenery. Hubby wouldn't order it again.    Good wine and beer choices, and a cute street terrace typical of French dining. Cosy indoor dining rooms also. Worth returning to, especially on a sunny day sitting outside."

La Petite Auberge,30,Reasonable restaurant,"Busy restaurant with lots of choice and nice atmosphere, The service was friendly but felt a bit rushed. The food was of reasonable standard - filling and good value."

La Petite Auberge,30,"Small prices, but also small portions","Staff was very impatient. Came to take our order different times even when we said we needed more time. The restaurant was nearly empty, so I did not understand why they were in a hurry.  The food was ok, but nothing great. The portions were small and I wondered if everything was fresh.  The escargots were very small. Chicken and the brisket were so so. Cheese car is left there in the warm restaurant all evening.  Different from what I expected."

La Petite Auberge,10,It WAS a very good restaurant……..,It was an excellent restaurant for many years. It was sold a couple of months ago and now it has nothing good to offer….Unfortunately….Food below average and the service is bad.

La Petite Auberge,50,Excellent value.,"Had a fixed price (€22) lunch here. Starter of snails in aniseed butter, followed by pan-fried squid in a sort of fish soup, with chips. Then four cheeses. Excellent food, excellent value. There’s a wide range to choose from, including a number of Norman specialities."

La Petite Auberge,20,Disappointing visit,"We reserved a table at La Petite Auberge as it was highly recommended by local friends who have eaten here previously. We chose to eat inside and were shown to table 8. This table was the only one situated on the left hand side of the room in direct line of people passing to and from the kitchen and toilet. There was only one table occupied at the front of the restaurant when we arrived, a family of 6. A table of 3 were seated opposite and it soon became apparent that the path past our table was considerably narrowed when the most well built diner took his place. By the time cheese arrived I was ready to leave. The waitress did her best to get the cheese trolley as close as possible and seemed embarrassed that we had been put in such a poor location. It was exacerbated by the family of 6, one or more of whom seemed to need to visit the toilet every 5 minutes, particularly the eldest girl who started deliberatetely bumping our table as she passed as the evening wore on. Another couple arrived who were seated opposite us but quickly the waiter decided to move them to a better table by the wall. The food was ok but not the exceptional quality meal we hoped for."

La Petite Auberge,10,Terrible,"We have visited this restaurant many times over the years and it has always been great. Now, it is awful. Awful service. Awful food. Awful waiter. Awful management. When challenged about the meal which we had to send back, there were no apologies or offer of discount. Will definitely not return and would definitely not recommend."

La Petite Auberge,50,"Pretty little restaurant, full of character.","Cosy, characterful restaurant, we had a delicious evening meal here, lots of local dishes on the menu and some wonderful desserts. Particularly enjoyed the andouillette, a tasty pork sausage with apple. Efficient, friendly service, reasonable prices."

La Ripaille,50,A very nice place - lovely atmosphere.,We had a great relaxed meal in the courtyard. Very relaxing and lovely food and great staff. Even though they were busy the service was good and friendly.

La Ripaille,50,Last minute lunch,"We were a bit dithery this day and just made it for lunch at Le Ripaille, close to where we stayed. Even though it was late we were still made very welcome and in no way felt hurried nor 'squeezed' in. They do close around 3 normally so if like a long slow lunch don't leave it too late. Great choice for all courses with something for everyone and some imaginative cooking. Between us we had burrata, oysters and rillettes to start, then 2 x fish & chips (best crispy batter and big chunk of cod), 5 big garlicky gambas a la plancha and duck breast. No chance for pudding but I bet they're good! Attentive charming staff and big shade/sun courtyard, very central for shops galleries and Saturday market. We liked it a lot."

La Ripaille,30,So-So,"When in the old city it’s expected to be a bit tourist level. Same here. Ok to get something to eat, but not more than that. It was ok, but nothing I would recommend or return to. Avoid their cherry bomb beer (which is what you get when you ask for a “lager”)"

La Ripaille,50,Great and relaxing lunch,"What a wonderful lunch in a lovely setting. If you want to get away from the hustle-and-bustle of a busy Pezenas, make a reservation for lunch at La Ripaille in the back courtyard area. We all ordered salads and they were plenty for lunch for all of us. Glancing around at other tables we also saw some terrific-looking sandwiches and other dishes. Service was prompt for a French restaurant. Everyone was nice and polite. All of use went away happy from a relaxing lunch hour."

La Ripaille,10,Worse food ever had in France,"Apart from our waitress been lovely, this was the worse restaurant experience, never did I think it was possible to get served such awful food in France! Waste of our money"

La Ripaille,50,A hidden gem,"My wife and I were looking for somewhere to have lunch during a visit to Pezenas. Being a much frequented tourist town there are plenty of restaurants and bars in the main thoroughfares offering a Plat du jour; all very similar and fairly pricey. Whilst wandering down a side street we came across this little gem tucked away in the courtyard of an old medieval building. The Plat du Jour was a Tuna steak with the trimmings and not wanting the typical offerings from the others, decided to give it a go. The location was charming, the staff very friendly and welcoming, the service was excellent and above all our meal was faultless. A massive Tuna steak, perfectly cooked, served with a Mediterranean tomato sauce, lightly fried courgettes and a terrine of nicely flavoured Risotto rice. This came with a green salad and delicious crusty bread. I looked around at other other tables who had ordered the same and without exception the plates went back clean as a whistle. The other offerings looked equally well cooked and presented. I am notoriously hard to please and I was over the moon. All this was very modestly priced and certainly cheaper than back in the UK. Now we know of its existence we will definitely being going again. I hope they live long and prosper,; the certainly deserve to."

La Ripaille,50,Super lunch at a very reasonable price,Popped in late morning to reserve a lunch table as it was market day and the village was so busy. Arrived back an hour later and shown to the table we wanted. Food and wine was all excellent and as with other reviews the duck and fig kebab is worthy of a mention - it was superb. Lovely experience and can highly recommend.

La Ripaille,50,One of the few!,"We arrived in Pézenas on a Monday for a four-day break. We were warned by the lady greeting us in Les Gaeries de Beaulac that there wouldn’t be much open but we should find somewhere to dine.  We walked around the old town and happened upon La Ripaille. Their closing days are Tuesday and Wednesday. They have an open courtyard with kitchen one side and inside seating and a deli on the other.  Great welcome was followed by aperitifs. My wife an I then shared some four grad with a lovely muscat reduction. I had cuttlefish on the plancha and my wife the veggie suggestion even though she isn’t a vegetarian. Great food and friendly, attentive service means we will probably return on our last night on Thursday."

La Ripaille,50,Consistently great food,"128e for 6 mains, 3 pichets of wine and soft drinks. Food is consistently great here, the burger is delicious, salmon and scallops cooked perfectly and the duck & fig skewers amazing. Service with a smile and very professional. Lovely spot."

La Ripaille,50,Thats cooking,Been here many times over 6 years ' always good fab food fab wine fab design' keep up the fab teamwork chef g london .

La Ripaille,40,ANOTHER EVENING IN PEZENAS,We have passed La Ripaille a few times in the past few years but never stopped. We decided to try it out and were not disappointed. We managed to get the last table in the corridor leading to the very attractive courtyard. The menu was varied to suit all tastes and the dishes we chose were very good and reasonably priced as was the wine. The service considering how busy they were was excellent and friendly. We would return another time.

La Ripaille,50,"Great food, service and beautiful courtyard!","My husband and I went to this lovely little restaurant a couple of times during our stay in Pezanas... we loved its location off of the busy Square and our friendly waitress Rosie! The food is delicious... presented quite simply and unpretentiously as good food should be! Rosie spoke quite good English and was able to help us with our menu selections... my husband had the duck and I had the shrimp and scallops...Both were delicious!  I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant ...especially for those of you who like a little, friendly spot away from the crowd!!"

La Ripaille,40,Very nice!,Pezenas seems to have many nice restaurants from walking around the beautiful old city. La Ripaille stood out for its inauspicious outdoor courtyard and nice menu.    We had lunch here and the food was lovely. We had the Roquefort salad and the scallops. Both dishes were perfect for lunch.    Service was very friendly. The lady serving us spoke good English and brought out pens and paper for our daughter to draw with. Definitely kid friendly.    Recommend for lunch.

La Ripaille,40,Lovely welcoming staff and good food,We had dinner at La Ripaille on 15th June. Extremely lovely waitress showed us to our table and we ordered salad de la mer and Roquefort salad. Delicious and good value. We also had a very nice bottle of wine - a glass of which we enjoyed with the waitress. Courtyard is lovely but it was windy which led to a bit of a wind tunnel effect. Overall very nice and well worth a visit.

La Ripaille,50,Delightful,"Passing through Pezenas and running a bit late for lunch we were lucky to find La Ripaille still open. The last of the diners left and we had the place to ourselves. Excellent service! Very good food. We shared foie gras, seiche, and a rare steak."

La Ripaille,40,Delicious lunch,"We turned up on spec and were lucky to get a table on a Sunday in their cute courtyard. Fabulous salmon tartare to start followed by boef tartare and a burger, all delicious, fries to die for, a pichet of their great house red and friendly and leisurely service all in around €55 - happy customers, we recommend."

La Ripaille,40,Lovely place in courtyard,"We had lunch in the lovely courtyard, we did not book a table in advance.  Service was lovely, they had an english menu so we could choose.  We shared a Foire Gras starter 3 people, and I'm glad we did, it was quite large.  My mom and I chose the shrimps in parsley (note that you have to pill them yourselves) and my husband chose the tartar, HUGE portion.  Nice wine. Price level was reasonable and we enjoyed our place in the yard."

Landmarc,40,Delightful,"I went to the bar at the Landmarc with a couple of friends and we had such a delightful time. It was surprisingly reasonable, for the location. Plus our server, John, was charming and totally on the spot."

Landmarc,30,Mediocre,"Place was very busy, bar staff friendly. Menu somewhat limited in choice, food cake out warm, atmosphere was good, but I think this was because it was full"

Landmarc,50,Excellent brunch,Good choices for brunch. From eggs to blts to salads and a few entrees. Bloody Mary’s excellent. Great view of Trump international hotel and an entrance to Central Park. Kid friendly.

Landmarc,40,Always there ran or shine early or late,"At Columbus Circle when you come out of a movie or a show and everything is closed ,you can count on it good food ,bread delicious and food to share"

Landmarc,40,Birthday dinner,Went here for an early dinner as we had small children with us. The wait staff were very efficient and had organized high chairs for them. I ate a steak commended by them and enjoyed it very much. The appetizers were also Delhi cious

Landmarc,40,Excellent,Recently had a very nice dinner with family and friends. Food and service were very good. The waiter recommended a drink to a friend that she didn't enjoy but readily took it back with no question. Lamb Shank was excellent. Would return for another visit.

Landmarc,50,All the Food was Excellent,I had the filet mignon. It was cooked as I asked for it and seasoned perfectly. The sauce for the mussels were so good we asked more bread for dipping. The dessert served was small pastries and all of them were good.

Landmarc,50,Always great AND great for breakfast !,Have been going to this place for quite some time but now found out that they also serve excellent breakfast! Always excellent quality and friendly staff. Great selection of half bottles. Very kids friendly.

Landmarc,40,Texas Lady visit's Landmark Restaurant,"Very trendy restaurant with excellent, eclectic food. Not an expansive menu, but many unusual items. i.e.: crispy sweetbreads, that were delicious. I do not recall if my iced tea was $5.00 or $8.00, but without being offered any refills, either way, it was expensive.  The service was subpar. There were only two other tables seated when we arrived: it was early and not busy. It took almost 10 minutes before our table was approached for a drink order.  Very slow service during dinner. We had to seek our waitress out to get our bill, and again to pay."

Landmarc,50,My favorite,"Every time we come to NYC, we make our way to Landmarc. Great atmosphere, great food. Definitely a favorite."

Landmarc,50,solid restaurant,Went with large group from work. Had almost everything on the menu... Food was very good and although we were a big group service was excellent. If its warm try to seat outside maybe noisy from the street but very pleasant. I had salad and Lamb both were good.

Landmarc,50,"Excellent food, wine, service and atmosphere","We enjoyed a great evening with friends at Landmarc. The wine list was great and we received excellent recommendations from the bar man. Our starters and main courses were also great. The desserts were delicious, but small"

Landmarc,40,Brunch on a Saturday,We went there with our 2 years old because it was listed on google search as kids friendly restaurant. It was! We had brunch outside and changed table in the middle of the meal. Staff did everything happily and brought crayons for my son to keep him occupied. Service was fast and food was good! Only thing I did not like was my drink but other than that an enjoyable experience.

Landmarc,50,"Great wine list and smashing steaks, *****","This place is superb, we've been coming here for several years and it gets better and better. The reasonably priced wine list has gone up a little but that reflects the market and the food is sensibly priced and excellent. I would seriously recommend Landmarc, in fact I have done on may occasions."

Landmarc,30,missed the mark,"you would think if you order a $45 filet they could cook it right. ordered medium well and it came rare. took almost 15 minutes to make it right by this time my wife had finished her meal. they know better,"

Landmarc,20,"Sorry, over-priced and why can't one order wine by the glass???","I live in the neighborhood and was looking for a replacement for our local French spot, Circle Rouge, which has closed. I was hoping Landmarc would fill the void, but it cannot. Circle Rouge was a legit French bistro, with classic entrees and appetizers at a decent price. Landmarc stylistically should be a neighborhood restaurant, but it is over priced and the food does not match the cost. The foie gras terrine was nice, and the chèvre profiteroles also were good, but for $13, the profiteroles were over priced. I enjoyed my Nicoise salad, but the fact that we had to order wine by the half or whole bottle nearly destroyed the experience. I like white, my husband likes red. Why can't we each get a glass of what we prefer? The fact that this restaurant only serves half or whole bottles of wine is ridiculous. I ended up ordering a whole bottle, rather than two halves, because it would have been absurdly expensive to order two half bottles. I have never seen a restaurant that does not offer wine by the glass. Stupid. Not to mention the fact that my husband's entree, the lamb chops, cost $37 but did not come with vegetables and a starch. So we had to order potatoes as a side dish. To top it off, the kitchen (or the waitress) screwed up and we had to wait before the potatoes we ordered as a side dish were delivered. This isn't a steak place, but is supposed to be a French restaurant. Who would have thought that we needed to order sides separately? Can't a $37 plate of food include vegetable and a starch? Not to mention that the lamb chops were very fatty. So, in sum, totally not impressed and will not go back. Can't believe this place has been in business since 2004."

Landmarc,20,very disappointing,"service is terrible, food mediocre, overall a very disappointing experience. they ignored us for at least 20 minutes, then we had to call them twice to get them to bring the wine we had ordered. the (white) wine finally arrived but was not cold. the food was way below average - their lamb burger was tough and not tasty at all, the fries clearly not home made, and the service unprofessional and uncaring throughout the dinner. never going back."

Landmarc,50,Rainy Day Lunch for Two,"In NY to visit with a dear friend, we arrived just in time for the business lunch crowd on a cold and rainy day with no reservation - and got a terrific table. Our waiter was outstanding - smart, articulate, professional and knowledgeable, he made wonderful food and wine recommendations. The food was outstanding - creative, seasonal, expertly prepared and absolutely delicious. From start to finish, a wonderful experience!"

Landmarc,20,Poor for the Price,"Calamari over cooked and chewy, skirt steak salad was oily and gelatinous and sweetbreads were overcooked. On the plus side, the service was good. For the price we paid, it was a very poor value meal."

Landmarc,50,Very good Burger and Steaks,"One of the best Burger and Steaks here! The steaks are very good, but you have to order the steak ""medium rare"". Then it's very delicious 👌🏻"

Le Bernardin,30,Don’t waste your money!,"Quite a bizarre experience at Le Bernadin and we were really looking forward to the evening.  I’ll start with the actual dining room. Underwhelming, large and the layout gives you the feeling that you’re in a dining hall rather than an intimate exclusive restaurant.  The food. We had the full tasting menu with wine pairing. The bread was awful. I always look forward to the bread because usually in good restaurants you get good bread. The so called baguettes could’ve been a frozen one from Lidl. In fact that would be insulting to Lidl. Extremely poor quality.  Most of the dishes excluding the mains of Fluke and Halibut were delicious pretty much a 10/10. The two main dishes however were a big fail. Seriously not good at all.  What was almost shocking about this restaurant was the service. Ok, it was like a well oiled machine. You didn’t want for anything and everyone went around their business perfectly in sync but with absolutely ZERO interaction with us. Rushed, clinical, robotic, cold and unsmiling. Totally bizarre. We had a 8-10 course dinner and we were in and out in less than two hours. We would NEVER come back here again. For 1200dollars there are a million and one other restaurants to go to for a quarter of the price and sensational service and food. Can’t believe you have 3 stars."

Le Bernardin,50,Worth the Trip.,"It had been twenty years since the last visit  Anticipation fueled my food lust and heightened  the trip to NYC leaving me eager to feel and taste.  It’s a pleasure and a satisfaction to be seated and  made ready to enjoy. The table top screams the  confidence of the house and the French cuisine does the  same. Whether it’s the stunning Caviar or perfect Fluke  the plate grabs the imagination. The table took the  menu which leaves freedom to converse and critique.  By the end of the eight plates almost every point of  light had been touched and savored. Impeccable.  There is a dryness though to service that slips into an  almost flat finale. It is hard to maintain. This however  is Le Bernardin so it’s expected. This is the restaurant  that the French hold dear and champion for all time.  My first such restaurant was La Table des Cordeliers  in Condom, Gers, France in 1976. Rarely do I get to be  reminded of that place and that time. I do by Le Bernardin."

Le Bernardin,40,Not three stars,"I was underwhelmed by the restaurant. Maybe it is the black bass I ordered, but it is just like any fish in any fine dining restaurant. I was expecting to be wowed in the three michelin star restaurant. My partner, she tasted sand in her scallop, which is unacceptable. I don't know, maybe my expectations are too high."

Le Bernardin,50,Fabulous!,"We had lunch and what a lunch! Tasting menu with wine pairings, everything flows and dances in your mouth.  From the halibut and the langoustine to the scallops and the Maine lobster, it is just divine!  Enough with the food, it is too good to describe, you need to experience it!  The service is spectacular. From the front door to the table, it is a sumptuous ballet of professional minds.  There is a reason Le Bernardin has 3 stars, it is perfect!"

Le Bernardin,50,Barbara turned a 3 star into a 4 star,We opted for Le Bernadin for my birthday. There is simply no place better with fish. Today was no exception. The food and service was outstanding.  I hesitated to write this since it seems only negative reviews are marked helpful. But I had to tell someone about our sommelier Barbara. Her contribution (and the wines) put the meal over the top. We had the 8 course tasting menu with wine. Barbara said we would each get the equivalent of a bottle of wine. She sensed this was more wine than we would want and said she could pare it back and still match it up. So we had our champagne followed by magical pairings and were still able to walk out. All 3 stars have great food. What sets them apart is the”of course you can” attitude as  exemplified by Barbara. She sensed what we wanted and made it happen.

Le Bernardin,40,A 'reluctant' Michelin 3* offering inconsistent dishes from spectecular to just so-so!,"Michelin 3 stars, New York Times 4 stars, La Liste joint #1 Restaurant in the World, San Pellegrino World’s Best 50 Restaurant List……….etc, etc.    Since its opening over 3 decades ago, continuous culinary accolades and awards had been pouring in for this New York gastronomic temple. As such, with such stellar credentials, to most of the gourmands in our party, a meal at this iconic institution has become the most anticipated foodie event of the year, if not in their young life?!    For lunch, two dining options were offered. First, a full blown USD300+, 8 course chef tasting menu that the whole table has to participate in. Alternatively, a protracted, reduced 3 course table d’hote made up the other option. Though it would be enticing to savor so many of Chef Ripert’s creations all at once, however, to Rosy, having an 8 course tasting menu so early in the day was too much of a daunting task. Consequently, the entire party settled for the reduced course alternative.    Our selected luncheon option followed a formidable and challenging format. For the first course, patrons were requested to pick a single dish from a list of nearly 20 imaginative, mouth watering and unique, ‘almost raw or barely touched‘, seafood creations. For the main course, 8 ‘lightly cooked’ seafood and fish masterpieces were offered. Man! So many selections to choose from!..talk about information overload and tough decisions making!..Maybe a nice task for ChatGPT?! Ha!    Our fun yet frustrating evaluation and selective process yielded the following first, main and dessert course options:    AMUSE BOUCHE:    Salmon Rillette; Sourdough Bread Crisp.  BREAD SERVICE:    4 Bread Samples ( Brioche, Baguette, Walnut & Raisins……plus  Normandy Butter )  FIRST COURSE:    Shellfish Medley  Uni, Razor Clams, Langoustine, Mirugai, Shrimp Custard, Smoked  Pork Dashi Broth.  Bacalao  Warm Bacalao Escabeche under a cloud of Saffron Brandade  MAIN COURSE    Dover Sole  Pan roasted Dover Sole, Green Olives, Toasted Almonds, Aged  Sherry Wine Emulsion.  Fluke  Pan seared Fluke, Twice Baked Mini Potatoes, Urchin-  Bouillabaisse Emulsion  Hiramasa  Grilled Hiramasa, Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, Bone Marrow -  Red Wine Bordelaise  DESSERT    Baba Au Whiskey - Purple Sweet Potato ‘Baba’, Caramelized  Pecan, Smoked Okinawa Sugar Ice Cream  Citrus ‘Madeleine’ - Vanilla Genoise Sponge, Lemon Mousseline,  Berry Medley  Peruvian Dark Chocolate - Warm Peruvian Chocolate Tart, Tahitian  Vanilla Ice Cream  Corn - Sweet Corn Mille-Feuille, Salted Caramel Sauce  Sorbet - Poire William  So! What is the overall verdict? Was the quality of the food superb and distinctive enough to exude the degree of greatness that commensurates with a Michelin 3* plus other preeminent ratings and accolades that were bestowed upon it?    For this, one has to evaluate and critique from the viewpoint of Chef Eric Ripert’s philosophy towards treating and preparing fish and seafood. In short, Chef Ripert loves to adopt a ‘simple’ approach to cooking fish, treating the natural ingredients with respect and letting the characteristic shine on its own. Based on this, ingredients used in each and every one of our dishes were prepared and executed flawlessly and with loving care by the talented kitchen. So, the answer is a resounding ‘Yes’!    Accompanying sauces or seasoning, where necessary, were well-balanced and care was taken not to overpower the main ingredients……. Though in some cases, may be a touch too conservative and overly cautious? These were reflected by the ‘too delicate‘ taste profile of the Seafood Medley and the underwhelming, ‘taste lacking’ Bordelaise sauce accompaniment for the Hiramasa dish. On the other hand, the Dover Sole and the Fluke were simply amazing, totally worthy as Michelin 3* offerings. I have lived and worked in Britain and France for over a decade and have had my fair share of well executed Dover Soles. However, this Le Bernardin’s rendition was heads and shoulders above the rest, both in taste, degree of doneness and texture……the best and tastiest ( western style preparation ) Dover Sole I have come across.  In this scenario, the pros canceled the cons resulting in a no-decision!    Dessert courses were one of the best and spectacular collections I have come across ( the other, Robuchon au Dome in Macau ).    Overall atmosphere in my opinion was a bit stuffy and pretentious. Front-of-house a touch dim and under-lite.    Service, though efficient, lacked smile and enthusiasm.    So, in conclusion, is Le Bernardin worthy of its Michelin 3* status? The answer is a reluctant Yes……more like 70% three stars and 30% two stars. As for the #1 rating on La Liste?! This I beg to differ, noting quite a few Michelin establishments I have frequented in Europe and the Orient ( especially Japan and Hong Kong ) offered better overall dining experiences."

Le Bernardin,50,Superb dining experience,"Yes, its elegant, yes its pricey and, yes, Le Bernadin lives up to its reputation. Excellent service and absolutely superb food. Presentation is perfection here, but quality is also key to seafood dishes that are deliciously delicate. There is a chef's tasting menu as well as an extensive a la carte--choose 4. A splendid experience."

Le Bernardin,50,Best Fine Dining Experience,"This is the only 3 star Michelin restaurant in NYC that caters to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.    Ambiance: I love the subtle decor of the restaurant. It is very elegant and refined and I love the different utensils and plate ware that the restaurant carries.    Food: My review of the food is based on the experience with the 8 course veggie tasting menu. All the dishes were delicious and unique. I don't think I've ever had vegetables cooked to such a perfect temperature and consistency. The food was plated beautifully as well. The desserts were so unique and each bite held a different taste and surprise. From the guests who joined me, they felt that all the non-vegetarian food was also delicious and exceeded expectations.    Service: The service is excellent and staff were very attentive. Everyone was very friendly from the individual who called us to offer us an earlier dinner time to the hostess and service staff.    Price: Considering the 3 star status, I would say the 8 course tasting menu was priced reasonably. I also love that they price the vegetarian tasting menu lower so that it feels fair. It's one of the few restaurants who actually does this.    Overall, one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had."

Le Bernardin,50,Sublime dining,"We had high expectations and all were met. The staff was extremely friendly and engaging throughout dinner. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings, but started with a Kir Royale and followed with caviar and chilled vodka before dinner service. We both enjoyed every dish and my husband usually dislikes fish; he raves this is the best seafood he’s ever had. I have to agree. The sauces were flawless and each fish course was perfectly prepared. We look forward to eating here again soon."

Le Bernardin,30,Worthy but not Overwhelming,"Dined with friends and family on September 18th. We had the 4-course experience. Started out with a Manhattan. It was quite disappointing as I do not believe that they keep the whisky in the freezer, thus, being able to create a perfect Manhattan made perfectly. A warm Manhattan is short of the mark. I came in with an open mind and great expectations as this is my first 3-star dining experience. The sauces that came with the fish servings were the highlight of each course. Serving size was adequate. The wines were descent but nothing special. I was hoping for the best fish meal I ever had but that did not happen. The best fish dining experiences I have ever had were in Howth Ireland (Crabby Joes) and Coeur d'Alene Idaho (Paddy's sports Bar). At least I can say I dined in a 3-Star Michelin Restuarant."

Le Bernardin,50,I loved Le Bernadin,I'm a vegetarian and tried the 4 course prix fixed. The artichoke appetizer was refreshing and had so much flavor. The mushroom pasta dish was so delicious. And the hazelnut dessert and corn ice cream was also just wonderful wonderful

Le Bernardin,50,"Perfect,...again","This was my second experience and just like the first, it was perfection. The team at Le Bernardin are incredibly consistent. Service, food, presentation, attention to detail and value were all spot on. You cannot do better than Le Bernardin for a true 3 Michelin star dining EXPERIENCE."

Le Bernardin,50,New York's best restaurant without a doubt,New York's undoubtedly #1 restaurant of all times. Do get the tasting menu and get it with wine pairing. It's a once in a lifetime experience. It's mostly based on fish and seafood.

Le Bernardin,30,Disappointed,"For this to be rated a three Michelin star restaurant it fell way short of my expectations. Above all theatrics or service or whatever involves being rated by Michelin the food simply has to taste good & for the most part this food was bland. I think the theology is that the fish should be the flavor but it could’ve used some seasoning to some dishes. Also the mere lunch will run you upwards of $200 & while I’m nowhere near cheap it angers me when I’m spend this amount of money & im not floored by the food. There are some positives such as my first course was actually tasty, possibly due to the truffle, & my mock tail was also delicious. The entrees & desserts could use some tlc though. Service was top notch but again all of this is irrelevant when the food isn’t amazing"

Le Bernardin,40,Dishes are visually stunning,"This was my second visit to Le Bernardin -- and the first visit cannot be topped since we actually saw Eric Ripert. From what I understand, he's away this month, which was a disappointment. In terms of the food, which is what really matters, most of the dishes are absolutely visually stunning. Surprisingly, the filet mignon, a non-seafood dish, was delicious. But of all the dishes, the strawberry meringue dessert actually made us gasp because it was so beautifully presented, and ended up being enjoyable to eat as well. Unfortunately the other (seafood) dishes were tasty, but not as remarkable or memorable taste-wise. The amuse-bouche was salmon salad (like tuna salad)0 on toast. It was still a positive experience, but slightly disappointing since seafood is supposed to be their strength."

Le Bernardin,40,"Very good, but not perfect","I was thinking about giving 5/5 but my wife had a few additional observations and the final conclusion is 4/5.  Le Bernardin was a wonderful experience. We're ordinary people, but not without experience from Michelin star restaurants. We don't do this all the time and therefore we're always looking for something special and exceptional. The dining room is simply beautiful. However, it's basically one big room, so not very intimate. There's naturally a lot of staff and the overall impression is a bit busy. Our table wasn't the best available, close to the entrance, which emphasized the feeling of being in the middle of traffic. On the other hand, it's NYC, so it's in the DNA of the city. Staff was very professional and made us feel comfortable. The pace of service was quite fast and we were served by a lot of different people, but again, it's NYC.  Food was excellent, of course. Nothing to complain as such. Compared with other top-end restaurants, the menu was playing safe, not too innovative or risky. For someone looking for hard core avant-garde, it was perhaps even too unsurprising, but that's more about personal preferences. Both the menu and the wine pairing were very European. I fully understand that knowing Mr. Ripert's background, but we were slightly surprised to see e.g. no Californian wines. Again, not a question of good/bad, just a personal observation.  Overall impression was very positive and the reason for not giving 5/5 is simply because the bar was set so high. Reducing one point doesn't indicate that there was something wrong, but reflects a personal view that somethings could have been different. We truly enjoyed or visit and would certainly do it again."

Le Bernardin,30,Excellent food overshadowed by the average service,"Le Bernardin, you got 3 Michelin stars. As such, I expect also that level of attention and not just cuisine. Let me start with the important part: food was amazing. Dishes were perfectly seasoned, well balanced and just right. I truly enjoyed every bite, except for the last savory dish: the halibut. Why? Because it was not a pescatarian dish. The sauce bourguignonne was a reduction of beef stock and bacon. Needless to say, I stated in the reservation that I do not eat land animals. When I pointed this out, I was told to say so when I sat down and was asked for allergies. Seriously? You are blaming this faux pas on the customer? A simple apology would have been just right. No need to redo or replace. Frankly, after having eaten at many restaurants around the globe, I was somewhat stunned by that arrogance. And while we are at it: One slice of the olive bread had a nice 3 in black hair. Can't be mine, because... drumroll... I shave my head and have no hair. While mistakes like the hair can happen, how one reacts to the customer can swiftly make the worst mistakes acceptable. Not here. I will be back, and we shall see if Eric's wonderful restaurant lives up to the name and accolades."

Le Bernardin,50,The best meal of my life,I have eaten at a lot of restaurants but never a 3 Michelin star restaurant. It was incredible.    Booking was on Resy and I was able to get a table easily.    The service was excellent. Everyone was so welcoming and professional. The sommelier was outstanding - matched every course with some excellent and interesting wines.    The menu is delicious. We did not think we could manage the tasting menu so went for 4 courses (also a challenge!). I had the tuna and foie gras which was just perfect. I often think about that course and it makes me so happy! The fluke was to die for. Absolutely perfectly cooked. The dessert was also just sublime - a hazelnut chocolate deliciousness!    It is quite pricey but it is more than worth it. Such an experience!

Le Bernardin,50,Excellent!,I had the tasting menu here at Le Bernardin a while ago and loved it. Now their 3-course lunch is also excellent. All dishes are carefully crafted and well executed with creativity while not overly expressive.  A good news is that they do offer their tasting menu for lunch as well. I will certainly be back for that.

Le Bernardin,40,Great experience,"The restaurant is kind of old looking with carpet, it doesn’t give you a feel of a luxurious place. Service was excellent. Food was extraordinary. We went on a weeknight and place was full. You have to make reservation months ahead. The presentation of food was very good. Started with amuse bouche with seafood variations and we had 4 course dinner. Also they serve amuse bouche before desert and at the end they brought a small plate of variety of chocolates. It was too much food to eat. They should also consider to serve 3 course dinner as we felt full and didn’t enjoy much the third and forth course or they should consider smaller portions for less price as it was very pricy."

Le Bernardin,50,One of THE Best Restaurants in NYC,"We always wanted to eat a Michelin starred restaurant. Go big or go home, so we went right for a 3-star. Ranked in the top 50 in the entire world. That’s pretty impressive.  The menu is prix fixe and as we were there for lunch we ate off their lunch prix fixe menu. That included two dishes and a dessert, which was a little unclear on the website. The host or maitre d were pleasant enough. Our wait staff seemed a bit annoyed, which was disappointing. The winner was our sommelier. Their wine menu is VERY overwhelming, but beautifully constructed. He learned what wine we typically enjoy and based on our menu selection recommended a unique and interesting wine we could normally not get in our neck of the woods.    Our first course, my wife had the sautéed shrimp and I had the shellfish medley. Both dishes were beautifully plated. My wife’s shrimp were the best prepared shrimp we’ve ever had. Unfortunately my shellfish medley was not that enjoyable. There were elements of it that were nice like the smoked pork dashi broth. However, there was a fishiness to it that prevented the dish from feeling completed.    Our main course, my wife had the salmon in a gazpacho consommé. Boom!!! This dish was the winner of our meal. Light, fresh, summery dish that just came together with every bite. I am not a fan of salmon, but this was so meticulously done to perfection. Wow! I ordered the striped bass with stuffed zucchini flowers. I am a sucker for stuffed zucchini flowers and this dish did not disappoint. What looked liked the flower stems were a purée of some kind that really balanced the dish out nicely between the strong mushrooms and the mild fish.    Dessert was a superb. My wife opted for the carrot cupcake and I ordered the honey dessert. Yozer wozer!! Beautiful on both counts, but even more impressively delicious.    At the end it was a pleasure to meet chef Eric Ripert. He is truly a legend in the kitchen. His restaurant is nothing short of a gastronomical art gallery."

Le Bernardin,50,Great luncheon for our 41st wedding anniversary,"We thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary lunch at Le Bernardin. Service was friendly and all our questions were answered promptly. The sommelier was helpful and added to our perfect experience. And oh, the food…..simple, fresh, amazing flavors. Anything you order will make you happy. So, thank you to the cheerful and knowledgeable staff of this famous restaurant; well deserved three Michelin stars!"

Le Bernardin,30,It May Just be Me,"In the last month, my family returned to several Michelin rated restaurants in Paris and New York. They all have suffered the same fate. The service has been impeccable, the presentation au currant and the food bland. Actually, bland is worse than bad. Bad begs to be bettered, bland just limps along. Bad is poor quality and or technique. Bland is a lack of pride, perhaps a fear of failure or maybe, as my daughter says, I just like too much salt."

Le Bernardin,50,Simply wonderful,"Without any hesitation .I can say that Le Bernadin is, by far, the best restaurant in the USA that I have dined in. I have eaten here a number of times since its opening , either on business with various size groups, or with my spouse, and it has never been less than extraordinary. Additionally, the service, at all positions is exemplary. The wine list is world class and the cocktails are excellent as well. There are even modestly priced wines by the glass on offer and the sommelier is gracious choosing and serving wines at every price category. If my memory serves me correctly, the original chef, who was the brother (now long deceased) of one of the current owners was one of the first, if not the first, to introduce fish dishes which were not overcooked or baked, as was the practice at the time. His sister, an owner, and his original co chef, now chef, have continued and perhaps surpassed, the experience.  This is fine dining at its best in beautiful surroundings."

Le Bernardin,50,Excellent experience,"My husband and I had a wonderful meal yesterday at Le Bernardin. It never disappoints. We had tuna and shrimp appetizers and salmon and merluza main course. Finished with delicious desserts. The entire staff has always been professional, helpful in describing dishes and recommending wines. Thank you to all the people that we came across, in particular Kevin who was kind, professional, knowledgeable, and friendly, making our meal a great one to remember. We will be back."

Le Bernardin,50,... best dessert in town?,"We had a lovely meal. It lives up to its name and more. I am excited to see where Chef Thomas Raquel goes from here. Big, big fan."

Le Bernardin,50,Unforgettable Night!,"My dream to visit and dine at Le Bernadin and it came true! My husband had time wrong but we were seated at the bar for a few moments, maybe 1 minute by the time our table was ready. When we stood up to go, the one and only Chef Eric Ripert was standing with his hosts. When I finally was able to speak, I asked for a photo and he was so kind and said yes! Once we sat, we were greeted by several people to discuss food, allergies, wines etc. each person with their purpose and that was to take complete care of my husband and me.  We decided on the chefs tasting menu and we were blown away. Prior to the first course, we were offered a choice of bread and I’ll tell you it was hard not to ask for them to leave the whole thing. Delicious and so fresh! The courses begin and one by one the beauty and elegance and flavor was more than we could ever imagine also, these tastings seemed like full glasses. The entire meal was so special and definitely requires a chefs kiss. Thank you for an unforgettable evening of flavor, beauty and great attention to detail."

Le Bernardin,50,Nearly sublime,"Anyone rating this restaurant as anything other than superb in comparison to almost any other restaurant in Manhattan has either a chip on their shoulder or is culinarily ignorant. That said, Le Bernardin is not culinarily superb when it comes to imparting a feeling that the diner is gettiing a dining experience that is unique to that diner. For that, I remember a tasting menu long ago at NOBU. Never again at any restaurant I have felt that personally pampered. I guess, though, if I want that I should hire my own personal chef. In the meantime, Le Bernardin will suffice."

Le Bernardin,50,"Still classic, ageless, timeless","I am a bit of a tasting menu junkie, and have had my share over the years both domestic and internationally. If I had to choose just one, it would be Le Bernardin, which has remained classic, ageless and timeless for over 35 years, with Eric Ripert at the helm for nearly the entire time. Reservations remain a challenge to secure. They are released one month ahead beginning at 7 am ET the first of each month, so for me that was 4 am PT. Of course, Le Bernardin remains a seafood-centric restaurant, with beef or fowl served only ""upon request"".    For dinner, Le Bernardin offers a Chef's Tasting Menu of 8 courses for $298 (with an optional wine pairing available) or a Prix Fixe 4-course menu for $198, with several choices for each course. Lunch is a 3-course Prix Fixe for $120. Post-pandemic, the restaurant no longer requires jackets for gentlemen, but many diners still wear them, as did I.    I of course opted for the Chef's Tasting Menu. When I came last year, I believe there were 2 tasting menus; one was seasonal, the other was Le Bernardin ""classics"". I went with the classic one then, which was outstanding. This time there was just the seasonal menu, but it was equally memorable. The meal included: tuna-sea urchin toast, scallop with caviar, poached lobster, sautéed langoustine, pan-roasted dover sole, steamed halibut. poached rhubarb and pistachio praline. Interestingly, the tuna-sea urchin and halibut had beef-based sauces. The bread basket was delicious as usual, with 4 all-you-can-eat choices (brioche, baguette, raisin-walnut and rosemary olive).    Service was of course excellent. Another fine meal to cap off my weeklong NYC visit."

Le Bernardin,50,wonderful,"always been magnificent, and you have Maguy and Eric. You also have the wonderul ocean spray painting on the wall, and great wines, including Gruner Veltliner from Austria"

Le Bernardin,50,This restaurant sets the bar high,Our multigenerational graduation celebration was perfect from the amuse bouche through our generous four courses to the petit fours that followed dessert. Impeccable service without being unctuous or overbearing. Each dish was tastier than the previous one.

Le Bernardin,50,Every Dish is a Star,"Even if this restaurant had no Michelin stars (which it does-3 to be exact) every dish I had for dinner was a star all by itself. And dish after dish, my expression was the same, “Wow!”  But good food is not the only star performer here. The service staff that served our meal was friendly, knowledgeable, made great wine and beverage suggestions and generally just made the whole experience that much better.    Will I go back…DEFINITELY! It as good as dining gets anywhere in the world."

Le Bernardin,50,Wonderful,"We adored the vegetable tasting menu with paired wines. We were seated near the window, looking out into the room (no looking into walls), loved everything we were served, enjoyed the waitstaff and just thought the whole experience was delightful. Next time we're in NYC we'll go back."

Le Bernardin,50,A very good experience,"It was my first time to have lunch at this restaurant, which is located in the heart of Manhattan. As soon as you arrive, you can feel you are in a different place, with the elegant and sophisticated decor, Chef Eric Ripert walking around the restaurant to make sure the service and food is up to standard, and the whole team is very dedicated to making sure you have the best time!"

Le Bernardin,50,What a difference Cary made for our dinner at Le Bernardin!!,"We were here for a previously-cancelled anniversary dinner (Covid.) Couldn't get a dinner reservation, but luckily scored two seats at the lounge bar. Our bartender/server was incredible. Cary was so welcoming, so thoughtful, and so engaging; he made our night. The food was as delicious as expected, but the experience was, thanks largely to Cary, spot on. Even Eric Ripert was in the lounge that night, sitting right behind us with some other guests. Great evening all around. Thank you, Cary."

Le Bernardin,50,Excellent In Every Way,"I cannot rave enough about Le Bernardin. A restaurant that touches on many senses. Beautifully plated delicious food , elegant decor and professional staff. I personally do not eat raw seafood, so I specifically go for the Excellent vegetarian tasting menu and the desserts! The artichoke appetizer is by far my favorite item on the menu. Since everyone had to do the vegetarian option we decided to just go with the regular prix fixed menu since my son did not want to do the vegetarian tasting menu. I still had the artichoke appetizer followed by the Dover sole and finished it with the honey panna cotta. The service was seamless and our waiter was so patient with us explaining the different types of fish to my son. While Le Bernardin is known for the fresh seafood, you cannot ignore the basket of freshly baked breads and the beautifully decorated desserts. Each dessert is a piece of art. I highly recommend you try this restaurant and enjoy all aspects of it because it truly nourishes your taste buds and your eyesight. I give it my GoldnAdvice seal of approval."

Le Bernardin,50,Top quality and modern,"Formal European style dinner, we enjoyed every dish, in particular the tuna with sea urchin and the tuna with foil gras. The service is very professional but every member of the staff even if extremely competent managed to make everyone very comfortable.  The only thing that I would improve is acustics that because due to the size of the ambiance the noise can be loud at times."

Le Bernardin,50,The Bernadin what Else !!,Service Food Is perfection 3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Well deserved Thanks Eric Next time to see you if you are to busy 👍 Thanks again for this very special diner

Le Bernardin,50,Seafood at the highest level,"We went for the prix fixe lunch menu. The space was classy, with the fantastic ocean scene on the back wall reminding us why we were there. Every dish was beautifully-presented and delicious, using a deft hand to prevent any ingredient from overpowering the star, top-quality seafood. The steamed halibut and Peruvian chocolate tart were highlights. The sommelier, one of three (at lunch nonetheless!) recommended a red Burgundy by the glass that paired wonderfully with the charred octopus and halibut. Attentive but unobtrusive service. A special meal."

Le Bernardin,50,Lived up to every expectation,"This is not just amazing food, this is the highest level of creativity and perfection of execution. The chef’s menu and wine tasting was an incredible experience."

Le Bernardin,50,One word: amazing,"Is it that good? Yes, it is that good. Amazing. This is how an unforgettable experience feels like. Your biggest problem is going to be what you chose. And you cannot go wrong. Thank you Eric."

Le Bernardin,50,Best food I’ve ever eaten,"If you are looking for excellent service, great wine pairing and excellent food then you should book here. Don’t skimp and think the a la carte will do, go for the tasting menu if you can. The scallops in particular are amazing. The reservations are released 7am (EST) on the first for the month ahead. Remember to set an alert to book as close to that time as possible if there’s a particular reservation that you want."

Le Bernardin,50,Lunch was Superb,"I was just ok with my previous visit a few years ago but LOVED the City Harvest lunch menu offerings this past February. I sat at the bar and really enjoyed the exceptional service provided to me by Kosta. I mentioned that I would be attending the matinee for Moulin Rouge ( a must see!) and Kosta assured me he would get me to the musical on time which he did. Both the Moulin Rouge and Summer Wind cocktails were fantastic and I also enjoyed a terrific Riessdorfkolsch beer. Bread assortment is very nice. All 3 courses were perfect, not just excellent but perfect. The $163 (not including gratuity) for what I received was money very well spent and I look forward to Le Bernadin on my next visit to NYC."

Le Bernardin,10,Myth Debunked,"Myth debunked  I have not been to the restaurant for many years and after reading wonderful reviews I thought it a great place to celebrate my wife's 85th birthday. Needless to say it was extremely hard to get a reservation fortunately my American Express platinum card enabled me to get a reservation at 5:45 PM last night.  As I remembered it still is an extremely beautiful place. But after my experience last night I cannot encourage anybody to go to this restaurant - be prepared to spend $500 for such a mediocre experience.  If for some reason you do go do not sit in the rear of the restaurant, there is the entrance to the kitchenand your head will spin with the constant flow of people going in and out- completely distracting dining.  I am 90 years old, been to 57 countries and have eaten in the finest restaurants in the world – this certainly is not one of them. There is a constant interference by waiters and etc. instead of fine unobtrusive service found in fine restaurants/  All of the above could be forgiven if the food lived up to its reputation.  You have two choices to start with followed by one entrée and dessert($185).  To start with we ordered the langostino which was overcooked and sent back. For the entrée i ordered the fluke and after the experience of the starter I asked the waiter please do not overcook it. It came well done, overcooked and tasteless and sent this back, After this 2nd experience I declined ordering anything else. My wife did enjoy her halibut.  For dessert she ordered a Carmel dessert- just adequate.  They only charged me alacart for the items I ate.  At a price which will exceed $250 a person with wine and drinks one would expect much more. It's all about fussiness and the presentation rather than great seafood and elegant service.  Happy 85 to my beautiful wife,"

Le Bernardin,50,Lovely Fall Lunch!,"We were able to have lunch here while in town for a long weekend. We were very pleased with our experience. The staff was very nice. We had some great wine pairings with our courses. Ideally, the seating would be a little more spaced apart but this is NYC where space is at a premium. The food was outstanding. We would definitely return."

Le Charlot,10,Rushed us in and out,I took a family friend for dinner. We were rushed from the beginning . My reservation was at 6.30 and at 7.20 they gave me the bill and made me feel rushed. And said they needed the table. At 7.30 they came back while I was still drinking tea and said we had to go. I complained to the manager who tried to say they always give at least 1.5 hours per booking. I showed him my reservation and in truth - he wasn’t that sorry or cared. I won’t go back.

Le Charlot,20,Average food. Bad service,"The quality of the food was average. Too expensive for the flavors, presentation and quantity of the dishes. The worst part was the attitude of the guy with white shirt which was acting as a host. When i asked about a place to park the scooters he told me “that’s not my problem”. It’s incredible how a customer can receive that type of answer in a place like this. The other waiters “in black” were in contrast really helpful. Bad experience. Will not come back"

Le Charlot,50,Excellent food & a great location,"We were walking the streets to the east of Central Park looking for somewhere to eat a quick lunch when we stumbled across Le Charlot.    Even though it was a cool February day we happily sat outside with our toddler in the stroller and enjoyed a pavement lunch (under a heater) in a typical French style.    The menu was not huge which is a good thing, especially at lunch, so we had mango chicken curry and steak au poivre. Both dishes were very well cooked and were extremely tasty.    The meal was topped off with a couple of glasses of red wine and a creme brulee to complete the authentic French lunch experience.    The location was very pleasant, situated on a quiet side street within a fairly affluent and trendy neighbourhood so the traffic noise was very low and there were plenty of interesting passers by to look at and wonder how the other half live!    The service could have been a bit quicker. Us and one other person were the only  customers seated outside and it felt as though the staff could have attended to us quicker than they did but this didn't spoil the experience at all as we were in no rush to be on our way.    I would definitely recommend this place.    https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d534194-r880693440-Le_Charlot-New_York_City_New_York.html#"

Le Charlot,50,Pleasant surprise,"I wanted a new place to celebrate my birthday. The staff was welcoming. The duck rolls apetizer was excellent, as was the steak au poivre. The staff was attentive but not overly so. The decor was welcoming. It all made for a very pleasant evening."

Le Charlot,40,Used to be a good spot but covid came !,The French management gone this French to be restaurant became a pale shadow of before.  The food is ok but service is not great and then number of people and close table is not really c19 protective.    Some of the clients were speaking very loudly (to the point that you could hear your own guests) and eat very dirty (using the tablecloth as a napkin fill of stain so that might’ve the reason why we were quite disappointed compared than before.    But the place has the capacity to improve so… c’on guys !

Le Charlot,40,Very good salad and mussels near the Armory and Hunter College,"My wife and I enjoyed our lunch here: Endive Salad ($18) was skimpy on the Roquefort, but otherwise was very good. I had Thai Mussels and my wife had Curry Mussels ($30 each), both very good in large portions with great fries. Service was fine. Review saying the restaurant was terrible seems fake, and the review talking about crammed tables has to be pre-pandemic, so ignore both of them. We'll come bqack."

Le Charlot,10,Terrible Restaurant,Food and service were very subpar. Service was slow and food was not well prepared. They ran out of several dishes on their menu. Servers were disorganized and poor at their job. One member of our party never got her meal.

Le Charlot,50,Nice French food,"This restaurant was very nice. I had the endive salad and the tuna tartare which was delicious. We had a Caesar salad and the chicken wrap. The service was excellent. There weren’t many choices for the kids, but they were happy with salad and fries. Crime brûlée was great! It was nice and cool inside and they had a little patio outside."

Le Charlot,40,Good Neighbourhood Eatery,"They cram a lot of tables I to this French restaurant and a table for two you have problems placing plates, glasses and bottles at the same time! My wife and I shared the Ceviche of shrimp and scallop, the Onion Soup and then each had Steak and Frite. The food was excellent and they had a nice Pinot Noir by the glass. Service friendly and timely."

Le Charlot,50,"Consistent quality, good service and nice ambiance","We have been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years, the consistency of the service, the quality of the food and the coziness of the ambience makes this little restaurant a hidden gem in Manhattan. We definitely love it and never had a bad experience at all.  It is s no miss for your next stop in the city"

Le Charlot,40,Le Charlot NY,"There are some important differences between little restaurants in France and little French restaurants in NY.  The basic is pricing.  The restaurant experience was enjoyable, we received the food we wanted well prepared and by really polite waiter.  But no matter how good the ambience was 200$ for two onion soups and three salats is a bit too much."

Le Charlot,50,This restaurant was not on,This restaurant was not on our radar but a chance meeting with a high profile political figure led to his recommendation of this restaurant. We felt safe taking his word on it and knew he would not lead us wrong. We were not disappointed! Service was attentive and food was divine. It was a lovely meal ending a memorable visit to the city.

Le Charlot,40,Intimate but noisy,"First time we have eaten at le Charlot. Small French bistro. Good service but very noisy. Classic French food nothing out of the ordinary but well presented and served. We went in the evening, lunch may be quieter. Expensive wine list. Upper East priced food."

Le Charlot,50,Great lunch,"We stopped here for lunch on the recommendation of the people at the Frick and were glad we did. Service was a little inconsistent with some of us being served and others having to wait quite a while for their meals. The onion soup was divine and the goat cheese omelet was excellent. Though it would have been nice to have everyone (5 of us) eating together, the food was excellent."

Le Charlot,50,Onion soup,"We go to Le Charlot whenever we're in the neighborhood. One dish we ALWAYS get is their French onion soup. Having been to Paris a few times, we have found their soup to be better than most places in Paris. After that the moules with the best French fries are always good. The appetizers are always fresh and the salads crisp and tasty. There are hot and cold entrees that are prepared to order. We have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful. We highly recommend this restaurant."

Le Charlot,30,Fake french,French restaurant only in the name. The service is very poor from the service of wine until the managers comportement. Many minuses for a restaurant at that prices. Dont recommend.

Le Charlot,40,Mules fritte best entree,"Classy atmosphere and good food, can be very tight and noisy, mostly upper East side crowd. Salmon is also a good choice"

Le Charlot,40,Very enjoyable bistro dinner,Had a very nice Friday evening dinner here. The maitre d' very courteously accommodated our request for an outdoor table. The room has a lively atmosphere and charming decor. Service was friendly and prompt. My country pate and chicken was excellent.

Le Charlot,50,My favorite lunch spot in NY,"My favorite lunch spot when shopping on Madison Avenue in New York. Stop by for wine, delicious mussels and perfect fries. The staff is French with very nice service."

Le Colonial,50,Highly recommend,We were pleasantly surprised by how much we loved this restaurant. The atmosphere and food were both excellent. We don’t eat at the same restaurants often in Chicago because there are so many to try - but this is one we would go back

Le Colonial,50,I would give seven stars if I could.,"I would give seven stars if I could.  The service, food and atmosphere is superb.  I have worked, stayed and dined in some of the best hotels, private clubs, venues and restaurants in the world.  Le Colonial Chicago is amazing.  I do not drink alcohol and so my waiter described and served me a fantastic mocktail.  The food was excellent, with flavours pouring out, beautifully presented. Some of the best I have had in any restaurant.  The star of the show was the glazed red snapper which my waiter filleted for me at the table. When I asked if I could have the cheeks, he knew exactly what I wanted and served me beautifully. A true professional.  Throughout the evening, the waiting staff serving me built a comfortable rapport and set the tone for what was to be an incredible dining experience.  I was made to feel very, very special and this is what hospitality is all about.  Thank you to the team at Le Colonial Chicago."

Le Colonial,40,Enjoyed lunch,It was a nice place to enjoy lunch! I was grateful for the gluten free items on the menu as well. The atmosphere was excellent.

Le Colonial,10,"Rude staff, average food.","Priority treatment here is given to locals, therefore I recommend you find somewhere else if you are merely visiting Chicago. I understand the need to look after the customers who will return on a regular basis, rather than the passing business of people visiting Chicago perhaps only once. But please don't make it so obvious.  Rude reception staff, who seem to think they are doing you a favour by allowing you to dine here. Food average at best."

Le Colonial,40,"Casual Asian dining, good flavors and reasonable service","Le Colonial is a chain of Eastern Asian restaurants, usually with pleasant ambiance, good food and efficient service. We had visited several of their franchises, but this was our first visit to the one in Chicago. Located towards the North end of the Mile, it is surrounded by multiple high-end restaurants, shops and stores. It is on a second floor, with excellent security and friendly, efficient service. The restaurant itself looks tired, in need of an update. The food, while good, didn't match similar dishes we had enjoyed in other Le Colonial sites (Houston, Atlanta). The wine list was creditable, but not outstanding. Prices were what you would expect from the area, but in excess of what we got in terms of quality."

Le Colonial,10,Don't Go,Terrible dinner! Very disappointed with our waiter who seemed to have better things to do rather then serving us dinner.

Le Colonial,10,"Bad, not for Black folks","Obnoxious staff, if you’re Black you sit in the back and don’t dare ask questions. Rude hostess. Super dark to the point where we couldn’t read the menu. It’s not a place for Black folks to go spend their hard earned dollars."

Le Colonial,50,Fantastic Food and Five Star Service,"Had a great time at Le Colonial, this is one of the best spots for dining in Chicago. Service was superb, one of the best I've experienced in Chicago. Food was phenomenal and the overall ambiance was top notch. We will try their brunch menu next time we are in town, this place is now part of my list of top five dining spots in Chicago."

Le Colonial,40,Taken to another place,This restaurant is pricey. Now with that said the rest is great. The place is an experience. From your trip up the elevator to the aroma of incense and the Vietnamese decor at the hostess station. The hostess greets you in traditional Vietnamese clothing and escorts you to a table. It’s like waking into a tropical Asian oasis. The food is so good and fun to share. Atmosphere top notch as is wait staff. We really enjoyed this restaurant.

Le Colonial,40,Colonial Tastes in a City losing its Taste,"This is a pleasant restaurant to enjoy Vietnamese cuisine with a French twist.  Service is pretty good, and vibe is from by-gone era. In a city where history is thrown in the history bin, this is a place where you can enjoy some good food and classic vibe. I believe it is a bit too hyped and overrated. However, it is offering a good experience for a steep tab."

Le Colonial,50,Splendid,Had a 3 hour relaxed lunch with a party of 6. Everything was great. Wonderful dishes with unique ingredients and flavors. Atmosphere is top notch as was the service and food. So relaxing and enjoyable on a lazy winter Saturday in Chicago. The establishment takes some heat for its prices which is peculiar to me. If your not looking at menus and prices before you chose a restaurant then shame on you. To me the money spent was well worth it. Been here a few times before this trip and will continue to be a customer. Splendid.

Le Colonial,40,Lunch on Oak street,Nice place for lunch in the heart of downtown Chicago. The service is nice and servers are courteous. Food is ok. I guess it is oriental. Not too filling but it's ok. You still feel light after a meal. Somewhat expensive.

Le Colonial,40,Good food but we won’t be returning here,"The food was quite good and the presentation attractive. The service was prompt and efficient and the atmosphere was evocative of the theme. The problem was the many hard surfaces coupled with a filled dining room made it almost too difficult to talk and be heard at our table for two. Also this was a major wedding anniversary and I guess I have been spoiled over the years by receiving some sort of recognition from the restaurant-alas not here. Why ask us if it doesn’t matter? In any case let me say that Dina our server did a nice job. Our Martinis were great and we chose to share 4 small plates which were beautifully presented and tasted great. We had Cha Gio (Crispy Shrimp & Pork Rolls), Goi Cuon ( Chilled Shrimp Rolls), Ca Song (Spicy Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare) and Ca Bam (Hanoi Style Monkfish). So the food & service moved it from a 3 to a 4 Star review. The noise and the lack of recognition (we have had everything from a gracious congratulation to free food from other establishments) conspired to lower the rating and means we won’t be going back there. I doubt they will mind."

Le Colonial,50,Excellent,"We stopped by here for lunch while shopping. The food and ambiance is just perfect. I had a salad. It was absolutely delicious and I loved how light it was, but still so full of flavor and fresh. My only complaint is that I wish it had more chicken on it. I also had the ceviche and I think it was some of the best I’ve ever tried. If you haven’t tried this restaurant, it’s a must in Chicago. Would love to return for dinner next time we’re in town."

Le Colonial,20,Dinner,"The food was mediocre at best, the service was excellent, the food, wine and liquor was incredibly overpriced. The end result is a very poor value. We went to Le Colonial based on Trip Advisor reviews and we were very disappointed."

Le Colonial,50,Holy Moly! So delicious!,"This place is gorgeous to look at, but most importantly, the food is exceptional. The service is excellent as well. We six enjoyed all aspects of the evening, but if you go on a quieter evening, try to get seated in the back dining room-- so elegant. We were in the front and it was fine since it was quieter. You can't go wrong with any choice. Great selections for vegetarians if you are into that. Highly recommended!"

Le Colonial,50,Great Vietnamese Experience,"This was a great restaurant. I loved the ambiance and the service. We had cocktails, appetizers, main dishes, and dessert. See the pictures!"

Le Colonial,50,Great experience,"Recommended by a friend and boy was he right. Everything was wonderful and tasty. Appetizers, dinner and dessert were perfect. Great location and nicely done restaurant on the 3rd floor of the building. Great service as well"

Le Gamin,40,Nice atmosphere and good service,"Ok, caveat to this review, we were here on Thanksgiving evening, so our experience was unique. There was no menu, everyone got the same dinner including turkey medallions. The food was very good, and no complaints, but I can't talk to the overall menu. Our...More"

Le Gamin,40,Very French,"Friendly service and good French menu. In a comfortable setting. Disappointed that there was no Canadian wine on the list but otherwise, a good place to eat."

Le Gamin,50,Excellent casual dinner.,Excellent food and service. Sat outside on an warm evening.. we had beef tartare and the mushroom ravioli … both excellent and not too heavy. A very casual atmosphere…did not feel rushed at all! Loved the diversity of the area!

Le Gamin,40,Great food. Small portions.,"We arrived late on a Thursday evening and were greeted by an energetic knowledge accommodating server. She assisted with wine choice that was awesome. Limited menu, but highly recommend . Enjoy !"

Le Gamin,20,Overpriced and overrated,"Disappointing, few options. No beef bourguignon that night, instead they offered a steak with mashed potatoes, subpar for sure. Overpriced at $30. The onion soup was good, but that was only option. Would not recommend"

Le Gamin,40,Enjoy a great dinner on Prince Arthur!,Great food and service! Prince Arthur has gone through changes and seems to be getting better again. Our waitress was great and had good wine suggestions. Great outdoor seating.

Le Gamin,10,HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE,Communicating with the management team at this restaurant has been by far one of the most challenging experiences I've had working with a venue. I would stay far far away from this place if you're planning any type of group event.

Le Gamin,50,Excellent place for post-meeting wrap up dinner,We had a long table on a level all to ourselves and the service and food were excellent. We were a group of about 25 people.

Le Gamin,40,Like in Paris,"A cosy place in a nice neighbourhood. Felt like a bistro in Paris. Had a great duck dish and some local, nice wine."

Le Gamin,50,Excellent service and food,"With the highly professional assistance provided by Benoit, a group of 30 guests had a wonderful evening with a beautiful set up, excellent and original food choices, carefully chosen wine, and a relaxing and laid-back atmosphere. For special events, groups, or just a meal out with friends, if I lived in Montréal, I would be a regular here."

Le Gamin,50,Outstanding food French-food and service.,Our very fine waiter Bernard helped us choose from 5 different wines to accompany what we wanted from the menu. The meat and cheese board was stunningly prepared and is sufficient as a meal for at least one person. The lamb shank was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Bernard’s amicable demeanour and professional disposition was the cherry on top of this fine dining g experience.

Le Gamin,50,Drooling over Lamb Shank,"A few years ago I came up to Montreal for my bday. I had no clue where to go and a friend recommended this place. Many trips and years latter I keep coming here.  It looks like a typical french style restaurant but the food is divine and the service is great and friendly ( and cute) and helpful. I have yet to been steered wrong. The staff switches between french and english easly and evening understands my french when I'm stumbling though it and they make sure you know and can get home after a few drinks.  The Lamb shank I drool thinking about it, it just falls of the bone. The soups and fois gras fill  me up.  They are always very accommodating, there was a issue with my last reservation ( it was a open table issue not theirs) but they went out of they way to accommodate me."

Le Gamin,50,Excellent meal,"A pleasant restaurant in a pedestrianised area off the Boulevard Saint Laurent. There are indoor and outdoor tables, but it was pouring with rain when I visited.  The food was very good, especially the daily special starter of chanterelle mushrooms. The service was friendly and attentive.  Recommended."

Le Gamin,50,Highly Recommended!,"This restaurant was a wonderful surprise. Beautiful location near Saint-Louis Square, friendly wait staff, and I had the best lamb shank that I've ever had. Would highly recommend this restaurant for those visiting the city and want an authentic french experience. Well done les deux gamins!"

Le Gamin,50,Wonderful evening,Superb food at moderate prices by Montreal standards. Friendly service. Street tables on a warm summer evening with live music made for a delightful evening. All good.

Le Gamin,40,Great Intro,"A perfect first night introduction of our visit to intriguing Montreal, this intimate classic & obviously popular bistro in a trendy neighborhood north of Sherbrooke offers an extensive menu of delicious French cuisine with daily specials & cordial service - either indoors or outside in the bustling sidewalk cafe."

Le Gamin,50,Fantastic French Fayre,"Lovely bistro serving authentic French food, served by great staff. The snails and frogs legs starters were amazing and all main courses so tasty. The restaurant was so good that we went back a 2nd time on our trip to Montreal."

Le Gamin,50,Great find,Very close to our hotel in a small neighborhood off the Main Street. Really great French restaurant that my wife thought was adorable. The Hanger steak and the risotto were excellent great brownie desert and good wine. Service was A+ as well.

Le Gamin,50,Best French onion soup,"It was the best meal I had during this trip to Montreal. The wait stuff is knowledgeable and friendly. The food was outstanding. The French onion soup was delicious and memorable! The best I had and I think even better than those I tried in Paris. It is a must to come to this restaurant! We wanted to go back there the next day for lunch. Unfortunately, they only open for dinner on the Easter Sunday."

Le Gamin,50,"Cozy neighborhood restaurant, fine food","This was recommended by Manoir Sherbrooke and is a block away. I dined here twice, both times having the soup of the day and the cappeletti, both delish. Very clean, excellent service, nice ambiance"

Le Gamin,40,Nice to eat outside,"We ate at this small restaurant twice as the food was very good. The second night was much busier and perhaps as a result the service was slower, but we still enjoyed being able to eat outside in September."

Le Gamin,30,There is no rating for ‘good’ and it wasn’t ‘very good’ so I have to say ‘average’.,"Our receptionist Carole at Armor Manoir Sherbrooke recommended the restaurant but it was closed on the night in question. Instead we booked a table next door at Le Square (see review). The following night we came to Les Deux Gamin and found a brightly lit and warm room on a freezing day. It was half-full but lacked atmosphere. We had a pleasant evening and the meals we had were pretty good. Although, my wife would have preferred the duck confit served with crispy skin. It’s difficult to say why, because there was nothing really wrong, but the whole experience was just ‘good’. In TA ratings that has has to be ‘average’ unfortunately."

Le Gamin,40,"Good service, excellent french cuisine, good wine list",On a Friday night we were looking for a restaurant around 8 pm and lucked out to find this good restaurant. We enjoyed the french onion soup and I had the hanger steak...all was delicious. The server was excellent and highly recommend this restaurant.

Le Gamin,30,Decreasing food quality,"I ate here a year ago and fall in love with the restaurant. Therefore, when I came back to Montreal this year I came back to this restaurant and brought along my family as well. Nothing much changed environmental wise, but the manageress who served us last time was not there anymore. This time there was one waitress serving the whole restaurant and she was very busy. She was very nice and provided great service nonetheless. We ordered the discovery board, onion soup, escargot, beef tartare and duck confit (which I had last time and it melted my heart). The discovery board (i.e. the cheese and charcuterie) was as good as I remembered, and the bread was also very nice. After that, things start going downhill, starting with the onion soup. The onions were not sauteed enough and still very crunchy. Some pieces were actually fibrous and tough. It was not seasoned enough nor baked enough to have the cheese surface browned. The flavour was watery. Overall, the soup was worse than the frozen ones I get from Costco. The escargot was ok, but not amazing. As for the beef tartare, again the seasoning is not as flavourful as I expected. This lack of flavour becomes very prominent in the duck confit. The duck was made well with the skin crunchy, but it just lacks flavour!    After tasting the mains and hot dishes, my heart was just broken and I lost my appetite for dessert. I don't know what happened to the restaurant, but I had such high expectations from my previous visit which it couldn't deliver this time.    Hopefully the food can improve. It has a good atmosphere and location."

Le Gamin,10,Thanksgiving Dinner.,"I usually do not write reviews on restaurants but I had to share our experience at Les Deux Gamins. We chose this restaurant because it serves a Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. My husband and I were visiting Montreal for the weekend to spend some time with our daughter who is going to McGill University. We were looking for a restaurant that serves a traditional Thanksgiving meal and Les Deux Gamins is one of the few in Montreal. We are a family of five and all of us were not impressed by this restaurant. The service was incredibly slow, the turkey dinner was tasteless....not a yummy thanksgiving meal at all. And the dessert, a pumpkin cheesecake, was basically very hard pucks of crust with a tasteless filling. And the bill was outrageous! I don’t mind spending more for a meal if it’s a great meal, but this was such a disappointing meal and experience on such a special family night."

Le Gamin,40,Well designed French restaurant.,"Nice look to the restaurant. Has a European feel. Very good, attentive service. Excellent French onion soup. Steak tartar was a bit too cold and chewy. Otherwise the rest of the meal was good."

Le Gamin,50,Charming neighborhood bistro,"Very good food, somewhat limited menu, fish quite good, lamb and steak both looked good from afar. Decent pricing. Excellent service. On a nice pedestrian block in a charming neighborhood near our hotel on Rue Sherbrooke."

Le Gamin,50,Best crème brûlée in MTL,"I really enjoyed the place and the food.  We had a family dinner outside in a flowery side walk street. Staff was perfect and ensure we were fully comfortable.  French recipes are done perfectly.  I recommend duck foie gras with warm French baguette, salmon or beef tartare, oignon soup and the Famous crème brûlée!  Thank you to your warm welcome.  Virginie"

Le Gamin,50,Dining on the Terrasse is a Treat!,"This bistro on rue Prince Arthur East is a great place to dine under the stars in Montreal. The neighborhood is full of funky little places and you will be sure to see and hear buskers and street salsa dancers as you stroll to dinner. The menu is simple and very good, complemented by a great wine list. Our server was very knowledgeable, and was able to suggest a great wine to accompany our cod and duck. All wait staff seemed very friendly and bilingual."

Le Gamin,40,Alfresco Dining on Rue Prince-Albert,"On our first night in Montreal (a Friday), my wife and I picked this place out of many on Rue Prince-Albert for dinner. The ambience is wonderful and the food is quite good. One caveat is the servings are a little small. Good service."

Le Gamin,40,Restaurant with a Paris feel,"This restaurant was in a much older building but they had a great a patio with a Paris feel to it. The service was ok, the servers had large sections but were decent. The food was good but appy portions were a bit small. All in all it was a good experience and I'd go back."

Le Gamin,50,Great food!,Loved the duck confit! Very cute French restaurant with a large outdoor area on a pedestrian street.

Le Gamin,30,Rude staff member ruined experience,The food was okay but it was difficult to eat in such hot circumstances (sitting outside in heatwave with no fan). We would not return as our experience was ruined by a rude member of staff.

Le Gamin,50,Adorable,"I found this walking by with my sister and enjoyed my time here twice in one day. Reasonably priced drinks, delicious sangria, excellent appetizers. This restaurant has such cozy outdoor seating and friendly staff."

Le Gamin,50,Excellent local,"On a quaint pedestrian street near the center of Montreal is this charming local haunt. Moderately priced, especially given the quality of the food. Reasonably priced wines too off a somewhat small but very viable list."

Le Gamin,40,Reasonably priced and delicious,Very good dinner! With great service. We had the special appetizer. Escargot was my not favorite and the entrees could use a tad bit more salt but overall really good

Le Gamin,40,Worth the Wait,"After finding our planned restaurant closed on Monday's we just happened upon this gem. Luckily we arrived early enough (7:30) and were able to get a table without a reservation, but if you plan on eating around 8 I'd call ahead.  The menu wasn't overwhelming as so many can be but everything was enticing making our decision difficult. After ordering they bring warm baguette with butter in a basket that was enjoyable. We started with French Onion Soup, Escargots a l'Espagnole and Beef Tartare. All three were outstanding, the Beet Tartare was spiced perfectly and the Spanish preparation of the Escargots was delicious and creative.  As the main course, I had Beef Hanger Steak, which was prepared to perfection with a Sauce Echalotes, Champignons, Salad de Legumes and small red potatoes. I truly can not say enough about everything on the plate-exquisite! My husband had the same and also devoured every bite using the bread to clean his plate. Our daughter ate the Morue Pochee (Poached Cod) with crushed Walnuts, Sunflower and Pumpkin seeds and sauteed vegetables in white wine, also delectable. We washed it down with a bottle of Secret de Lunes, a 2016 Pinot Noir.  My only criticism was that we had to wait quite awhile for the main course. As I mentioned, it was busy and it seems there were only two lovely gentlemen taking care of everyone which I'm sure contributed to the delay. Had we not waited as long I would have given them a perfect rating so I will see what happens on our next visit, although I was warned that as the weather gets nicer they get busier. I will say it again, every bite was worth the wait."

Le Gamin,30,Good But Wouldn’t Return,Maybe the challenge for us was it was hyped up to be an amazing eatery for steak and seafood so our expectations were very high from many aspects. The menu was rather limited with only poached cod as the seafood option. The appetizers were good as well as the lamb shank but the 45oz steak was rather tough and not much flavor beyond the seasoning on the outside. The service was also good so overall good but there’s just too many great spots to settle for good in Montreal.

Le Gamin,50,Wonderful Meal and Service,Excellent restaurant with a great wine list. Service was impeccable. Pacing was perfect. My wife had steak and I had duck confit. Both were excellent. Also highly recommend the French onion soup.

Le Gigot,50,Wonderful dining experience,"Food, ambience and service all top notch. A pleasure able experience from start to finish. I felt like I was in Southern France for an evening."

Le Gigot,50,Feels like Paris,"This cozy restaurant was an authentic Parisian bistro - packed in small tables, loud jovial conversation and a menu with all of my favorite French bistro staples such as escargot, beef Bourginon and the best boullabaisse I've had in the US. It was romantic, delicious and the staff was amazing. I'm keeping this one on my NYC restaurants must go-tos."

Le Gigot,50,Another Perfect Anniversary,"I can never say enough wonderful things about Le Gigot. We had our Wedding Anniversary dinner there last week and as always it was excellent.  I rave about this lovely restaurant every year for a reason. The excellent cuisine and lovely ambience always remain the same.  My husband had the rack of lamb (his favorite). He said it was absolutely sumptuous. I had the Coq au vin. It too was delicious. The desserts are also fabulous. Our favorite is the Tarte Tatin  The wine list is as good as ever. Our fabulous server, Daniel recommended a wine that we really enjoyed. Daniel's knowledge of fine wine is as good if not better than any sommelier you could hope to meet.  Of course, the success of this restaurant is due to the beautiful owner/host Pamela. We have all been through a lot over the past two years and through it all,  this restaurant has never veered off course. The atmosphere and the kindness of the people who work there (Daniel, Derrick, Andreus) always make you feel welcome and so happy to come back.  By the way, we also enjoy going for brunch. It doesn't have to be a special occasion to enjoy this lovely, romantic restaurant. It is and always will be a gem.  We highly recommend it - can't wait to go back."

Le Gigot,40,Perfect neighborhood French Bistro,"Tonight was our first visit to this lovely 25 year old French bistro. While the tiny restaurant was mostly full on a snowy Sunday night, we appeared to be the only couple. This surprised us because Le Gigot is very romantic. The menu is small and filled with classic French dishes that you are happy to put in the hands of an experienced chef. Boeuf Bourguignon, duck confit and cassoulet are all large home cooking projects best left to the pros. We had a crab cake (my favorite dish of the night), spinach soup, duck confit, and steak (brandy peppercorn sauce). Dessert was tarte tatin and creme brulee. All with a nice bordeaux. Everything was executed wonderfully, and the service was pitch perfect. We enjoyed our server very much. We are excited to make this our regular for neighborhood French, as we can't wait to try the rest of the menu. We loved the unassuming confidence about this little place. You don't stay around in this competitive neighborhood for 25 years without having some game."

Le Gigot,50,Still The Best,"I realize I have reviewed this restaurant many times in the past but the test of a restaurant's true culinary greatness is consistency. This beautiful little restaurant is still our favorite in this city.  With all of the difficulties and restrictions that have been placed on dining establishments, Le Gigot still manages to turn out the most delicious dishes. My husband and I have enjoyed dining at this lovely French restaurant for many years. Every dish on the menu is a sheer delight to the palate. The presentation is exquisite and beautiful Pamela (the owner) and her staff make you feel so welcome. I always savor these meals and feel a little sad when they are over. I always look forward to going back.  We always enjoy having dinner at Le Gigot but we also love the weekend brunches.  The great thing about the menu is that the dinner menu is available even at brunch. My husband and I have enjoyed having Boeuf Bourguignon and the delicious Poulet at 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon! We have tried practically every dish on the menu and they are all outstanding. The wines and desserts are also excellent.  This lovely restaurant has helped us keep our sanity through these difficult months. It is our escape back to Paris. The ambiance is lovely and the food is sublime.  I highly recommend it.  By the way, the staff is fully vaccinated and all safety protocols are in place."

Le Gigot,50,So Good To Be Back!,"In this world we live in now, it's nice to know that there are some things that remain constant. Thank God our favorite restaurant in this city, Le Gigot is one of those things.    My husband and I celebrated our Anniversary as we have done for years at Le Gigot on Sunday. As always, our meal was beyond excellent. I had one of my favorite dishes, the Poulet with Potatoes Gratin and Vegetables. It was absolutely delicious. I always have a hard time choosing between that and the also delicious Boeuf Bourguignon. My husband had the Seafood Risotto. He enjoyed it immensely. The seafood was fresh and the creamy risotto was perfect. For dessert, we had melt in your mouth Sorbet. We also enjoyed several glasses of wine from their excellent collection.    It was wonderful to see the beautiful owner, Pamela again after so many months of being locked down. As always, she greets her diners as if they were guests in her living room. The staff of servers, Daniel, Derrick, Andreus and John also know how to make you feel at home. They make you feel like family.    By the way, the Brunch Menu is also excellent. At Le Gigot you can get dinner dishes at Brunch also. We have been guilty of doing that many times!    Let me add that in during this crisis, safety is of the utmost importance. Le Gigot has implemented excellent safety protocols. We felt absolutely safe there. As a matter of fact, it is the only restaurant we have dined at since dining opened up.    It is so important to support the restaurants that we love during this time. We look forward to going back to our elegant French Bistro very soon. Every meal we have ever had there has been sublime."

Le Gigot,50,A Bit of Paris in New York City,"Food presentation, service, preparation and atmosphere were all above par. This is a Parisian style bistro with very few tables in a small space. The staff provided impeccable service, right down to serving the bread with spoons as serving tongs. The meal was delicious and the portions were ample. Every detail was French, except no attitude."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Gem,"Lovely ambience and service; delicious food; a gem of a place. We ate steak, fries, sautéed potatoes, sorbet, mousse and mixed out own lemon sodas. Around us people ordered escargot, mussels and steak tartare. Lovely."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Good,"Hello , I nknow Le Jarding quite long time since 1998 till today , I enjoy very much food of Le Jardin special "" A fish deep with Butter and other was Pork with MashPotatoes . I love it . Merci Mr Khanh . Voici ManhHa"

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Sensaish !!!!!!!!!!,"This was a great restaurant …… Our party of four enjoyed pate, cheese platter, beef carpaccio and a prawn cocktail for starters served with a basket of well made French baguette. Very well received by all !  For mains we had a couple of the specials strip loin steak very very very good. One of the better steaks we have had outside of Australia.! The other meals veal and a French onion soup were all great.  A variety of french desserts crème brûlée , crème caramel and apple crumble were all outstanding. Service was attentive helpful and well above premium.  Vuong/Tony our waiter along with the rest of the team were really fantastic . Deserving go the highest praise."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Best french restaurant with a nice garden,Me and my family come to this restaurant once/month. The food is great and it is nice to eat in a garden in the center of busy Ho Chi Minh City. They have fresh salad and a lot of french dishes. We will come back again

Le Jardin Bistro,20,Looks good but is not,"The best thing about this restaurant, is the bad attitude you expect at a french restaurant. Food is boring. I got a duck’s leg with some McDonald french fries without ketchup. It looks fancy from the outside but dont judge a book by its cover."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Easter Lunch at Le Jardin,We had our lunch at Le Jardin with family and friends on the Easter Sunday after mass. It turned out to be a great place to hang out and enjoy some delicious French/European menu. It has an outdoor garden space where you can enjoy your meals if you don't prefer being inside the restaurant.

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Classical French Fare,Nice garden setting with classical French fare. They ran out of the French onion soup but the salad nicoise was good. Large portion of mussels in cream sauce although a bit salty. Beef cheeks were tender and in line with expectations. Nice bread. Worth a visit!

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Excellent,"Excellent- came back after many years and the food was as great, the ambiance as nice and the value for the money as good as ever!"

Le Jardin Bistro,30,Nice ambiance but average quality steak,"Came on a rainy day for family dinner as per suggestion from a local foodie. The place is pretty nice hidden inside of a busy area with its old colognial architecture. The salad and starter were quite good with mild seasoning to wake up the palate. However, the Ribeye steak served with tartar sauce was quite disappointing since the texture was unacceptable hard and dried compared to medium rare request."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Authentic French restaurant,"Fantastic REAL French food(steak tartare just like in Paris). Great atmosphere, good service, pleasant prices"

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Fantastic lunch,"We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and all our meals were fantastic. The pork hock, duck confit, chicken in goat cheese and basi were all very tasty but the beef check in red wine was absolutely superb. We drank the house wine and shared a selection of desserts. I’d definitely return."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Great food. Great prices. Great service.,"Really enjoyable. Nice garden setting. Wonderful Menu. Surprisingly good food, at a very cheap price. Friendly, accommodating staff. Highly recommended as a hidden gem."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,So good I had to go back!,"This is a great middle priced french bistro with lots of French classics, a lovely environment and terrific staff.    My golden rule of travel is don't eat at the same place twice. Well Le Jardin caused me to break the rule.    The snails were to `die for' as was the duck.    Cannot recommend enough! Wish we had this restaurant in Brisbane."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Great French Food,Lovely dinner in an older building Friendly staff and host Food prepared quickly and very fresh Excellent menu Great desserts Very inexpensive Highly recommended

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Secret gem!,"At first we were unsure if we got the right place. We walked in without any reservations at 7pm on a rainy Friday night. The outside seating was empty and there was only a few tables instead. We ordered our food and then restaurant started getting busier.    We ordered escargots and it tasted like authentic French home style.  The duck confit skin was so crispy and the main had a choice of two side dishes.  Although the presentation was lacking, the flavors were superb!    After we paid our bill, the inside and outside seating was packed. I guess HCMC loves to eat later."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Nice inexpensive French restaurant,Went with friends for an evening meal. The escargot was not quite up to par but everything else was very good and at the prices who could complain? The restaurant is a little difficult to find as the street signage is not very good.

Le Jardin Bistro,40,"Outdoor garden, good food, low prices - what else do you need?","Le Jardin is an everyday authentic French restaurant in the center of Ho Chi Minh City. The garden is pleasant, even in hot weather. The food and service are good. It is ideal for a casual evening. Prices are low. It isn't shiny but it is real."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Le Jardin,The withlof with ham and grated cheese is delicious there. And they have apple crumble pie as desert! Price quality this is a great place to eat. And super service on top.

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Best French restaurant which we ever had in Vietnam,"A very nice cozy restaurant in HCM with a beautiful flaire.  In my opinion the best French restaurant which I have ever visited in Vietnam (HCM/Hanoi). Frank is managing the restaurant perfect and the food is very delicious. For starters we recommend especially the beef carpaccio, salmon carpaccio and 3 types of tuna.  This restaurant is always a""must"" when we come to HCM."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Loved it,I ate here two days in a row- the first day a great salmon steak and the second day a great fillet with pepper sauce and chips - I also tried the apple crumble and it was superb. This is a real hidden gem and I can’t wait to be in HCM again to eat here. I only wish I could find a similar place in Hanoi.

Le Jardin Bistro,50,"Duck Confit is one of my favorite items for lunch, Refinery is the best along with Villa Song . Le Jardin is in theSong","One of my selections for Lunch is Duck Confit. Refinery and Villa Song are the best , Le Jardine is in the top 3. The worst is Mad House and La Plancha , definitely stay away. When a restaurant doesn’t offer a reply to your review, means they really don’t care. To bad we’re local and not tourists."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Awesome food,The place was so decorate and well design. The food so tasty and reasonable price. Staff was friendly and helpful. All are perfect.

Le Jardin Bistro,30,"Savoir vivre, enjoy the evening out","Invited by my friend Michael from Australia, with another five friends (four from Ireland and one from USA) we enjoyed a nice evening with good food in the open air at Le Jardin. Of course, we choose from a card with European/French dishes: good taste, no large portions. Served by one waiter: correct, no special treat. Reasonable price, as you can expect in this city.  Although this is the wet season, no rain during the whole evening, so that was extra joy."Le Jardin Bistro,40,Gem,"Lovely ambience and service; delicious food; a gem of a place.

Le Jardin Bistro,10,Very disappointing experience,"Whilst I cannot comment on the food quality, I must say that I did not even get pass the manger to be seated... I was there close to 9pm, understanding that it will close soon... as I went in passing through the front gate, I was advised by the, as I guess, the manager that ""we are closed"" on a very blunt manner. Fine, I thought, even though there were still some tables of guests in the dining area. My biggest disappointment and to the extent anger came when I was just walking out... I saw 2 ladies being just seated at their table... and as I stood for a while, they were handed the menu... enough said.... major put down... which is in line with the feedback for this restaurant regarding the service level and attitude... never again will I consider to visit this place again... there are plenty of better places to visit in Saigon which I will be treated with respect."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Price worth visiting,"Nice dinner yesterday night in District 1 of HCMC.  You pay for what you have in your plate. All main courses between 150k and 250k.  I got myself a salmon for 220k and it was honest.  Nice outdoor area, meanwhile, the storm took us by surprise.  The AppleCrumble was good. Nice Manager, great talk."

Le Jardin Bistro,10,Overly rated restaurant and not worth a star !,"I am totally disappointed with the so-called French cuisine. I do not understand the rest of the comments quoting great food and gave 4 stars. Are those people who shares the comments have hardly eaten French food at all or rate the restaurant according to the limited French restaurants in HCM. I strongly doubted how accurate are those comments. The food serves cold (“not cold cut”), and just terrible. So many things not right at all. First of all, escargot was not serving hot with sizzling butter and may be cooking with microwave. It tasted like the defrosted escargot from the freezer which is completely tasteless. The plate’s decoration of our main course is messy, just like your angry mama trying to fill up the plate with food or some kind of canteen food. Don’t mention of the taste and the quality of the food at all. We are 5 of us and each of us ordering our main courses. I couldn’t understand why our server would drop off our main dishes in the middle of the table rather than serving the dishes to each of us. We are not eating in a Chinese restaurant for sharing dishes. Just unbelievable bad for our experience in this restaurant. If any doubt of my comments, go check it out yourself and shares your real experience. I am completely cheated with all the reviews."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,"Good food, poor servers","I have heard good things about this place as it is a fixture of the HCMC dining scene. Located at the French center it is the local bistro of choice for the Francophiles and French speaking populace in the city. The location is great deep in the heart of the city and the ambiance and location is great. Food wise, good, there is a sense of flair and passion to the menu, my only gripe is the lazy waiting staff who stare gormless at the customers and waddle around like doing their job is some kind of hardship. Considering the prices ain’t cheap I do expect better and would appreciate a little courtesy, but hey, it’s a French restaurant in Vietnam so what should we expect?"

Le Jardin Bistro,50,A nontraditional but unique French restaurant worth going,"Staying outdoor, the environment is relaxing and fresh. The food is great though not as dedicate as a very fine French restaurant."

Le Jardin Bistro,30,Decent location but food was average and cash only.,Location was nice. As Its name Le Jardin we dined in the garden. The evening would’ve been better if the food was up to par as the environment. The food was average at most. We did enjoy the onion soup and the duck but would stay away from the beef options as both the steak and beef bourguignon was other than tender.    And it was cash only.

Le Jardin Bistro,50,We Miss You,"Aubrey and I lived in SaiGon and moved to HaNoi yesterday. We individually or as a couple or with friends dined at Le Jardin at least once a week. I love and miss everything about the place, especially the staff, and the greenery and the aesthetic and the relatively inexpensive and great wine and the food. My mom was a gourmet cook in the French tradition, but American. This is the food I grew up on ... / liver with garlic. I worked on a small organic farm when a young girl and am now a health coach. It isn't just what you eat but the enviro in which you eat - breaking bread in a place like Le Jardin is a beautiful gift to your body mind soul."

Le Jardin Bistro,30,Le Jarfin -Ho Chi Minh,"Food average We ordered a few items. But the beef steak, pork cutlet which are just average, expecting better quality. Overall price is reasonable."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Great Place to Unwind and Chill,"I have been coming to Le Jardin for years and never tire of their steaks or red wine. The steaks are super affordable, as are the carfes of red wine, and are very pleasant and the pepper sauce is delicious. The French fries are normally piping hot which isn't easy for very thin cut fries and the salad is a good size portion with a very tasty french dressing. The service is quick and efficient and professional. It has taken a long time for the regular waiters to give me a smile of welcome or recognition when we arrive at the restaurant although they are always polite and friendly when they take your order, but it has finally happened after all these years haha. I suspect that because they are always full and have a huge turnover of customers it is difficult to remember all the regulars. That said it is a friendly little restaurant, with good food and wine and a great place for either a couple, solo or group of friends. Over the years we have been with many different friends and visitors and all of them have returned to the restaurant and spoken very highly of it. Final mention must be made of the delicious range of specialty ice creams, a delicious ending to what is always a very pleasant evening at Le Jardin."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Nice change,"I’ve been in Vietnam for the past 2 weeks,and a friend arranged a get together here last night,so first bit of western food.i had a steak with fries and Roquefort sauce,along with a couple of drinks.the steak was cooked just as I asked,the sauce was nice,the service was good,and there was a group of us,and everyone was pleased with their food and the service.it is what it is,a mid range mid priced restaurant,so no complaints,worth a visit."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Worth a try,Was recommended the steak by an ex pat. Super disappointed. But the service was 5/5- this is significant in Vietnam. The wine was reasonable at 700K for an Australian red. The dessert was 4+/5. We’ll be back to try the French fare.

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Good food with great price!,"Our family ordered beef tenderloin, duck confit, salmon, and all taste good. We were all happy with our food and the price, really really reasonable for a French restaurant. We have no complaints except the indoor sitting should have better air condition since HCMC can get really hot. Otherwise, we have no further complaints."

Le Jardin Bistro,40,Great pricing; overall brilliant but some misses,"The place was a little difficult to find - do note that it’s within the premises of the school compound. The air conditioned seating area is also really small; we had to seat outside and unfortunately breathed in smoke from the motorbike riders waiting outside.    Overall the portions are generous and the pricing is really amazing for French food. The service staff were also brilliant.    The escargots were not bad and the onion soup was really delicious. The ratatouille would be the star standout dish, with the duck leg confit a close second - with the fragrant meat oozing with flavour.    The red wine beef however was disappointing as the meat was hard. The mussels while generous in portion and relatively fresh, were let down by the watery and the lacking-in-taste cream sauce."

Le Jardin Bistro,20,Let down,"Place is busy with a lot of guest, idk why food is just only par.    Ordered steak, order medium came out rare asked to have it cook a but more it came out like shoe leather.    No one asked if the food was ok or checked on us. Sorry won't be back"

Le Jardin Bistro,40,"Great no frills, French food.",I've been wanting to visit this restaurant since arriving in HCMC. I finally got a chance after showing up late once and without a reservation....Definitely book a table in advance. It can fill up quickly on the weekend and limited seating. Good food at a reasonable price although I was a bit underwhelmed by the French Onion Soup. Still worth trying.

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Typical french fare in the middle of HCMC,"What a pleasant surprise it was to stumble across this place when walking through HCMC. The garden setting is beautiful and provides a respite from the noisy streets; the extensive typical french menu caters to every taste, and they have a good wine selection. I came here with a large group and everyone was happy, young and not so young!    The owner was helpful; the staff was not so friendly but ok.    Le Jardin is very popular so it's important to book in advance."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,Nice family restaurant,Good value for your money. Location great in small garden. Good menu and friendly service. Best to make a reservation. Tuna and good beef available. Thanks.

Le Jardin Bistro,40,typicaly french cuisine (comme a la maison),"you must book before to have the privilege to diner at the Garden, typical french home made cuisine, enjoy the cold & cheeses platters..."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,great venue and best value,"real good French food, a nice garden to enjoy your dinner or lunch in the busy Ho Chi Minh City ... price is really good and service is great. don't miss it"

Le Jardin Bistro,40,French cafe in HCMC,"Conveniently located off the street on the side of the French cultural centre. We were there slightly earlier than our 7pm reservation and the table was ready. English menu is available but the waiters English skills were limited. They do not seem to know what food items were still available in the kitchen and had to come back several times to advise us the escargot were finished. The frog legs and pork shank were left with one serving each.    We had to amend our orders several times. Also when we asked if the wine under promotion was French, the answer was affirmative. When it arrived, it was Australian. Please manage your expectations. Nice staff but be cautious of miscommunication.    However, the food was good. Starter, soup, main course and dessert averaged VND600k-700k. Good value for French cuisine in HCMC."

Le Jardin Bistro,50,"A little French cafe in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Our first taste of french food in Le Jardin, located next to the French school in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. It was a good change after days of local Vietnamese food. The cafe reminds One of many similar cafes in Paris and I would recommend the cold cuts which comes with lots of sliced baguette. The French owner hails from Nice and has been in Vietnam for over 14 years. Sample good ratatouille from his hometown. Food is really so great tasting that I forgot to take pictures of the duck confit and salmon with dill sauce ....."

Le Jardin Bistro,20,Missing flavour,"Booked for the garden area, was placed under a bright light near door, staff were happy to not care until I made them care. We sampled 6 dishes, wished we only ordered 2. The Tartare summed up the whole experience : under-seasoned, lacking flavour, not what you expect from the wonderful flavours of France."

Le Monde,50,Relaxing dinner at Cafe du Monde.,"Our party of 4 had a great dinner at Cafe du Monde. We enjoyed a cocktail at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender was friendly, prompt and the drinks were very good. We were seated by a window overlooking the waterfront. Each of our meals were very tasty. We did not feel rushed at dinner. We enjoyed our dinner and would recommend the Cafe du Monde."

Le Monde,50,Good food — good view,Wonderful breakfast with view of the river. Outstanding and friendly service. Server spoke fairly good English. They have an elevator if needed.

Le Monde,40,"Great setting, pleasant.","I booked last minute and was able to get a table for a Saturday morning with a window seat.  It seems like a busy, popular place so would recommend to book.    Setting and views were lovely and staff helpful with recommendations.    I had the French Toast & Mimosa and would recommend both.    Would go here again."

Le Monde,40,OK Experience,"Our experience was a bit mixed but more in part to the food choice. The restaurant itself has a lovely ambiance and we had a seat next to the window as requested. Starters were great - the squid and the soup . I had the black pudding which was lovely but my husband had the burger which was quite disappointing. The waitress - Julie - was amazing, a real powerhouse that the restaurant should be proud of. Really helpful and hardworking. Overall a good experience - but make the right food choice."

Le Monde,40,Excellent food - great service,This modern restaurant has a great location overlooking the St Lawrence. Service was very friendly and bilingual. Food was excellent- the best pork chops ever. Wine is expensive but that is so everywhere in Quebec.

Le Monde,50,Lovely Evening,"Our last night at Quebec and we had booked here. Caught an Uber as it has been a busy day even though the car only too, about 7 minutes.Cafe du Monde is down on the waterfront area upstairs with wonderful views along the boardwalk and river. We had a table up against the window. The restaurant is modern and feels classy. We ordered some cocktails and decided to try the seafood chowder as a starter and the fish and chips as a main.  We both found the chowder delicious and full of interesting fish pieces. The mains were also very good. Our server Sandy I think was excellent. The wine list is substantial and I enjoyed a glass of Gruner Veltliner which was savoury and complex. We shared the deep fried ice team as sweets. An excellent dining experience."

Le Monde,50,Great meal and river view,"We had a wonderful meal here. Our table overlooked the river and the service is very good. I had the grilled squid to start and then the salmon entree. Both were excellent. My husband had the chowder, which he loved, and he had the tomahawk pork chop which was so tender and flavorful. The wine selection is extensive. We will most definitely eat here again."

Le Monde,40,Good,Very nice spot for lunch. Beautiful view of port and St. Lawrence River. Good food and friendly service. Restaurant decor was modern and charming. My lobster roll was excellent the fish and chip was great.

Le Monde,50,Best meal in Quebec City!!,We visited based on a recommendation and were so happy we did.  Highly recommend making a reservation because it gets very busy.  Joanne was our server and service was fantastic despite a packed house.  The kid’s menu offers 3 options - salmon and pasta were generous sizes and the profiterole was tasty.  The duck confit was full of fresh ingredients and the duck was flavorful. The salmon plancha was perfectly cooked and accompanied by roast potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The homemade brownie was rich and moist.  Our best meal in Quebec City by far. Highly recommend despite it being off the main path.

Le Monde,50,Nice Waterfront Dining,"Dined here for lunch, outside, on a very pleasant afternoon. Restaurant is located waterfront at the cruise terminal - lovely views of the river, under cover. Restaurant is large and modern. Menu is large enough and includes some nice seafood dishes. Lobster and shrimp roll was quite good. Salmon poke bowl was also delicious. Service was very good. Not as inexpensive as the cafes in the historic areas, but the food was better!"

Le Monde,50,Superb,"Once again, another gem with waterfront views in Quebec City. Server was fantastic, really caring and telling us so much about QC. Food was great and what an ambiance. Thank you."

Le Monde,50,Lovely place by the water,"It was lovely and the look on the water makes it even more interesting. The breakfast menu was varied but although they mention gluten free options, I haven’t seen any."

Le Monde,50,"Delicious food, outstanding staff!","Great dining experience! Nice atmosphere with view of the St Lawrence. The staff are friendly snd attentive, Johanne warmly welcomed us to Quebec City and explained the menu in great detail. She was delightful and lots of fun. My Braised Quebec Beef Steak “a la bourguignonne""  was so delicious! And the phyllo wrapped ice cream dessert was a fabulous end to the meal! I hope to visit the city again in the summer months. I will definitely return to this lovely spot!!"

Le Monde,50,great service.,restaurant was great. waitress was friendly and helpful. Meal was excellent. the only issue was it seemed a little hard to find. Larger sign on the main street would be great!

Le Monde,20,"Amazing views, terrible food, great drinks","Nice server. Excellent view of the river and city across the water. Menu had English on it. The martini and beer were awesome. The food was awful. I would suggest going for drinks only. The bread (upon request) was hard and cold like you’d get from a cheap cafeteria and came with packaged butter cups which should have been the first red flag. The French soup was ok. The seafood soup (soup of the day) was good but not great. The Cornish hen was just ok. My flank steak was burned on the outside in several places. It was super fatty (I realize flank is a cheap cut but coming from the Midwest I’ve had nice flank steak) and just not good. The fries were limp and soggy. I had 4 bites and was done. Left hungry and ended up eating across the street at another establishment. For 2 soups, 2 entrees, and 3 drinks it was $130ish US dollars."

Le Monde,50,Unexpected find,"Only went here at lunchtime because our first choice was unexpectedly closed due to electrical problems. We were expecting a tourist rip-off scenario since it has beautiful river views and is right next to the cruise ship landing zone. Quite the opposite turned out to be the case - it appears to be overlooked by visitors heading straight for the old city tours and the prices are reasonable, not inflated. Best of all, everything we tried, both food and drink, was prepared and served with care and attention to detail, down to the side salads.  In fact it was so good that we dispensed with the idea of trying to find a different place for dinner on our one full day in town and returned later that evening. Not 'destination dining' perhaps but a kitchen capable of turning out a perfectly composed and prepared liver with pearl onions, parsnips, celery root, baby carrot and sweet potato with individual flavors intact. Note, we visited on a Thursday and it was pretty full at dinnertime (luckily we had reservations) so the experience could be different on weekends, we don't know."

Le Monde,50,Good restaurant for tourists and locals,"I made a reservation figuring it could be busy and it was.    Our first night after a long day of travelling I was looking for a good restaurant close to the Germain hotel, so I picked this restaurant, and I am so glad I did.    It is upstairs in the Port of Quebec cruise ship building and is easy to locate as it is well marked.    We had a reservation for six. The terrasse was full as it had a great view of the port.    We sat just inside but the view was good there also as it is all glass pretty well.    The service was excellent as well as the food and wine.    We would have gone back but it is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so the staff can rest.    This must be a fantastic restaurant as we noticed several birthday and special occasion meals being celebrated and they were all having a great time.    Try this place out you will not regret it."

Le Monde,40,Good tourist trap with very nice views,"Good tourist trap with very nice views. Seafood chowder was excellent, very creamy and tasty. Food was slightly above average but nothing special. Would recommend mainly for the locat6/experience."

Le Monde,40,Good experience with kids,"This was one of the few restaurants that actually let us sit outside with our kids. We had a lovely table on the deck. Our waitress was incredibly nice, even though there was a bit of a language barrier (my fault, not hers!). They were able to accommodate my request to have the tuna cooked well in the Nicoise salad. My husband got the duck salad and it was the definite winner of the meal. Absolutely delicious. I love the way the restaurants (particularly in this restaurant group) have very elevated and fun menus for the kids. Two of my kids had the chicken tenders that were delicious and a huge portion. But even better was the veggie app that was presented so fancy that it makes the kids feel really special. Kids meal also included a drink and dessert, which was a delicious profiterole. Overall, the food and service was great. The only thing to note is that there is a noisy bar below this restaurant. There was live music and we did not want to sit anywhere near the music because it was loud. It happened to be music we like, but if it wasn't it would be annoying. Just something to know about. Otherwise, the view is fantastic and it's just a lovely setup. Drinks were good, too."

Le Monde,50,Great Place - Went twice in our four day trip!,"Had a great lunch here, enjoyed it so much we returned for another lunch two days later. Service was so very friendly, the food was very good. Had the seafood chowder, fish and chips and the shrimp and scallops roll. All excellent. A beautiful setting overlooking the river, an easy walk from Old Quebec. Was sorry we didn't have a dinner meal open to try their dinner menu. Highly, highly recommend this restaurant."

Le Monde,40,Beautiful view and friendly service,We had a lovely meal looking out over the river and watching the sailboats. The food was very good and our server was incredibly friendly.

Le Monde,50,Loved this restaurant - water views too!,"We were pleasantly surprised at the food quality here. We thought this restaurant was better than some of the top expensive restaurants in town. With a reservation, you can’t beat the views. They’re a big sliding glass windows that open over the pool bar where there’s live music, and beautiful views of the river. We enjoyed excellent beef tartare, a delicious crispy cheese fondue, and excellent calamari grilled for appetizers. The chocolate melting cake and cheesecake are also excellent at the end. This was very reasonably priced"

Le Monde,50,Beautiful view,"This restaurant is huge, but better have a reservation as it was very busy the day we went for dinner. A lovely view, and food was excellent as well."

Le Monde,50,Wonderful Bistro,"We always come to this lively french bistro for Sunday brunch. The place is always busy and very well organized. The wait staff is professional and very friendly. Juices, coffee or tea, eggs, crepes, french toast, meats. cheeses, fruits, etc are all of the highest quality and prepared to perfection. Come for the food and the experience and you will not be disappointed."

Le Monde,50,Saint Lawrence would be proud,"The world needs more restaurants like Le Cafe du Monde!!!  It is ...can we say ... perfect  Yes...that's right.  I will describe why:  Excellent, perfectly executed French cuisine.  Fantastic, professional service.  Stunning views of the St Lawrence river  Completely reasonable prices  Outstanding wine list  Casual vibe with no rushing the customers  Very authentic French  Food so good that we had dinner and came right back for breakfast!!  ..it was so good I accidentally kept a memento 😎  Enjoy"

Le Monde,50,A refreshing option on the river,"After so many cozy meals in tucked away places in old Quebec we were glad our hotel recommended Cafe du Monde.    It’s off the beaten path next to the cruise terminal along the river. I imagine it’s a bustling place during cruise ship months, but on Christmas Day it was very calm with what seemed to be mostly Canadians.    We sat in the main dining area with a fine view of the icy St. Lawrence and enjoyed seeing families alongside us celebrating the holiday together.    Our server, Joann, was a delight. She gave us great tips and was attentive while also being discreet.    The breakfast poutine was decadent and delicious. Light crispy potato croquets instead of fries and hollandaise for gravy, along with a poached egg, sausage, bacon and ham. All washed down with a French Prosecco. Heaven.    Take a break from the crowded back streets and enjoy this riverside bistro!"

Le Monde,40,Very good food on the water,"The pate creme brûlée was very good as was the seafood soup. The soup was cream based with a bunch of seafood in it (not exactly clear what). Very filling. The pate was an interesting combination with burnt sugar on top, and was worth a try.  Fish and chip were pretty good. Not sure I would get them again.    Service was very attentive.    Nice place to sit in the afternoon and watch the world go by."

Le Monde,40,Great view!,We were here for brunch in mid November. The eggs Benny were perfect! We had a table with a view. The service was great. Highly recommend.

Le Monde,50,Great views..excellent food,"We just finished enjoying lunch here.  Located in lower town at the Port.  Watch the boats go in and out during your meal.  Service was excellent and safety measures were strongly in place.  The menu offers good choices for lunch. Fish and chips, burger, seafood stew and roast chicken.  Our choices were delicious and a good amount.  We actually shared a dessert which was the BEST dessert we had here, a maple syrup bread pudding. Heaven on Earth!  A really great spot. Super clean and classy environment too."

Le Monde,50,Sea food Stop!,First time in Quebec ! Incredible experience The ambiance is fantastic! The staff are friendly and the food is superb! Definitely recommend!

Le Monde,50,It’s wonderful to come here again!!,"We had lunch here and we were very happy to be here again, as the last time was in 2014.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and very courteous!!  She was very helpful in translating words on the menu that were unfamiliar.  We started with a beer, as we were a little warm from our walk to the restaurant from our hotel.  Our lunches were delicious, fresh and with a great presentation!!"

Le Monde,50,Excellent brunch,"This was our first time at this restaurant and we really liked it. We had the breakfast poutine and the Café du monde classic breakfast. Portions are very generous and everything was delicious (special mentions to the maple caramel waffle, the homemade strawberry jam and the ham effiloché). Coffee is excellent. We booked on the same day, got a table with a view on the water as requested. Service was good. We definitely would come back."

Le Monde,40,Guedille Homard Treat,"We had a very pleasant lunch at Cafe du Monde. It was such a pleasure being able to dine again, post Covid restrictions, in one of our favorite Quebec City restaurants. The view from their patio is spectacular. As always we couldn’t resist the Guedille Homard (Charlevoix-style lobster rolls) and craft draft beer. Our server Mylaine was very friendly and professional and happily accommodated our timeline. Our meals were excellent except for the soggy green salads. Will definitely return!"

Le Monde,50,Excellent Lunch - 28 Aug 2020,"At the quebec port while walking on the pier we saw this restaurant offering a terrace on the waterfront so we decided to try it for lunch. We didn't have any reservation but we were able to get a table outside. The menu is limited but does offer a variety of choices, we both took the burger gourmet. It was simply delicious and had a reasonable price. The view of the river and Levis was absolutely great. As for the service, it was very professional and friendly. The restaurant is well prepared for Covid since tables are properly separated and of course all staff are wearing masks.    Overall - Excellent and recommended."

Le Monde,20,"Lack of variety, did not meet expectations and disappointing","I’ll start by saying that the service was amazing and the location is good with free parking included.    The reason why I give 2 stars is because the food was mediocre and did not meet expectations at all. There were only 6 options for the main course, with only one vegetarian option. When we asked the waitress if there were any other options for vegetarians, she said unfortunately there was only the one option. The option is a black bean patty burger. It was okay but not worth the price.    My boyfriend ordered the veal liver and asked for it to be mediun-rare. When the plate arrived, it looked like cafeteria food thrown on the plate. The veal was well done.    We came here for a nice evening and walked out really disappointed. We had higher expectations and really regretted our choice of going here."

Le Monde,40,Good food. Great view.,"We had dinner here one night. Large restaurant, but with tables offering a great view of the water. Food was good. So was service"

Le Monde,50,Excellent place to Visit and eat,"I was there in the Sunday morning, nice place excellent views of the river Nice food and options, The cafe du Monde have international food options"

Le Monde,40,What a wonderful lunch! We,"What a wonderful lunch! We stopped in by chance and couldn’t have been happier. We had the specials and what a treat. The tomato soup was delicious and the poached egg was excellent. The egg has a red wine sauce that paired excellently. The walleye was perfectly cooked and perfectly paired in the plate. The other special was a chicken, spinach, and mushroom cannelloni with a béchamel sauce. So good!!!"

Le Monde,40,Great Breakfast,"We had fermiere which was a duck, leak and poached egg served over roasted potatoes. Food and service are both good. Nice view of the river. This restaurant is walkable from Old Town."

Le Monde,50,AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE,"I'm really like this restaurant, I'm really love it, the waiter that I had was very polite and really nice, he always watching what need us, and the food was excellent and very delicious, obviously would go again"

Le Monde,40,Good menu,"We were there to celebrate a birthday and the staff were very attentive to our needs. Selection of food was good but the quality was hit and miss. The duck, bavette, and liver were all great. Starters of fried calamari were delicious. The French onion soup was disappointing. Desserts were all delicious!"

Le Monde,20,The hype is unjustified,"Le Cafe du Monde’s premises are nice and service was acceptable, but our meals were sub-par.  The restaurant is situated on the waterfront with great views, and given the quality of the food, we would have to guess that the restaurant’s location is its main draw.  Among other things, the chowder was tasteless, the fish and fries (no, fries are not chips) was actually cool, and the flan had little flavor. Even the drinks were lackluster."

Le Monde,50,A life saver...,"Located right by the Pier in Old Quebec, this place was a life saver. We had to wait a few hours before embarkation and needed a place to eat. Cafe du Monde was the perfect place. They were very busy, but, we waited and had a great meal, excellent service and reasonable prices.  Everybody there was very helpful, and the waiting time was not too bad.  Lovely view from there."

Le Monde,50,our favorite dining experience in QC!!,"Not sure why this place is not rated higher. The steaks are fresh fresh fresh!! Grass fed, very tender and you can tell the quality is high! Service was outstanding (nice older gentleman with impeccable manners!). Wine list is extensive and suitable for every dish to accompany. Best of all, THE VIEW !!! You come to Quebec City, might as well sit where you can see the beautiful view!! Cannot wait to return!"

Le Monde,40,Waterfront Restaurant near the Cruise Terminal,"This restaurant was a nice find near the Port. The restaurant is on the second floor with a beautiful view of the St. Lawrence River. We were sat near the windows at a nice round table. We started with some appetizers to share at the table; boudin noir which is blood pudding, veal liver and cod fish and chips. I had the burger on a lettuce leaf instead of the traditional bread with a nice salad. My main dish was nice. The chef recommended a nice white and red wine for the table. The service was nice and knowledgeable. I was overall happy with the decision to come and eat here. I can imagine on a hot summer night walking along theWa boardwalk overlooking the water. We came in October there and was a small cruise boat at the Port."

Le Rivage,50,delicious meal at Le Rivage,One of our(wife and I)favorite restaurants in NYC. Lovely Gisele our hostess seated us warmly and always happy to see us(great memory as she remembers my fav vin blanc--Heritage--and fun times we had there.  We both started w/onion soup(best outside of Paris's Cafe de la Paix) and then duck a l'orange which was magnifique!!  Highest recommendation for Le Rivage!!!

Le Rivage,50,Fabulous French Food,Le Rivage never disappoints. The staff is warm and welcoming and attentive without being cloying. The food is consistently delicious. The ambience is charming. We never pass up an opportunity to dine there when in NYC.

Le Rivage,50,Great food and service,"Haven’t been in NYC in a couple of years. Had to re-visit this restaurant. Nice selection on the menu. Our appetizer and entries were delicious. Our waiter was very attentive and made excellent suggestions. Next time we are in the city, we will definitely return."

Le Rivage,30,Nice to check out if in area for a casual lunch meal but nothing special,"I went with a friend on a weekday during lunch time for the first time. We were the only table during that whole 2 1/2 hour time. That was a little disappointing and awkward but I guess maybe this place is more of a dinner and/or weekend place. Indoor dining smelled a bit old and stuffy but once a/c went full blast, it was fine. The waiter was attentive and chatty. The food is not fine dining which is what we knew but just thought place would be more popular as it was recommended by an acquaintance.  I didn't give it more than 3 stars because we found the food more on the saltier side. Escargot was ok but had better quality elsewhere. Bisque more watery than we like. Boeuf Bourguignon was nice as it had good cuts of meat but sauce a bit too salty. We did however enjoyed the chocolate molten cake. Portions on all dishes were decent. You do get a good value for you money on the prix fixe menu.  In general, everything was just ok and good to try at least once but nothing I would go back for. If I did go back, I would try the French onion soup burger that it is known for."

Le Rivage,40,Pre theater dinner,"Pre theater dinner  My wife and our aunt and uncle has been coming to this quail restaurant for decades. My aunt and uncle had known the owner and his son for at least that long.  My wife had decided to treat her staff ( and their significant others ) to a pre theater dinner prior to our broadway play. We had not been here for a few years and there was a lot of turnover in staff. The food however was still good. We all chose the price fix dinner which included an appetizer , main dish and dessert. There were about 15 of us seated at 2 tables Si I am uncertain about all the dishes. I had the onion soup which was very good, my wife chose the pate. One person chose the escargot. My main dish was the salmon my wife’s was the duck.Others had a steak dish. I had the cheese cake, some had crème boule.  There were no complaints !  For some it was the first time in a french restaurant"

Le Rivage,50,Amazing place like Jasmin said it would be!,Fabulous dinner! There was a large selection of choices I wanted to try. I order a small dish then a main course and both were exceptional! The young woman Jazmin encouraged us to try the restaurant as we were walking by. She told us we would love it and she was right! Thank you so much Jasmin. Diego was our waiter and he was so attentive and helpful on our choices! It was an amazing experience! The food is to die for and the service was unbelievable! Cheers I would definitely recommend it!

Le Rivage,50,Fabulous French Food & Ambiance!,"We had another fabulous dining experience at Le Rivage. Greeted warmly by the GM who checked on us periodically. We started with tender, delicious escargot. My steak frites was cooked perfectly. Other highlights were the Duck flambéd table side for added excitement & the famed onion soup burger. Our waiter, Diego, was super friendly & attentive. There was a wonderful jazz trio with a fantastic pianist which added to the wonderful ambiance. We will be back!"

Le Rivage,50,Amazing French restaurant,"I've been here once and all staff personnel treated me like King Charles from accidentally seeking a dinner restaurant when I was caught in the thunderstorm during my 5 days/4 night stay in NYC late June to early July 2023. I glanced at the dinner menu by the hostess who greeted me with a friendly smile. She informed what's good like a saleswoman selling her restaurant. I was walked to my solo table by another hostess. I asked if someone had an iPhone 11 charger as my battery was 10% and the hostess stated she has an iPhone so no worries to offer to charge my iPhone while I'm relaxing and enjoying the peace music by the pianist and the wonderful well trained staff at Le Rivage. The bus boy came along after 2 minutes which is excellent for just being witted down to read the French menu offerings. My waiter came out with my 3 course fixed meal which consisted of an appetizer/entree/and dessert for $70 bucks USD (for those foreigners visiting NYC). I ordered my speciality cocktail: Violette which was wicked STRONG by the bartender. Wow! I was planning on ordering round 2 of my Violette but I couldn't. 🤣👎 The bartender passed by my solo table seeing I'm trying to fan myself off as it's wicked humid outside plus thunderstorms so he went to turn the ac lower to allow me to cool off during my dinner. I was given upon my exiting the restaurant a business card plus a post card for my souvenir.    I would highly rated this French authentic cuisine 12 out of 10 stars for my review. I plan on visiting and having a delicious fabulous ambiance decor atmosphere with the staff having ""no attitude"" towards the customers.    Much appreciated to owner(s);to relay to your personnel to keep up the awesome customer service with a smiley face in each personnel i interacted with plus ****always good sign when your food items are delivered to your table the entree is smoking hot fresh off the oven or pan as the plate was still extremely hot touch it. Also, it's beautiful having the logo written on the plates ""Le Rivage"".    Best,  Charlie K.  Ckaoworldtraveler@yahoo.com"

Le Rivage,20,Will not be returning…,"We ordered from the price fix menu bc you must sit outside on Sunday in order to take advantage of the a la carte menu. I ordered the roasted beet salad with crème fraiche and mango vinaigrette. It was extraordinarily sweet, almost as if jelly were on it, and the beets were out of a can. I roast beets at home, and these were not roasted. The waitress gave me one without dressing which was worse. I then had the crispy skin salmon. The salmon was overcooked and the skin was not crispy. The Dijon mustard sauce was so salty it was practically inedible. There we’re two pitiful small round potatoes that were practically raw, and the stalks of the broccoli rab were so chewy I couldn’t eat it. My husband ordered the skirt steak smothered in some sort of thick sauce with a side of MacDonalds like French fries passing as crisp potato frittes. Very disappointing."

Le Rivage,50,A lucky find,"We stumbled across this place as it was near our hotel, tucked away between 9th Ave and Times Sq. Delicious food, lovely wine, extremely good service and all reasonably priced. So, the best ingredients for a great meal and setting."

Le Rivage,50,Authentic French. We dine here every time we're in NYC.,"All round perfect experience. We have been to Le Rivage several times, for lunch and dinner, and we have always been delighted. The lunch experience was especially wonderful. The French woman, who greeted us and served us, gave the elegant French touch to the experience, though the food and wine could have done it on their own. One meal and we were committed. We dine at Le Rivage every time we're in NYC."

Le Rivage,50,We have lunch here whenever we visit NYC,"The quality of food here is exceptional. We come to NYC 3 or 4 times a year from Boston and always have a lunch here. This time my wife had the ""onion soup"" burger, which is an excellent burger where the onions are not raw or fried but are the onions from onion soup. It is a great idea which works beautifully. I had the eggs benedict, which was perfect. In fact it exceeded expectations because the English muffin w as the most flavorful and delicious that I've ever had.    When you come in they automatically hand the the prix fix 3 course menu but we know to simply request the a la carte menu and that works better for us. Service cordial. Prices not a bargain but you get superior value for what you pay. Pleasant room with relaxing atmosphere."

Le Rivage,50,Authentic French Cuisine at The Heart of Restaurant Row,"Fantastic cuisine! Complex, multi-layered flavors; you can really taste the love and pride of the kitchen staff. The prix fixe menu has many options at a great value. This is our 3rd time here and I keep trying and loving new dishes. The customer-facing staff is wonderful too.  The jazz trio on weekends is the cherry on top."

Le Rivage,20,Can’t cook a steak properly,This place has the ambiance and menu of a French bistro. The 3 course pre theater menu was a good deal and offered many options. Drink order was slow to arrive and was at the table the same time as the starter. The starters of escargot and romaine salad were good. Main of trout was good but the fillet mignon that we payed an extra $15 for was initially blue rather than medium rare. It was sent back and the same steak was delivered medium well. Deserts of crème brûlée and molten chocolate cake were good. Something in the dinner did not sit well with me and I had to leave the theater because I was sick.

Le Rivage,30,ok i guess if you're going to a show,we weren't going to a show so i should have known better on this one - thinking from reviews etc it was a nice classic french restaurant - which it really wasnt. my steak was nothing special - service by the non french personel was OK. but all in all over $200 for a party of two definetly not worth it. if you're going to a show i guess you might like this place. but really nothing special at all.

Le Rivage,30,Meh!,Service: Good Value: Fine Food: Fine Atmosphere/Decor: Needs a major update. Outdated decor. Just okay. We wouldn't return.

Le Rivage,40,Good value!,1 1/2 blocks from Times Square. Decent service and good (not blow yours socks off) french food. Small but passable wine list.

Le Rivage,40,Not as good as previously,Le Rivage has a nice atmosphere and is relatively quiet. They offer a pre-show prix fixe menu with many choices. We didn't find the food to be as totally delicious as previously. Still a good place to eat before a show.

Le Rivage,20,None,"I agree with many of the previous reviews. The staff are terrific. The food not so much. As many have said the French onion soup is thin, bland and has very little cheese. I had the muscles. The broth had no flavor. Wanted to love this place but sad to say I won't return."

Le Rivage,50,Highly recommended,"A wonderful meal. We ordered from the restaurant week menu, and were pleasantly surprised by the generous portions compared to some other restaurant week offerings. Just the right size. Everything was good, and wait staff excellent. We will definitely recommend this to our friends."

Le Rivage,20,pre theater meal,"I was so disappointed with this restaurant.  The pre fixe menu was so pricey considering the offerings.    I spent $250. for 2 French onion soups that tasted like they were out of a can with a grocery store slice of swiss cheese somewhat melted on top. I ordered the burger because they say it's award winning and nothing else appealed to me. It's a simple burger on an English muffin. No big deal! The fries were cold, soggy and looked to have been the sorry leftovers of a previous batch. My son ordered the mussels and he enjoyed them but his fries were also not good. The desserts were ok, but I'm not much of a dessert person. The vibe of the restaurant was that they are past their prime and going through the motions. Overall, the cost to value was way out of proportion."

Le Rivage,50,Absolutely beautiful,"During our stay in nyc my partner and I walked by Le revage numerous times and didn’t think of going in, on our last night we decided to go in and we are so thankful we did! It was exactly what we both wanted and so beautiful and picturesque. The staff was very helpful and welcoming, the ambiance was great. It was such an intimate romantic evening with the dim lights and the gentleman singing Christmas songs on the piano. The food was amazing, very tasty. Quite expensive in all fairness but the quality was amazing so you definitely get what you pay for. This has been one of our favourite restaurants we have both visited and we would definitely recommend."

Le Rivage,20,"Pre-Theatre experience is ""Get In and Get Out!""","The ""About Us"" page at Le Rivage's website says: ""Le Rivage offers you a cozy, romantic French country atmosphere where traditional French cuisine is expertly prepared for your pleasure."" The food IS wonderful, but the atmosphere is busy cafeteria, neither cozy nor romantic, with waiters and bus staff constantly bumping diners at small tables packed together. Think I'm being too tough for a pre-theatre experience? When was the last time you saw a waiter asking a woman at a table who was waiting for her husband in the bathroom to return, to get up, clear out their belongings, and wait for him at the bar so that they could refresh the table for the next diners? The great food was no match for the experience. We won't be back."

Le Rivage,50,Tres Bien,"I booked this in advance having been underwhelmed by New York eating previously    I asked to be sat near the singer.  lovely atmosphere.  Loved the food and got quite tipsy in the G&T and wine  Snails, Duck and Peach tart yum! My best meal in the city,"

Le Rivage,30,Overpriced,"The wine was goid the food was ok, but the price was way to high for what we got. However, this is New York, and virtually on Times Square…"

Le Rivage,40,A pleasant Piano Bar restaurant with French Style cuisine,"Service very good and attentive. Food moderately good. Singing was entertaining, but voices not great."

Le Rivage,50,France on West 46 Street,"Le Rivage remains a value for excellent French food! From the escargot, among the best I’ve had anywhere, to the varied entre offerings from duck to salmon and trout almandine, the food is superbly prepared and served. Wines offerings are varied and well priced. And the deserts are very fine from  Chocolate mouse to fruit tarts are excellent. A fine place with tremendous ambiance- and not rushed even for pre-theatre!"

Le Rivage,50,Great Pre Theatre prix Fixe,"We had not been here in a while, but came here before a show for the pre theatre prix fixe. Tremendous choices for a pre fixe. We really enjoyed the baked mussels and seafood crepe for appetizers. The boeuf borguigon was very good,but the heritage pork chop was really outstanding. The NY cheesecake and the apple tarte were both very good. I highly recommend this restaurant for a great pre theatre meal."

Le Singe Vert,40,Relaxed vibe,"It’s more a bistro with three rooms upstairs than a hotel. The restaurant has a happy, relaxed and low key vibe. Not a tourist place at all but there is local things to try. It serves small dishes, not steaks or pots of mussels. A...More"

Le Singe Vert,50,Early evening drink and supper,"Very friendly and hospitable service, with very good tapas and wine. Would return! Especially liked th3 escargots profiteroles."

Le Singe Vert,20,Over rated! Expensive....,"Totally over rated! Expensive: bolognaise was 18 euro, came in a bowl with 2 pieces of french bread. No salad. The chorizo quiche was very small. Both dishes were tasty but for what you received it was very expensive."

Le Singe Vert,50,Go-to place in Dinant,"Excellent restaurant. Prices reflect the quality. Nice atmosphere, the staff and the owner were friendly and professional! Highly recommended"

Le Singe Vert,50,Nice mood ),"Very pleasant stuff and service, nice music, delicious HOT WHITE DOGS and best beers ! 100% recommended to visit ! Also hotel with clean and comfortable rooms"

Le Singe Vert,50,Good food and service,We stopped in Le Cerf Vert for dinner. We had the lasagna and a chicken quiche with drinks. All very reasonably priced. The food and the service were excellent.

Le Singe Vert,50,Cosy place with a great atmosphere!,Highly recommended to pass by this cosy place. Super kind staff that makes you feel super welcome. And don't get me started about the snacks...

Le Singe Vert,50,Great hot dog,Nice bistro - bit random menu wise. But the hot dog was super and I had a great time. Good Dinant biscuit and coffee. Felt like they’d want to add a bit to menu to cater for more people

Le Singe Vert,20,It’s not a cafe.,"Nice location, just by the river. But it’s a bistro, not a cafe. Come for the food, not for the coffee. They have no pastries."

Le Singe Vert,50,Very good,"Very good food, warm antique atmosphere and friendly staff. Quiche was fantastic and a vast beer selection. A must try when in Dinant 👌"

Le Singe Vert,20,Tapenade (only vegan option),"I went in, asked for the vegan option and got a locally made tapenade with some gluten free crackers, very nice but extremely expensive, that was 15 euros. I was expecting a meal for that price."

Le Singe Vert,10,The first “Restaurant” in Dinant on Tripadvisor is a Tapas place...that says it all.,The first “Restaurant” in Dinant on Tripadvisor is a Tapas place...that says it all. We went there looking for real food and we found....tapas.

Le Singe Vert,50,"SIMPLE, LOCAL, DELICIOUS, FRIENDLY","Small menu with local specialties, delicious quiches, tasty patés, the Dinant version of a hot dog.... friendly helpful staff and beautiful interior. Check the organic t-shirt collection as well, we went home with the Mayonnaise one ;)"

Le Singe Vert,50,Cosy atmosphere and delicious local products,Great selection of beers including unique local ones. Lovely local food and more than affordable prices. Highly recomended gem in Dinant.

Le Singe Vert,50,It just works.,"It doesn’t have to be the biggest, only the best in it’s class. Le CV is just that. Quality drinks with perfect food and great service. Need to see it to believe it. #uniqueexperience"

Le Singe Vert,50,Lovely spot in Dinant,"We spent a weekend in Dinant, and the Cerf Vert was the perfect starting point: clean spacious family room with a great view, perfectly situated at the river, a bar with cold and warm drinks on the ground floor, and fantastic service."

Le Singe Vert,50,Unique experience in dinant,"Great host who makes your visite to dinant unforgettable: fantastic place le cerf vert, very nice walk around in dinant and exclusive brocante shopping!"

Le Singe Vert,50,"Best coffee, great service","Beautiful authentic building, positive & welcoming vibe, great service and very childfriendly too. Best coffee in town!"

Le Singe Vert,50,Day Trip Dinant,"Beautiful authentic building , great people and delicious food. We sat on the terrace with the owner , enjoying a great glass of rosé wine."

Le Singe Vert,50,Must go!,Very nice place to have a drink. Very friendly people running the place. We heard that soon there will be guest rooms as well!

Le Singe Vert,50,All-new place for drinks & bite,"Lovely renovated and fresh interior, nice ‘boudin blanc’ sandwiches and great view of the river & monastery."

Le Singe Vert,50,Local colour café.,Great place to have a drink and a snack/ tapas served with a smile. Fabulous views over the river! Can’t wait for the B&B above the bar to open.

Le Singe Vert,50,Great place by the river,Beautifully renovated space right on the river in the city center. A refreshing alternative to the more classic and touristy places in the area. Definitely taste their boudin baguette that is to die for. I cannot wait for the rooms to open later this year.

Le Singe Vert,50,Cosy place with great food and drinks,"Great coffee and super tasty home made sandwiches! Together with an amazing staff, beautiful interior design and view to the river makes it a perfect place for a lunch or an evening drink. Definitely recommend!"

Le Singe Vert,50,"Good drinks, good food, good service","Freshly refurbished bar with a little terrace with a great view. They serve regional fingerfood and good drinks, with good music!"

Les Halles,50,Amazing French bakery in Epcot,"We came here twice to pick up something to snack on before we park hopped. Both times we got their Pissaladiere (Tomatoes, Olives and Gruyere Cheese pizza) $5.75, and once I picked up half a baguette $2.75. After eating so much heavy and fried theme park food, it was nice to just snack on a plain baguette.    With so many food options in Epcot, there was no time to try all the desserts here. We will have to come back."

Les Halles,40,Crazy queues,This is new since our last visits but it was great to find genuine french patisserie and snacks.  Was very busy each time we visited and there is not enough seating for the amount of customers but in good wather you can spill out in to the gardens and the rest of the park

Les Halles,30,Brunch,"We came here for breakfast on our first day in Epcot. We wanted to try a few things, so we got a ham & cheese sandwich, fraises tart, choc chip cookie & beignet. The sandwich and the cookie were really good, but wouldn't recommend the beignet.  The queue for the food was really long. We waited probably about 30 minutes. There was seating, but it was somewhat limited."

Les Halles,40,MORE TABLES,"Jeeze, why doesn't Epcot have anywhere to sit? This place has like 10 tiny cafe tables, and that's it. There's always 100 people in line. You do the math.  The Napoleon was excellent. The eclair was old, dry, and stale. The fruit tart was average.  If you can get in early, go for it, but if you have to skip this one, don't be too down."

Les Halles,10,Bad service and terrible management,"Service was terrible and self proclaimed manager/ owner was confrontational. I do not recommend nor will I ever go back, more to follow."

Les Halles,50,Amazing food,"We were planning to get just a plain baguette, we ended up with 2, and creme brulee, sandwich and other tasty stuff on top of this. All was very tasty and I would come back for more."

Les Halles,40,"Two pastries were bready and low quality, two were very good. Many choices","Les Halles offered a wide variety of pastry the one time my husband and I visited, but half of what we bought was low quality or stale. The Quiche Lorraine was great. The Duo at Chocolate was very good. Unfortunately the Beignet was bready , as was the Pain au Chocolate. We also had some Evian water. The seating in this French bakery is very limited and the lines are long. We were very fortunate to get an indoor table in this crowded bakery. There is no outdoor seating. When we eventually visit Disney World again, we will probably give Les Halles another try, but it is not a”must-visit” spot. We are able to buy better pastry in our hometown."

Les Halles,10,Waste of time and money,"We have have this sandwich many times before, the current ratio of bread to chicken, cheese, onion, tomato, and pesto is bizarre."

Les Halles,40,Good for 'quick service' although don't expect quick.,"When you arrive through the gift shop the line may appear long. It isn't yet. When it goes back all the way thru the gift shop, it is. From that point, expect a 40 minute+ wait. For dinner the food was good and reasonable. We had Croque Monsieur, the lobster bisque (tasty even without any sign of lobster and lukewarm) served in a bread bowl (bread was excellent), Quiche Florentine, the Duo, a Napoleon and a bottle of Perrier. Total was $42. Good sized portions and reasonable for WDW. Food was good, not great. Pastries were very good. Just wonder why they don't have an express queue for those just wanting pastry. No point in making them wait 40 minutes behind people wanting dinner. Still, a very good choice compared to other quick serve in Epcot."

Les Halles,50,Burst of Flavors,One of my favorite places to dine in Epcot. Counter service with Amazing Food. Pastries are Manufique! I go there every time I am in Epcot. I only hope it stays as good as it is now. Very Reasonable Prices.

Les Halles,40,Get there early,We got to Epcot for opening time and went directly to Les Halles in the France area. It wasn't particularly busy at that time. The line management is very good. When you get to the front you are allocated a server behind the counter and she walked along with me so I could choose my pastries. Good choice and very tasty. We went another day but later in the morning and it was rammed packed so we didn't stay. Only a small seating area and no seating directly outside but places to sit in the area if you look around.

Les Halles,20,"Fabulous food BUT overpriced, Understaffed, Not Enough Seating","Right After Ratatouille Attraction we raced over to Les Halles for a fix of authentic French Pastries. I looked forward to it for weeks (actually). BUT my experience was almost completely ruined by the one hour line we had to wait in to get our food, which was very expensive for breakfast. They are so understaffed for such a popular eatery, it has to be deliberate. Also the floor space in Les Halles is half occupied by stupid merchandise for the adjacent attrtaction. This left small children, elderly people etc with no place to sit. It all appears a ""cash-grab"" with little regard to the guests comfort or expereince which they are paying through the nose for. Its better to pick a much less popular stand like Morocco's Sweets, where they have pastries and sweets that can as easily pass for breakfast and coffee etc., and have no line."

Les Halles,30,Amazingly inefficient,"The queue to wait to order was unacceptable. We waited for over an hour. When we did get food, there is no place to sit. Mercenary family members are saving tables for food they don’t have in the small seating area.  The food is French fast food (if that is a thing). We enjoyed the Poulet au Pistou (chicken pesto) and the Croissant Jambon Fromage. The cheese plate was unique and we enjoyed with a baguette. The baguette is a value and they give you free butter but charge for jam. Prices are typical Disney-esque extortion."

Les Halles,20,Food is terrible and place has gone way down hill!,"Not sure what happened with this place but the food is terrible. Ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and it was nasty, tasted old and was rubbery. I was shocked because the quiche from here was not bad, however for the prices you pay at this place I would of expected better. I would skip this place since there are tons of better restaurants in Epcot."

Les Halles,50,An Interesting Disney Quick-Service,"I had heard of this quick service before, but I had never actually taken the time to eat there. When I was there a few days ago, however, I was quite suitably impressed. While the line was a bit crowded, the food was worth the wait. The ""Croque Monsieur"" sandwich was quite good. While I wouldn't mind there being more seating (the interior seating filled up quite fast), I found the atmosphere and food to be worth the time. In all, it was a good experience, and I will likely eat there again."

Les Halles,30,Food is good but .....,"Horrendous queue, crowded tables, people hovering for tables, this should be a great French experience, but instead its only real value is a place to chill for a few mins if you can get a table."

Les Halles,20,Underwhelming,"waited in a huge line that went very slow. The offers looked okay but nothing special. In the end, everything we got was underwhelming, totally standard, not worth the money."

Les Halles,40,No AP discount.,"Be aware that nowhere in France does AP discount that we’ve been to so far, bc they’re a third party sponsor. Meaning although on WDW property they’re not affiliated I guess. Pastry is as usual amazing and the Frose is too. Seating limited. Lines get long. But food is amazing. Got strawberry tarte, choc eclair, quiche."

Le Zinc,20,Uncompromising despite clear mistakes,"Overall ok. But even after repeating the waitress got our order incorrectly. The staff admitted the mistake but was unwilling to compensate us in any way for a meal that arrived as all others were finishing, fifteen minutes later. After a heated discussion I ended up getting nothing but a bad taste in our mouth."

Le Zinc,40,Lovely meal,"Visited on an evening whilst in Colmar for 3 days…. Hadn’t booked but went at 7 for opening and managed to get a nice table for 2 outside …  Good service the waiter, friendly and attentive with the right level of humour …  Food was good, snails to start and beef for me (cooked perfect) and fish for my wife.  Overall good solid meal and wine would deffo visit again"

Le Zinc,50,Great food and vibe.,"Was in Colmar for 3 days and went with my wife for Dinner. Too many restaurants have the exact same fair but this place was just different enough to catch our attention. Great service, waiter was fun and meal was delicious. Starter, main and desert - all good. Others around us also having a great meal so people were being social with others they didn’t know as well. Made for a fun night!"

Le Zinc,10,Stay away!,"A pleasant evening with friends on a trip had a less than pleasant ending. The food was OK but the people who worked there were arrogant, overlooked us, overworked, stressed and openly argued with each other. The man who worked behind the bar threw cutlery on the counter and shouted at colleagues. The food arrived late and many of us got food long before others. What we experienced was above all criticism. Do not visit this restaurant until you can read about the good service! As compensation, we received 2 bottles of wine for free, but we should have done otherwise. Better service would have been better."

Le Zinc,20,"Good food, terrible service.","Good food, terrible service. Good food, terrible service. Waited far to long to order, and even longer to be served, but the food was good."

Le Zinc,20,Poor management,"My husband and I took a day trip from Strasbourg to Colmar and opted to have lunch at Le Zinc. We were seated outside at a table next to the building. We each ordered chicken, salad, and French fries. I had no more than two or three bites of food when a wooden luncheon menu board that was propped on the windowsill above us was dislodged by the strong wind and fell onto the top of my head. My husband and the guests at the adjacent table called for ice, which a waitress brought in a towel. The proverbial goose egg swelled, and I kept the ice on and off for the next forty-five minutes. During that time I could not eat due to pain and nausea. Our waitress apologized and took my lunch off the bill as my husband demanded. I recognize accidents happen. That is part of life. My disgust is directed at the manager who neither came outside to inquire how I was, nor apologized when I confronted her when I was leaving about her lack of any concern when a customer was injured--no business acumen or customer regard!  Regarding the food, my husband said his meal was fine."

Le Zinc,40,Outstanding service; kitchen good but slightly uneven,"Let's start with the biggest positive, our service at this place, a young gentlemen was the kindest, most attentive we've had in many years. We immediately felt welcome; he was personal yet professional and did not only take our (sometimes extra-) wishes but also imnplemented them perfectly.  The kitchen was overall good but with some variation. The salad with goat cheese was wonderful, my flank steak was huge and optically nice but a bit chewy."

Le Zinc,40,"If you have couple of evenings in Colmar, worrh spending one here","We were looking for a fine place in Colmar to have some stake and we came across Zinc. Seated in the basement (not keen usually), we did enjoy a first evening culinar experiences in Colmar. Stake remained within average, but the starter foie grais saved the evening. If the company is appropriate, as it was in my case, the place is above average."

Le Zinc,40,A rainy evening in Colmar,Food was tasty and portions were big. Enterecote was perfect medium and meat was juicy. Tartar was nicely done from a perfect meat. The only remard we would give is staff was busy and stressful.

Le Zinc,50,Lovely dinner with family,"Can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed our dinner out. Food was great, steaks, fish and risotto, fries were great as was the veg and salads. Creme Brûlée for desert was stupendous. The lady serving was excellent despite our poor French and the restaurant having filled up quickly after 7pm. All in all highly recommended."

Le Zinc,50,Our best food experience in Colmar,"When in France, eat French. We were in Colmar in a little more than a week - and this was so good that we were there twice. The service is so nice and if you give them room, they will prevail, e.g. in the delicious wine selection for the meal. High-lights were the kids meat and the giant macaron, but everything here is tasty and well-prepared."

Le Zinc,10,Very unprofessional Staff and average food,"What was the worst and truely, the worst experience of our entire vacation, the server at this restaurant. She had no utter respect for customers and kept on making us feel unwelcome in every possible ways. She did so much eye rolling and mumbling that at one point I thought of telling her to go away and send someone else but then I did not want to spend rest of my evening fighting with someone who is so unprofessional in one thing they do for most of their day. She was so rude and unfriendly to us (as non-french speaking customers) that the restaurant should have a sign board for it. We even tried to use google translate to make the conversation less irritating for both parties but the arrogant server had the worst response to that.    Well, we ordered and the food arrived. It was average. Ambience is lively which is nothing specific to this place. It was same on the other side of street too.    My recommendation is not to go to this place at all if you do not speak French. There might be other staff who can behave normally with non-french speaking customers (who pay equal BTW) but If that is not your day, you will feel unwanted in so many ways that you’d wonder if you will have to pay for the food too."

Le Zinc,40,"Nice food, but service could be better","We really can't say anything bad about the food. Delicious and refined. And the welcome by the host was flawless too. Only the service at the table could be better. The waitress couldn't give us a wine list. In times of corona, we can understand why. But the answer we've got was very unfriendly and unexpected:  ""What would you like to drink white or red?"" phrased in a very unfriendly way. In the land of wine, even non-French people like to have a choice in the wine they drink."

Le Zinc,20,Over-priced poor food,"Ate here as it seemed a pleasant place. Nice location outside in the centre of Colmar. The service was fine. However the food was at best mediocre and certainly over-priced. I was served up the toughest steak I’ve ever had in my life, like trying to eat my way through leather. Served with pre-frozen chips and an au poivre sauce straight out of a jar. Quite disgusting. Don’t come here unless you’ve got strong teeth, better still avoid completely."

Le Zinc,10,Very unprofessional and not friendly staff,"I went to this establishment this evening and let me say it has been the down point in my vacation thus far. The server was unprofessional and rude making myself and my wife feel very uncomfortable and not wanted. We were criticized for not having a big meal and did not receive the basics like water and napkins. Avoid this place at all cost, much better establishments out there."

Le Zinc,50,"Exceptionally good food, needs patience","Food was just great, every single dish. Menu was in English so we could easily understand what we’re ordering, and the waitresses had good English. I guess good food takes time, because we had to wait 30-40 minutes for each dish, even the dessert."

Le Zinc,50,Excellent food,"We had dinner at this restaurant. Veel ribs with mushroom sauce was excellent, accompanying french fries was very good. Salad with goat cheese was also excellent. Service was also good. You may try if you visit Colmar."

Le Zinc,40,Food looked fantastic!!!,"Unfortunately, we arrived too late for food (the kitchen closes at 1400), but the plates we saw on tables looked amazing and left clean, so presumably tasted as good as they looked!"

Le Zinc,50,Excellent food,"We love going to Zinc. The seafood options are really good and their wine options are great too. Very good service. Le Risotto de St Jacques, L’Andouillette de Troyes are some of our favorites. Highly recommend this place!"

Le Zinc,50,Good food and service,I came in without a reservation and they found a table for me right away. The service was great and the food was good too. Highly recommended!

Le Zinc,40,Good Dinner,We went there without reservation and got a table for 2. Food and drinks were great and service was good too. The place looks nice.

Le Zinc,30,It’s fine,"Food was nice and setting is good. But still lacked a bit of something... While the steak was just ok, the chips were sensational. The scallops risotto was good."

Le Zinc,10,Terrible service!! Stay away!!,"What shall I say? Disaster!! Bad and slow service, no explanation, soooooo boring. Stay away if you dont have plenty of time."

Le Zinc,50,Fantastic place,"Good food, served by nice and friendly waiters. We had a amazing time here. Our meet perfectly fried, and the vegetables cooked with a bite. Our dessert was just as good. A perfect made creme brule. Everything was just in order."

Le Zinc,50,Delicious & friendly,"Delicious food, good wines & friendly staff! Fresh ingredienst, different kind of food and good timing. Cosy terrace!"

Le Zinc,20,Confusing,Went to have lunch at 2:15 and told food was no longer being served and then after dinner (9:30) went for a drink only to be told that they were only serving food and we couldn’t get a drink. Go figure!

Le Zinc,40,Great lunch,"Accidentally bumped into this lovely restaurant. Great 'Tete the veau', delicious wine and friendly staff."

Le Zinc,40,A very nice place to stay,Very typical Alsazian restaurant! Nice food and nice people. Very good risotto. A pleasant stop by in our Colmar trip.

Le Zinc,30,Average lunch,We had lunch here the first they we arrived in Colmar. We tried some local dishes and it was ok nothing more. The place is nice and service good and its right in the middle of the old town

Le Zinc,50,Excellent food in a pleasant atmosphere,"Great food, very nice and pleasant place in Colmar. A must go in Little Venice, you definitively must try the La Bavette"

Lucien,50,"Great Place to Eat, Drink and Be Merry","Although it looks like nothing from the outside, the interior has old world charm and character. Great and unique choices of food to eat, and our waiter Jamie was the best. He was attentive, helpful with our drink and food choices, and very accommodating."

Lucien,50,What a neighborhood joint should be,"Nothing more to say than covered in the headline. Except have a burger and by the time I left it felt like my local, not just a local. Amazing staff."

Lucien,40,Great fries and salad,We chose this place from the high reviews on multiple sources online. I ordered the burger with pear and Brie. It was good but not as good as I was expecting from all the reviews. The French fries were amazing though and the ranch dressing that came on the side with the salad was probably one of the best I’ve ever had.

Lucien,40,Great place for enjoyment for value,"What a great experience! Very friendly&helpful staff (Jeffrey). The soup of the day (roasted red pepper w chèvre,) was sublime, as were the scallops, the special burger, and the nachos. House made pecan pie on a house made crust was excellent with coffee. Fun atmosphere. Definitely will be back"

Lucien,50,Solo in the Byward market,"Last night in Ottawa for a conference, staying at nearby hotel, walked in a sat at the bar. Friendly staff, great selection of craft beers and wine by the glass. Ate a delicious chicken sandwich and sides. Affordable and good quality meal."

Lucien,50,Love,"Love this place great atmosphere, great service, food is awesome and service is game on. I recommended to my friends who were visiting Ottawa they loved."

Lucien,50,Excellent Ambiance - Friendly People,"A group of us were in town for a 'Men's Retreat Getaway' and we thoroughly enjoyed Ottawa. After lunch, we stopped in here for a drink and truly wished we come here for lunch. This is a great locals style bar with a bit of style and touch of French flair to it. There are lots of tables and a limited bar seating area. We were a group of 4 who wanted to sit at the bar and the other patrons were very quick in moving around to get us four bar seats together - very nice.    The beer selection is nice and they have a full bar. The bartender was also serving tables and was extremely busy, but that didn't stop her from being very personable and friendly. We looked at the menu and it looks terrific. We will be back for food. Overall, the atmosphere is very nice and relaxed and the people friendly."

Lucien,50,Words cannot properly explain…,"From start to finish, just excellent. First was service then was food then was final tab. I knew it was reasonable, but I just (as an accountant too) did not expect how reasonable my venture was.    Get the escargot and scallops, you won’t regret it!!    I cannot speak highly enough about the staff either. Just great!! (Between 5:30pm-ish and 8:30ish on a Saturday, 2/18), just a great crew!!"

Lucien,30,Burned Burger and Salsa-coated Wings,"This was my second visit here. This evening was an introduction to Chez Lucian for the other four in our party and I had nothing but high expectations for a fine dining experience.  Three of us had great meals. Two, on the other hand, did not. One had a hamburger that was charred. When this was pointed out to the server, she said ""that's how we cook it."" This however, does not explain why the other burger one of us had was completely un-charred.  The other meal was an order for mild wings which turned out to have a thin layer of salsa! That diner did not finish it, even after ordering some hot sauce to mask the salsa flavour.  I may come back to Chez Lucian though I don't know if the others will."

Lucien,50,"Great food, service and welcoming atmosphere!","My husband and I ate here on a recent trip to Ottawa and the food was really good! I had the burger with brie and pear. It was tasty, served with fresh cut fries and a really nice garden salad. Super service, friendly, casual atmosphere, and I loved the music they played (Simon and Garfunkel and Tom Petty). We'd definitely return!"

Lucien,50,Fantastic service and even better food. I had the Brie and pear burger.The texture of the burger was exceptional. Luv it,Fantastic service and food. Had the Brie and pear burger. EXCEPTIONAL! Not just your pressed filled with filler burger! Gotta eat here!

Lucien,10,Overcooked burger,"The burger was very overcooked.. honestly homemade burgers at home are much better. The fries were VERY good, like a much better version of McDonalds fries. However, both myself and one of my friends definitely got some food poisoning from lunch. Will not be returning."

Lucien,50,"Fabulous Burgers! Bacon, creamed cheese, mushrooms!!!!",Excellent food and service. Everything was super. If you want delicious food in a friendly setting this is for you. Had a very good Chez Lucien burger which is offered as an extremely generous platter with the very best shoestring type home made proper French fries and a very fresh salad with a Delish creamy garlic dressing.

Lucien,50,Unique pub in Ottawa,"In a city with too many pubs, this pub truly stands out. I have been here three times, and each visit has confirmed the exceptionality of Chez Lucien. Escargot, great; liver, awesome; gourmet burger, fantastic....next time will be the duck!  The original menu beckons one to experiment. This is casual dining at its best.  The jukebox is also quite cool."

Lucien,50,"Great food, service & atmosphere!","Had a lovely birthday dinner here. We tried the Chez Lucien and bourgeois burgers, served with fries and salad. Everyone loved their meal! The fries and salad were just as tasty as the burgers! We also enjoyed some great beer/cider options. Jeff was our server and made the experience even better, he was personable, had great recommendations and gave excellent service. I can’t wait to come back again!"

Lucien,40,Great Burgers,"Food and Service were first rate. I love hamburgers and it was delicious. The only problem was the noise, it got very loud and difficult to hear across the table."

Lucien,40,Great food!,"We experienced no wait on a Monday evening about 7 pm. Our server was very amiable and helpful, My husband chose the Lucien burger and I opted for Chicken Dijon. We both enjoyed our dinners and almost finished the generous servings. I was especially pleased with the vegetables that accompanied my meal."

Lucien,50,Ça vaut le détour!,I've been returning to Chez Lucien for at least 20 years. It's a great place full of ambiance from morning (for brunch) to night. The burger and the fries are excellent. The clientele is very diverse from young people to oldies which is delightful. The service is always excellent and most of the times one can be served in French too. It can be quite busy however on the weekend.

Lucien,40,Friends and Foods,"This placed was packed on a Saturday night and very loud with patrons enjoying conversation. If you like a selection of beer and burgers within an old historic pub vibe this is the place for you.    Burgers are unique and there is a nice selection of pasta. The mussels looked delicious. This is not a wheelchair friendly restaurant and bathrooms are in an old misty basement. So, come for the pub vibe and enjoy the burgers and beer."

Lucien,40,Disappointed,"Chez Lucien was definitely on our list, but our told 20 minute wait turned to close to an hour standing outside. We arrived about 7:30pm on a Thursday night. Obviously a popular restaurant and once inside, we could see why. We sat upstairs where we could people watch. Unfortunately, it was so popular and short staffed that the experience was not as hoped for. We both had burgers, which arrived after 45 minutes cold and dull. The fries were limp as cold ones are and the burger would have been fabulous if only warm. The waitress did check on how our dinner was and we said we were disappointed because they were cold. We were too hungry to not eat them. She did give us 50% off, but really, that seemed too easy and didn't make the meal better."

Marseille,50,Superb Fon,For excellent Bouillabaisse and Bourride that’s honest and true to tradition this is the place… not at all pretentious but superb quality fish in both dishes. The service was excellent and our server Tim was excellent and made excellent wine recommendations. In a town which is the temple of this Fon - surely this was one of our very best experiences. The harbor at nighttime is gorgeous and a wonderful stroll after dinner made this the perfect dinner in Marseille. Merci

Marseille,20,"Rude, arrogant service ruined what should have been a great experience, we were made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable","We came for the bouillabaisse, and the location as recommended by a great French friend and were so disappointed by the off-hand, rude, arrogant waitrers who ignored us, got the order wrong but didn’t feel the need to apologise and overall made what should have been a wonderful experience (albeit an expensive one) awkward and uncomfortable. Would not recommend this place unfortunately as a result."

Marseille,30,Not a restaurant guarding the high quality standard,"What a surprise and unfortunately a negative one.  We has great expectation, but we were disappointed. The croutons were blend and soft, the two kind of mayonnaise presented as aioli and a hot chili one has no flavor at all. The garlic used were not fresh - probably a left over from the day before. The fish in the bouillabaisse were presented to us as the one, we would have, but the plate with exactly the same fish were presented at the table next to us. All in all not the nice dinner we had expected, since the quality of the food was not applicable to the price range."

Marseille,50,Visit for the bouillabaisse,"We had a fantastic experience at Chez Fonfon. It is located on a little inlet which makes for beautiful views. We arrived without reservation, but they were very kind in accommodating us. The bouillabaisse is simply fantastic and the service was attentive."

Marseille,50,Lunch in Marseille,"We had such good time at Chez Fonfon. Dishes were sublime and the service prompt and kind. Definitely a restaurant to try if you want to have a taste of typical dishes of marseille. The view is also breathtaking. Because of the quality of the ingredients, service and the surroundings the prices are high, still I would recommend it."

Marseille,40,Service a bit hit or miss,"Our initial impressions were not particularly good. We found the maitre'd to be pretentious and unwilling to seat us at a window seat for the view. We were advised that window seats are reserved months in advance. When we made it clear that we had booked months in advance, we were swiftly allocated a decent window seat!    Of course we tried the bouillabaisse and we were not disappointed. The broth was full of flavour and the five pieces of accompanying fish were cooked perfectly. We also tried the fish soup which was excellent too.    Our waitress was wonderful, super friendly, helpful and surprisingly honest about which dishes to try. On the flip side. we did not like how the wine was served when we opted to try by the glass...the 'sommelier' basically brought us pre-filled glasses rather than pour the wine at our table.    So overall, service was a bit hit or miss but we thoroughly enjoyed the food."

Marseille,50,"Great location,stellar Bouillabaisse","Two of us had the Bouillabaisse. It was excellent although a different recipe than I have had elsewhere (less tomato in the broth and and flavor infused with spreads on bread added to the broth)    Other diners had the sole, which they enjoyed very much and was filleted table side which was great    Wine was excellent as well    The “translated menu” option available via the QR code could use some review by a native speaker as it made no sense to any English language speaker at the table (entrees were listed as “stuffed animals” “feet” and “aoli”). Luckily our server and the manager were able to explain. We were also puzzled by the fact that no shellfish other than mussels were available that day    Location is very cool as well. (Down a set of steep stairs to a hidden marina) If you have time before or after a drink outside along the marina is lovely."

Marseille,20,"Lovely location, terrible food",We sat outside in this beautiful spot by the sea. We didn’t realise it was part of restaurant chez fonton. Ordered a cheese and meat platter - it came in a small bowl and was very poor with only 4 small pieces of cheese and meat that was mainly fat. Very disappointing.

Marseille,40,Great bouillabaisse,"Great bouillabaisse, very nice service. Came from a recomendation for this dish and without reservation were still seated and served. The staff made a real effort to explain the dish to us."

Marseille,40,Bouillabaisse so good!,"Bouillabaisse did not disappoint. Not sure about the negative review of unfriendly and non-speaking English staff. We were greeted with a smile and asked if we need menu in English. Overall, a very good experience."

Marseille,10,Don’t bother patronising - awful service.,"I have never received such arrogant and awful service. I booked a table on the restaurant website but strangely did not receive a confirmation.  My husband and I didn’t think it would be problem because it was Tuesday lunch.  When we arrived at the restaurant, the waiter was very unfriendly. He could not find my reservation and he walked away to the kitchen, then came back and said I have to show him my confirmation on my phone. I told him politely that unfortunately I didn’t receive a confirmation.  He gave me the dirtiest look, walked away and told me to go away.  The restaurant wasn’t full. In many restaurants, the staff would say it wouldn’t be a problem.  Maybe things happen for a reason. We ended up in Perón down the road. We didn’t have a reservation and they welcomed us with open arms. The food and service at Perón was impeccable. Highly recommend Perón."

Marseille,20,Nice but massively overpriced,"A reasonably large group of us had booked primarily for the bouillabaisse . We nearly all chose it. It was a massive portion ( half would have been fine). A really good broth/boullion with about 5 large pieces of difference fish. All the fish was fresh but, as is often the case in a stew , not that distinguished. I think there is only so high such a dish can go and it is not £67/plate. At £35 ( a more standard price for the area) it would have been better (even if they had reduced the portion).  The other bits/accompaniments/desserts we had were mediocre.  The staff were fine but we only saw 2 waiting staff for the whole restaurant and not many in the kitchen. The signature dish is a fast one to serve. I suspect the owner is raking it in . I wouldn't go back because of the value. [I went to Nathan Outlaw in Port Issac last week and for £105 had six courses of different fish, all very different, all immaculately served - that was much better value]"

Marseille,40,An excellent restaurant to taste fresh fish and delish Mediterranean cuisine.,"A place to come for fresh taste of fish and good Mediterranean cuisine in Marseilles.    My husband and I had lunch here on a weekday. We made reservation online the same day.    The fish tartar, fish soup and grilled veal were all delicious. I particularly enjoyed my fish tartar (tartare de loup). It was well seasoning, and the editable flowers added the pleasure to the eyes.    The restaurant is a bit pricy, and 1 server is little cold, but it’s not a big deal since all ingredients are fresh and with the view of the old port, boats and the famous bridge, it’s all good. I will come back again whenever I am in Marseilles."

Marseille,50,Beautiful location and very tasty food,"Located on a beautiful old fisherman's bay and it is overlooking the bay! Excellent bouillabaisse including a variety of freshly caught fish, and very good service. it is a pity that the waiters do not speak English. A great meal."

Mercer Kitchen,50,Bar Tender Isso was a delight!,"We stopped at the Mercer Kitchen to have a couple of cocktails after a long day shopping, before we went to meet family for friends. We were lucky enough to be served by Isso who was super friendly (without being intrusive - hard balance to strike), helpful and happy. She really took care of us and gave us some top tips on cool New York fashion brands that our 14 year old son might be interested in! A lovely visit and we will definitely be back to sample some more of the delicious cocktails she made for us!"

Mercer Kitchen,30,Overrated and quite expensive. The food is nothing special.,"I had pizza Margherita, very thin, nothing special. it's a very expensive place considering the food."

Mercer Kitchen,30,Delusional,I went there a few years ago and it was amazing either the food as the service and atmosphere! Yesterday it was nothing but a freezing room with simple food and low choices in the menu…..sorry I heard it’s closing soon but it is for the best

Mercer Kitchen,40,Amazing service and good food,Amazing service you cannot find more attentive staff and mostly great food but maybe a little high on price having said that certainly worth a visit!

Mercer Kitchen,30,The Mercer Kitchen - overrated,"Good food but simple. Poor service! Freezing room! Too expensive. Not even a small cookie to the tea. No butter or Olive oil to the bread, only when you ask."

Mercer Kitchen,40,Soho legend,"Delicious food Maybe the best burger that I tried in NYC Good atmosphere, modern design and open kitchen. The bartender is fantastic and compensating the rest of the staff who are a little distracted"

Mercer Kitchen,40,Great location and food but Room for improvement on service,I come here all the time. Food is great and service generally perfect. But: the host responsible for given you the table is absolutely ridiculous and arrogant. I actually left although being offered a table.

Mercer Kitchen,20,Good food but very very poor service,We went to Mercer kitchen twice for lunch and each time the food and drinks were excellent but the service was horrible. They seem to take the order and forget about getting the food. In our case it took ages for the food to come and the guy sitting next to our table ordered the food and waited for an hour and the waitress came and was trying to convince him to cancel his order. Have never experienced such horrible service. The location is good right in the middle of Soho.

Mercer Kitchen,40,Excellent lunch gourmet pizza in SoHo,"Family day in SoHo and dropped in at the Mercer Kitchen for lunch.  We all had the gourmet pizzas, either with truffles or just plain margarita.  Perfect pizza bottom if you ask us. Toppings were great, both the plain and the truffles versions and service was friendly even though the initial reception was a bit cool."

Mercer Kitchen,20,Last visit ever,"Each time when in NY we used to eat at the Mercer Kitchen, we even tasted the one in Paris !  Well that’s the last time !  Bad service guess the waiter wasn’t speaking English most of the time another waiter came to push him or told him to do something !!!  The food was so so and the prices are really more expensive (I use to picture the menu!)"

Mercer Kitchen,10,Terrific!,"A truly very bad experience at The Mercer two days ago at dinner. We were a party of five and upon a total price of 600 usd we ate very bad with a no-service. My sirloin steak was (I swear) was 6cmX6cm height 1,5. My friend ordered a salad and he found only 3 (three) shrimps inside. In addition a tremendous noise downstairs (no soundproofing). Forget it! There is much better in NY"

Mercer Kitchen,20,Free falling,"Table booked for 9.45 PM 7 persons, arrived at 9.55 immediately informed that i 5 minutes kitchen would close (!!). Were we supposed to eat in 15 minutes?? Table wasn't the one requested. Ordered wine. Bottle not available. Changed. Bottle of white wine HOT! 10.45 end of meal. No desserts available. Sorry. Ok lets have a coffee. No spoons later brought to the table with the fingers. Was preassured with the cheque without having asked. Very disappointing experience. Have been going as a regular client to Mercer Kitchen for over five years. Will think twice before going back. They can definetly do better. Especially service. Free falling. Hey GM time to do somethjng??"

Mercer Kitchen,10,Spoilt our Christmas Day in NYC,"We originally booked JoJo's on 64th Street in NYC from the UK. We did alot of research and we were assured that the restaurant could cater for my gluten and dairy intolerances for our booking on Christmas Day. Unfortunately due to Covid our reservation was cancelled my this branch and we opted for Mercer Kitchen branch. We were assured in writing that this restaurant would receive my dietary requirements.  Oh little did we know! We arrived to find a soulless restaurant with little indication it was Christmas. Bread was brought out for my husband, I waited over 20 minutes to find out that no gluten free bread was available. I then had to watch my husband eat a very tasty starter that I couldn't eat as the prawns were coated in batter. They could not provide an alternative. I was incredibly hungry and upset. The mains were average. The icing on the cake was my desert - a couple of dollops of soya ice cream. We paid $120 dollars each, excluding the wine! Service was absolutely terrible, food mediocre and ambience zero. Such a shame as this was a special day for us - Christmas in NYC. We wrote to Jojo's on 26th December, no reply. I have contacted them again... I wait with baited breath."

Mercer Kitchen,50,Outstanding intimate and very cool,"We went to celebrate the 19th anniversary of our second date. (We've been married 18 years now.) We had booked outside but it was very cold, so they were quite accommodating about putting us inside. The drinks were great - although the white martini was a little small, the regular martini was quite full, and the negronis were excellent. We had excellent crispy calamari and a very creative green pea hummus with pita and crudites. The vibe was quite cool, and very intimate. I strongly recommend this place for anyone looking for a cool downtown place that doesn't cost a fortune and is quiet enough to hear your friends talk to you."

Mercer Kitchen,10,bad customer service,Good food but terrible customer service. The employees are rude and took long time to bring our orders. I’m staying at the Mercer Hotel therefore I always have breakfast there. it’s not a one time thing.

Mercer Kitchen,10,Don’t waste your time.,"This place is terrible. The staff are not attentive at all! The food was below average (the sausages I ordered came out cold), and the seating downstairs sucks (the bench is so deep that you have to be way above 6 feet to sit comfortably! I would pass on this place."

Mercer Kitchen,20,Staff do not care about your overall satisfaction,I went with my family for a special occasion. Party of 5. When we arrived I requested to be seated at the Main salon but was told that only tables of 4 or less could be seated there. I was directed to a separate area with bigger tables with no one there. We ended up having dinner alone in that area. I went to check out the main salon and there where at least 2 tables with more than 5 people and some available tables. I asked to be relocated and they came up with a list of excuses. When leaving there were still the same tables available. I talked to the manager and she said “well I am sorry you felt that way..”. The food used to be better. Service needs to improve. Couple of mistakes in our order. No good

Mercer Kitchen,10,Run don't walk away from this restaurant.,"Arrived for a 5 pm dinner reservation and was seated downstairs. After 25 minutes with NOT one server acknowledging my party of 4 we decided to leave.  The table of two next to us, left before our departure and the remaining table of 2 approached the bartender to request a server (they were also planning on leaving).  We watched a few staff members standing in another area (not sure what task they were completing), but clearly not providing any customer service."

Mercer Kitchen,40,Cristof is a master bartender,"We had a very nice time at The Mercer Kitchen. Ultimately we think it would have been better to sit upstairs or outside. Our bartender, Cristof, however made up for it by his excellent suggestions both of cocktails (he made some based on our stated preferences about liquors) and menu items. The coconut soup and the pea soup were both great. The Truffle pizza was also very good (I liked it more than Ryne).  If you go ask for a Bicycle or a New York Sour - if you like Whisky."

Mercer Kitchen,10,"Cool place, but bad service","I have heard many good things about this place, and i was looking forward to spend my Saturday night at this cool place with my friends. When we ordered the maincourses, three of us got the sirloin steak. I ordered mine as medium rare, but the waiter presented me a medium well steak. I told the waiter I ordered a medium rare and the waiter removed it fast. I was glad since i thought this was a good and correct service. But 1min after she came back a ""new"" steak and said it was a medium rare. IT was not a new steak, it was the exact same medium well steak. I complained and said it was not possible to make a new medium rare steak within one minute. I did not want a new steak since i didnt want to eat alone since my friends was already done with their steaks and pasta courses. The service was really bad."

Mercer Kitchen,50,"Beautiful room, an NYC must do","I visit every time I'm in Manhattan and have the same thing: half roast chicken, side fries. Sometimes I see a celeb. Sometimes I don't. I sit alone. Once I saw Beyonce outside."

Mercer Kitchen,30,Lunch Review,"Our experience at Mercer Kitchen began with a pleasant exchange with the reservationist. She took our temperatures, then seated us at a quite, albeit very isolated and cold table around the corner from the entrance. We ordered sparkling water, which they somehow ruined - it was practically still. We then ordered main courses - I got the vegan burger, and my friend got the mozzarella pizza. The service was surprisingly fast, but our food arrived lukewarm. It was not bad by any means, but the epitome of average. My friend’s pizza was pizza - nothing spectacular or unique. My burger was decidedly odd - the lentil based patty was fine, and the bread was good, but it was all covered in a strange, spicy sweet sauce. And no one seemed sure what the vegan cheese was made of (I asked multiple staff members). Overall, the restaurant was fine, but enormously over hyped. Our high expectations contributed to a disappointing experience, and we opted for dessert somewhere else."

Mercer Kitchen,30,A cold wind was blowing,"We had a table just next to the door, with every guest entering the cold wind was blowing in. Unfortunately we could not be moved elsewhere. The restaurant is nice and lively."

Mercer Kitchen,50,"Cozy, Intimate, Quality Restaurant","I love this restaurant. It was a perfect girls night spot, date night spot, family spot. Food variety is excellent, quality is excellent, service is excellent. I've been twice now, and will surely return. The lighting, seating, and ambiance creates an environment that is casual yet refined and perfectly matches the food."

Mercer Kitchen,20,The Bean counters have taken over,"I think the accountants have completely taken over. The prices are above average and the food is below average. Drinks are served in downsized glasses full of ice. Each food item is underwhelming and was served lukewarm. Squid was rubber, bread was cold, and the bass i had was meh. Good marks for the atmosphere and number of people working here, but unless your soho shopping bags are weighing you down, head to the w. village."

Mercer Kitchen,50,Very lovely meal!,"A very nice place, friendly staff and very good food, we started with the Salmon Sushi which was very tasty and then had the burger which was amazing. The place has a nice vibe, we sat upstairs where it was full of natural light and you could see the busy streets of NYC."

Mercer Kitchen,10,Totally disappointing,"I've dined solo at plenty of highly rated restaurants in NY and have never been disappointed until now. I'm not sure if it was the Sunday evening Restaurant week crowd or what, but to my mind that's not a sufficient excuse.    The initial impression on arrival was good, but I had to signal to order a pre dinner drink once seated and after 10 minutes had to remind another server.    I admit I ordered from the restaurant week menu but that shouldn't mean cheap substandard food.    The burrata appetiser was fine although it didnt need the bed of olive oil - the few bits of aragula were dripping, as we're the couple of walnuts.    The ""chicken milanese"" was what caused me to leave early - 2 thin pieces of crumbed fried chicken breast on a massive pile of vinegary aragula (couldn't find the potatoes). I've had far tastier crumbed chicken breasts in basic pubs in country Australia. I'm bit sure what pretentious excuse the kitchen might provide but it was pretty horrible, cheap and not at all ""modern American""    At least they had the decency not to charge more for it - although as it was part of a price fixe menu I then paid full price for the oily burrata.    Maybe this was an anomoly. Or maybe too many people are drinking to hipster cool aid. I only knkw Im not giving Mercer Kitchen another chance."

Mercer Kitchen,40,Lively atmosphere and good food - indifferent service,Large restaurant on the corner of Mercer Street with most seating downstairs below street level. The usual subdued lighting - lots of cellphone torches being used to read the menu - but a busy bar and good atmosphere . Food was good and well presented and you don’t expect it be cheap - it wasn’t - but watch out for the $11 sides - which when you are paying $34 for a main is over the top for a dish of mashed potato. Waiter Service was efficient but functional at best and the food came out almost too quickly. But overall despite the above it was an enjoyable experience .....and just closer to very good than average.

Mercer Kitchen,20,Less than good,Awful service. Waited forever for our food to be served and then my sons medium burger was almost raw. They offered to comp dessert and then charged us for it. I have never written a restaurant review on trip advisor but the service was awful and the food was really not that good.

Mercer Kitchen,50,Always trustworthy after all these years!,"We are having visitors from Europe over the Holidays so there has been quite a lot of dining out as per usual - We had planned something different and new for us and our friends but destiny wanted something else so we ended up at Mercer Kitchen - Just from the Start you knew it was going to be a great and memorable Brunch! The staff really are so courteous and friendly, knowledgeable with a constant smile on their faces - So good so I had to tell the Maitre'D! We had classic brunch, my friend that doesn't eat red meat had the Turkey Burger which was juicy and lovely, we went for the Eggs Benedict and a Delicious Bloody Mary! I haven't been here for years but so happy to learn that its still fabulous and delicious and a place you can take both friends and business associates! Bravo Mercer Kitchen!"

Mercer Kitchen,10,The very last disappointment of 2019,"We booked a table for two on New Year’s Eve to enjoy the last dinner of 2019, as this place was recommended to us for its service and amazing food by good friends, we were looking forward to it.    When we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess on the ground level did not even welcome us and quickly rushed us downstairs. Once downstairs, we were told our table was being cleared and it would take “just” a minute to get it ready for us. We were asked to wait at the bar.    The lower level was nicely decorated with silver and pearl balloons, and the lights were dimmed creating a nice atmosphere.    Fifteen minutes later we were given the option to either take two spots at a communal table on the lower level or take a normal table but upstairs which was not even decorated for New Year’s. We opted for the communal table as we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere.    There was some confusion with the degustation/set menu for New Year’s. We thought we had booked online for it but according to the hostess our booking did not show it. We let her know we wanted the degustation menu with its four courses and we did not want to order a la carte. She said it was fine but the set menu would only start to be served at 8pm so we would have to wait fifteen minutes aa it was 19:45.    While waiting for 8pm at the communal table, a youngish darker lady, with long black hair and wearing a long white dress asked if anyone at the communal table was having the set menu, we raised our hands. She said that we would not be having it as we did not book in advance. We explained the situation and told her that one of her colleagues had told us we would be having it and we just had to wait until 8pm. With a very snobby attitude, she said that was not right and implied it was too expensive as we would have to pay over US$200 each, which we were already aware of. That was very rude of here as we felt she was just trying to get rid of us tring to intimidate us with the price of the menu. She clearly does not know our lifestyle. She eventually left. We should have got her name, but she knows who she is.    Then another staff member came to confirm that we were having the set menu. Clearly there are big communication problems among them. By then, the communal table had turned out to be too noisy and casual for us, we asked to be moved to a proper single table, and since the only available tables were upstairs on the ground floor, we took it. That was a good move as a few minutes later a DJ started playing extremely loud Latino music and the tables on the ground floor became very attractive to people.    When we eventually started the set menu, we realised the mistake we had made. We should have left immediately as the issues started. The only course we really enjoyed was the truffled scallops which was delicious. Everything else was between ordinary to straight up disastrous. The burrata with lemon jam on top we could have made it at home, nothing special. The risotto was way overcooked with a German porridge consistency. The wagyu was almost raw when we asked for it medium well done. The passion fruit and meringue dessert was something you would see at a kids cooking class in primary school. We did not even want to take pictures of the dishes. Definitely not worth the ""over $200"".    Service was not good either. They would bring the next courses without clearing the old plates. They would take the cutlery and not bring new ones for the new course. Baffling, really.    We were hoping to have a great end of 2019, we ended up having the very last disappointment of the year. We will never be back."

Mercer Kitchen,30,"Meh, go for the fish",The fact that there were empty tables on a Saturday night should have been an indication but we had heard good things. My recommendation is to order the fish. Also the quinoa salad was very good. Everything else was either dry or bland. I had the steak. Don’t order it. It was like a $4 steak from shop rite. The salmon was delicious as was the Black Sea bass. They were expertly filleted and very tasty. The tagliatelle with basil pesto was dry. It rated a 5 on a scale of 1-10. So go for the fish or go somewhere else.

Mercer Kitchen,50,Always a treat !,"Always a treat , great good and ambience in the heart of SoHo:) Good service and ambience and presentation!"

Mercer Kitchen,30,Average and overhyped,"The room filled rapidly as we ate, so I guess it doesn’t matter what we experienced.  This was to be our treat during the recent visit to NY for our 3 generation group. Our overall impression was that the staff wanted us out of the restaurant as quickly as possible....  The food was average. I had the fish and chips...and could not detect any fish flavour. I was thankful for the interesting tartare sauce that lifted an otherwise dreary experience. The calamari starter came with a wierd chilli mayonnaise, rather than the sweet chilli sauce promised.... I could go on....  On a positive note, the restaurant has great design and manages to feel intimate."

Mercer Kitchen,50,"When in doubt, Mercer","Mercer Kitchen is always an unplanned delight. Great food and friendly efficient service, Mercer never disappoints."

Mercer Kitchen,50,Superb,"Se had thanksgiving dinner and it was spectacular. The turkey was perhaps one of the best ever!!!!! Well cooked, moist and the sides we excellent as well. Highly recommended."

Mercer Kitchen,40,Great restaurant in Soho,We went here on a Monday night. Reservations are a must because this restaurant was packed with a young professional crowd. The atmosphere is really cool with a rather simple menu. Everything we ordered was very good except the monkfish sauce was too salty. This is a restaurant you need to try in Soho

Mercer Kitchen,50,Always worth A New York Minute!,"I much enjoy my annual visit to the Mercer Kitchen.  It has a very appealing atmosphere and really delicious food.    The Waiters are professional and speedy.  Yesterday we were running a bit late in a cab and the charming manager, took our telephone call and saved our table until we arrived.  Such is the demand for this restaurant you really have to book particularly at the weekend.    There is a great menu, but I usually have the Mercer Burger, which is juicy and packed with flavour with very good extras including some finely chopped and cooked onion slices and some avocado.  It comes with a flower pot full of very good French Fries.    It is a buzzing place but not too noisy and would cater for any age group.  If I lived in New York I would bring friends and Godchildren alike to eat here.    It is a treat of a place.  A waiter refolded my friend’s napkin when she left the table.  A nice touch, I thought of good service!"

Mercer Kitchen,50,Really cool spot with great food!,"Really cool spot, great service, super drinks (and bartenders!), and delicious food! Variety of food choices-all we had was delicious! Nicneighborhood with really good shopping, too!"

Mercer Kitchen,40,Love this spot though needs a refresh,"The food and service are top notch! The physical space is, in parts, a little beat up! Our banquette had torn up covers and the edges of our table were marked. Need to refresh the furnishings. But these are minor quibbles. This is a consistently great place for business lunches or a spot to go when someone’s treating you!"

Mercer Kitchen,40,Nice place,We love the setting all dark and cozy.  Staff is nice and cocktails are good.  It’s a bit long to get the food but it’s ok if you’re not in a hurry.  My husband took the ribeye and it was big and good  I had sushi and it wasn’t awesome but nice  The desserts were not to our taste so we didn’t take one

Mercer Kitchen,40,"Nice meal and ""cool"" surroundings","Right in the middle of SOHO, the Mercer Kitchen was our choice after a day of exploring Governors island. The meals were very good. The service efficient. But overall nothing really special. The highlight of the meal was the side dish of Brussel sprouts (my family likes vegetables). The wine list was extensive but very pricey for what you get. And the experience felt a impersonal. As I said, ""nice meal"". But probably won't return any time soon."

Mercer Kitchen,50,Great,"Fantastic experience, We were there for a late lunch and it was recommended by friends. We had the Black Truffle Pizza and a Salmon Sushi. Best pizza in my life. Highly recommended"

Mercer Kitchen,50,"Great food and fun, knowledgeable bartender","We stopped in for a late lunch and some drinks during fashion week. It’s beautiful inside and a very cool vibe. Went downstairs and sat at the bar...I love it when a bartender is fun and is happy to see you! Our bartender was Andy Castillo-honestly one of the best I’ve seen in NYC. Made us great drinks, helped us pick some lunch selections, had a big smile and perfect service. The four of us really enjoyed ourselves and Andy made our experience fun and memorable. Absolutely will go back soon and highly recommended."

Mercer Kitchen,30,Disappointed all around,"We love dining out in NYC when we visit our two adult daughters who live there. Some of our favorites are The Dutch and ABC Kitchen. The Mercer Kitchen has been on our list of recommendations and we finally were able to try it recently. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment all around! It was 8:15 pm on a Wednesday evening so not exactly a full house of patrons, yet certainly not empty. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. It took a solid 20 minutes for anyone to even to acknowledge us and bring water to the table. It was an additional 15 minutes before we were approached for a drink order. Just short of an hour after arriving, we finally had a cocktail! Service did not get any better and the food was underwhelming at best. The hake was dry and over cooked. The salmon dish was fair at best. And, we had to ask the gentleman clearing our appetizer plates if he could let our waiter know we’d like a second round of cocktails! The one impressive item was the chocolate molten style dessert. Otherwise, it was very disappointing since we had heard good things about this restaurant.    However, the most notable and problematic concern I have for the restaurant is their hostess staff. While the women are mostly attractive and well dressed, a course in common etiquette may benefit the take away for customers! These are the first and last people you interact with and the impression is not favorable. While I am not a Manhattan or New York resident, I do travel extensively worldwide and I am quite familiar with high end dining and hospitality! New Yorkers like to believe they are too busy to be friendly or kind... when in fact it takes zero time or effort to be pleasant- particularly when you are in a very visual role for a business! Management may be well served to spend more time on training or be more selective in hiring!"

"Modern, The",50,"Ambience, bar, and kitchen coherence",This review refers to the Bar Room at The Modern. After a couple of slightly rusty visits shortly after the post Covid reopening their stride is back.

"Modern, The",50,Sensational meal with stunning food and great friendly service!,"A quick intro:  Promoted to a Michelin 2* since the last time I visited. The kitchen of this New York icon is currently under the helm of talented Chef Thomas Allen. At the tender age of only 22, Chef Allen ( who grew up in Canada! ) was a key member of the team that won the prestigious Bocuse d’Or USA cooking tournament in 2010 and placed 10th (out of 23) in the world during the subsequent final phase of this ‘World’s hardest chef competition‘ held in Lyon, France. He then went on to work under Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park, Thomas Keller at Per Se and finally onward to Paris and became sous chef at the 3* Le Meurice under Yannick Alléno.  Now, onto our meal:  For once, I am going to start off this review with a spoiler alert……..The meal at this 2* was splendid and dazzling!..... imbued with strings of visual and taste wow factors. Thoroughly enjoyable in every aspects, the ‘total package’ of food, wine, atmosphere, service and value trumped the Michelin 3* meal we had at Le Bernardin….hands down……except the bread service!  First, the arrival:  Our dedicated lady server ‘Hope’ kicked off our dining experience with the biggest of smiles and friendliest of welcome! We were seated in a bright, airy, high ceiling, glass enclosed dining room with a view of the outdoor garden. This resplendent and conspicuous space lifted our spirit and mood on a dull, wet and rainy day.  Next, the culinary adventure:  To create our own individual 4 course condensed luncheon tasting menu, the six of us combined to pick the following picturesque and sensational dishes:  Appetizer - Eggs on Eggs on Eggs  Caviar, Poached Egg Yolk, Egg Custard, Dill, Onion and  Toasted Brioche ( Wow!! Truly Amazing! One of my all  time favorite first-bites! Perfectly balanced texture and  taste! )  First Course - Chilled Lobster Salad with Kiwi and Buttermilk  ( Fresh and refreshing. Perfectly cooked lobster  nuggets )  - Sweet Corn Ravioli, glazed with Jamon Iberico and  Celtuce  ( A simple yet stunning creation. The creamy sweet  corn filling interacts with the savory, umami packed  Iberico Ham to create wonderful flavor sensation )  Main Course - Heritage Pork cooked pink, Black Truffle Marmalade  and Lovage  ( Perfectly cooked pieces of flavourful and juicy  meat. Bold and uber-delicious sauce )  - American Wagyu Ribeye with charred Eggplant,  Endives and Anchovy  ( What a gorgeous and generous piece of top-  notched steak! Cooked perfectly rare as requested.  Tender and full of flavor. Sauce accompaniment  was complex and sublime. The addition of a touch  of chili-oil elevated the dish to another level…..a  stroke of genius! )  Dessert - Cookies and Cream  ( Wonderful flavor. Sadly, a touch on the overly-sweet  side. Otherwise exquisite! )  - Apple Beignet with Caramel and Spiced Wine  ( I love anything ‘Apple’ and this yummy dessert made  my day! Piping hot and addictive! The combo of  crunchy/chewy shell together with the gooey lava apple  filling…..so gooood! )  - Lemon Frozen Yoghurt with Mascarpone and sesame.  ( Artfully presente. Bright, fresh and refreshing. Delish! )  Wine - 2019 Sylvaner, Albert Boxler, Alsace  ( This is one of the reasons for my occasional dining at a  Michelin star establishment!. A rare encounter of a scarce  product. This wine came from a compact domain, the  winemaker practicing artisan precept and making classic  Alsace as complex as a great Burgundy! This was clearly  reflected in this great quality/price ratio wine.  - 2021 Gonzalez Bastia Naranjo, Valle de Maule, Chile  ( First time encountering this grape varietal used in this  Rose/Orange wine. Unique floral pattern and taste profile.  Paired surprisingly well with the pork! )  What a memorable and incredible dining experience! If my memory serves me correct, this meal was more stimulating, imaginative and enjoyable than the one I had, when the kitchen was under the helm of Gabriel Kreuther. Apart from the food, the great, attentive service by our vivacious lady-server ‘ Hope ‘ definitely contributed to our overall enjoyment!"

"Modern, The",50,A piece of duck can change your life,"My daughter is a foodie, and my husband is a level 4 wine expert. We go to a lot of tastings and the best restaurants, where I have no appreciation beyond a good, stiff cosmo and great bread. This was not the case here. The Kitchen at the Modern creates an immersive experience that really lets you see a well-run kitchen make food into art. One huge standout was the perfect duck, and then the Chef showing my daughter hands-on in the kitchen how he prepared it. Chef Tom was gracious, friendly, and in control. He is grace in action. The evening was perfection in an imperfect world. Put this on your bucket list. I am making mine longer so that I can enjoy more experiences like this with family."

"Modern, The",30,Over value and unexceptional sadly..,"Great food( but not 2 stars Michelin) not very memorable, extremely small portions,service was good (but not very warm),decor cold and too minimalist for my taste, beautiful wine list, weir ambiance between the smell of fry food from the other dinning room and unisex washrooms. Unfortunately not a repeat place for us.."

"Modern, The",30,Not what we booked!,On a recent trip to New York we booked what was to be a special meal overlooking the sculpture garden. The restaurant was lovely and buzzing with atmosphere with every table taken. We mentioned that we had booked the Terrace however waiter said it had just been booked out for a special event. Really disappointed - food was great but this was secondary to location. The message this gives your customers is it’s all about the money not the customer. Very poor for a Michelin restaurant.

"Modern, The",50,Busy restaurant,"We had the most amazing experience at The Modern. Service and flavor of food, presentation was excellent. Dined off the pre fixe menu for my birthday which was hefty but well worth it. Had to make reservations a month out though."

"Modern, The",50,A lovely lunch during the holidays in December,"We had a fabulous meal at The Modern at the MOMA in NYC: 4 courses with wine! Well-deserving of its 2 Michelin stars⭐️⭐️ The dining room is sleek and modern with a view of the interior courtyard. The service was expected for a Michelin-star restaurant, and the food exceeded our expectations. The ""eggs on eggs on eggs"" dish was different and delicious, not to mention quite the presentation!"

"Modern, The",30,Lost its sparkle,"Having visited the Bar room in the Modern several times ofer the years I was keen to return for my first post-Covid visit - however it was very disappointing.    Service was sloppy - after being presented with drinks menus our waitress (who was very pleasant) then promptly disappeared for 15 mins. Meanwhile several other staff stood chatting on the sidelines and were oblivious to our need for service.    Worse was my wife’s chicken dish had to be returned because it was not cooked properly - it was noticeably pink. In fairness the restaurant didn’t charge for this dish and comped a glass of wine and desert for my wife, however my wife’s appetite was ruined (and so was our night).    Finally, a pet bug common with a few top New York restaurants - for some reason they insist on the temperature in the restaurant being absolutely freezing - I have no idea why they do this. Most other restaurants set their temperature at a pleasantly cool level. On mentioning to a waitress (as ours had again disappeared) I was offered a blanket in a slightly aloof manner.    I have many pleasant memories of the Modern but alas no more - I won’t be back."

Montparnasse,40,Great Sole Meuniere,"Service felt a little rushed by a mature server who seemed to be quite experienced. At other times, it seemed slow. A younger server helped, but they seemed definitely understaffed. The Sole Meuniere was great! Each course was nicely presented. Please be aware, as other reviewers have mentioned, of tipping. A 9% gratuity is included and is even stated at the bottom of the menu in ""tiny"" print. Our server failed to acknowledge the fact that it was included. He and another employee seemed deceptive when asked what was customary? They keep saying leave whatever you want for good service. Uncomfortable situation. In addition to the 9% we ended up leaving much more than we should have. So unprofessional for such a high quality/price establishment."

Montparnasse,40,"Great experience, but probably not worth repeating","Reserving via the site was relatively easy. Reception was excellent, the restaurant exudes exclusivity. It felt a bit strange that as a couple you were placed next to each other and not opposite each other.    The quality of the products is impeccable and very tasty, but you can expect that with those high prices. The service is a different story. It is only elderly gentlemen who serve, neatly and stylishly dressed. One is subdued, the other always looks for humor. In the long run it felt a bit theatrical and not really sincere. At our request, we were allowed to have a coffee and digestif outside on the terrace. We were asked twice whether we should run away before payment had been made. A comment like this once is not a problem, but if you travel twice, doubts arise.    Very, very strange was the fact that the waiter asked for a tip. We have never heard such a question in a French restaurant. Especially for a restaurant with such a good reputation and high standards, this is really a no done. Of course, a good tip is justified, but the way it is done leaves a bitter aftertaste and is the deciding factor in choosing another restaurant next time that is just as good, but more customer-oriented and does not excel by putting on a show. After tipping more than 10%, we didn't see anyone at our table anymore. Not to ask if we wanted anything else or to thank us for our presence and major contribution to their income.    It was a wonderful evening out, but one with an aftertaste."

Montparnasse,40,"Great food, service and atmosphere","Really nice. Frankly I forgot what I had because it was a week ago but all of our patty of 4 were very happy with the food, service and atmosphere. My only gripe was the waiter, in fluent English, alerted me that there was no service charge on the bill. It's quite common now in Europe to see a service charge where you never had that a decade ago. I gave him some euro, maybe 10 but that just felt like a shakedown of the Americans. I would still encourage people to dine here. You don't have to goose the waiter if you don't want to."

Montparnasse,30,Tip Scam,Presented credit card and waiter asked how much tip to add. They only do this to visitors from North America. Like any restaurant in Paris the service is included. They should have said do you want to include an additional tip on your credit card? Service was good so I didn’t complain but they way it presented was dishonest. Whole situation was unexpected and uncomfortable. Should not happen at a high end restaurant. Beware.

Montparnasse,50,Great place to dine at any time.,"Fantastic food, with a heavy emphasis on seafood. Wonderful, 'cosy', period interior and friendly, relaxed and cheerful service. I can't believe it has taken me so long to discover what I now consider to be one of the great Parisian restaurants."

Montparnasse,50,Wonderful! Great Food and Fantastic Staff,"Absolutely Wonderful! This place is fantastic. The food is great and the staff are the best and very helpful. If you like seafood, the Le Dome Platter is perfect. The millefeuille for dessert is an airy, delicious masterpiece."

Montparnasse,10,Refusing to cook for us,"Awful Experience.  We went for our post elopement ceremony. got appetizer and wine. Waiter did not come back for a while which we Didn’t mind but when he Did and we ordered….He said they wouldn’t cook for us as the chef said no. What a nightmare, Google stated it was open to midnight and they  Stop Taking orders Before 10pm??? Bizarre that the waiter couldn’t have told us we were about to miss the kitchen cut off. Felt extremely offended and disgusted ."

Montparnasse,50,Breakfast the French Way,"You are spoiled for choice of breakfast spots on the Blvd Montparnasse, with Le Dome, La Coupole, Le Select, and La Rotonde all within a few steps of each other. We chose Le Dome simply because its outdoor setting was so lovely. We chose the pre fixe breakfast menu: delicious coffee (everybody has good coffee, but they have *really* good coffee), steamed milk, flaky fresh-baked croissant, freshly squeezed orange juice, toasted baguette with butter and apricot preserves. The French way of breakfast is the best ..."

Montparnasse,40,Excellent Meal but Overcharged,"It was an excellent meal, very well presented. One server was very formal and wooden, the other was friendly and chatty. Well paced, delicious oysters (amazing nectar), and the other fish dishes (including a wonderful smoked salmon appetizer and scallops and Turbot in sauce) were cooked to perfection. An annoyance; two of us had a kir aperitif; my wife turned it down and said she would wait for wine. They brought us three. She sent it away, explaining again that she would wait for wine. The next day we noticed that they charged us for three. Caveat Emptor? I guess so, not sure it was accidental."

Montparnasse,50,A chic Parisian restaurant,"Wonderful experience at Le Dome in Paris. This resto is très chic. Delicious oysters, I tried a plateau decouverte. We liked very much menu Ernest. Attentive waiters, very pleasant and polite maître d’hôtel.  Thank you very much for having us there. We had a really great time!"

Montparnasse,40,Very good food- have the Napoleon for dessert!,"The food was very good! I specifically chose Le Dôme for the sole, as I have been in search of this dish since I first encountered it as a child in France many years ago. I just can’t find it near where I live. It was very good but not quite up to my expectations - only because I had a very specific expectation in mind. If it wasn’t for that, I probably would have thought it was perfect, to be honest. Everything else was fantastic. The decor is awesome - cozy and eclectic at the same time. It is very much a historic location - read up about it - such a neat experience. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and patient with us. I understand quite a bit of French but speak very kitty. My husband speaks and understands none at all - very obviously tourists, yet we were treated so graciously even though they were also very busy. Le Dôme was chosen as our one fancy meal of our trip and we were pleased. The house made Napoleon for dessert is a must have!"

Montparnasse,50,Perfect in every way!,"Le Dome is beyond good. It is every Paris dining dream come true. Beautiful setting, superb service, excellent selection of food and wine, and the most delicious food in Paris. We come here every time we are in Paris and we’ve never had anything but a perfect meal. Thanks to Quentin and Fatima for such excellent service!"

Montparnasse,10,Not an Exceptional Experience.,"This was the most disappointing experience of our most recent trip to Paris. Having dined at Le Dome many times over the years we were very disappointed in the experience. The food was terrific but the maitre d’ was obnoxious and rude to say the least. Upon arrival at 1900 hrs we were seated at the very rear of the restaurant, right by the kitchen. When we asked to be seated at another table we were told absolutely NO despite 90% of the tables being empty. Having made reservations on line weeks in advance I expected to be met with respect and expected to be accommodated since the restaurant was not busy……To me a fine restaurant not only serves exceptional food but makes the dining experience exceptional. This was not exceptional at all."

Montparnasse,40,Fish frenzy,"I hadn’t been to the Dome in a long time, definitely a couple of decades and it didn’t disappoint on the food front. The fish soup was great with I think lots of crab. The calamari risotto a highlight of my trip. A little disappointed to be sat in a corner of the terrace by the waiters station, with fairly constant shuffling of plates, despite booking at least 2 weeks before, but on the whole a memorable evening."

Montparnasse,50,A culinary treat with superb service!,"What a delightful lunch on 17 February seated at the window in the glassed atrium (l’espace brasserie) !    The soupe de poissons (with its croutons à l'ail & rouille maison) was excellent, as was the octopus (poulpe à la Provençale).    Equally noteworthy was the perfect and thoughtful service given us by Marc, the member of your service team assigned to the atrium on this cloudy Friday.    Having come to Paris to visit the Claude Monet - Joan Mitchell exhibition at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, we came to your restaurant to feel a hint of the artists' culture of the last century. We will come again!"

Montparnasse,50,The Dôme,Excellent food great host the waiter Cyril was exceptional with his attitude and quick response Best Mille feuille ever !

Montparnasse,50,Best seafood restaurant in Paris. Great staff and good service,"Had dinner with friends and all I can say is that the food is great, service is so professional yet friendly. Location of the restaurant is nice. Place tends to get busy so better make a reservation so that you’re sure to get a table"

Montparnasse,50,Exceptional food and service,"If you’re looking for a top notch, classic Paris dinner experience, then look no further! The food, service, and ambiance are all perfect! Don’t come here without trying the famous seafood tower!"

Montparnasse,50,Retirement trip,"This team along with the maitre’d and the most amazing chef made dining in Paris a highlight! Service, food, atmosphere were outstanding! If you are looking for a five star place to dine, then Le Dome is your place."

Montparnasse,50,Seafood in Paris for my 50th.,"Protien overload in a good way. We had the Dome seafood tower. Lots of oysters, shrimp, cockles, clams and crab. Wonderful service and ambiance."

Montparnasse,10,Terrible attitude,Not welcoming at all.. i asked if we can have some omlette for breakfast the person said for only lunching.... you have to watch your behaviours ... seeing partially eiffel will not save you if you go on not letting people in for drinking or etc

Montparnasse,40,Excellent Seafood Spot,"It’s on Bourdain’s list for a reason. Fantastic seafood, beautiful decor and a great location. Service was outstanding, they were very nice to my six year old daughter. And don’t skip dessert! They were fabulous."

Montparnasse,20,La Dome is only fabulous if you were Anthony Bourdain.,"On Oct 7 I booked a reservation for two for November 27 for 8 pm. Almost two months in advance.    Upon arrival at 8 pm. The Maitre D told me my reservation was for 9pm. I politely begged to differ, but he insisted he was correct until I showed him the confirmation of my reservation for 8.pm (I brought a copy). He “found” us a table. The waiter was borderline polite, until we ordered. When I ordered the Bouillabaisse, he told me to “pick something else. The bouillabaisse took 40 minutes. It was cooked fresh. The dover sole meunière was better. Pick something else” That is when I moved him into the rude category. Did he think we were going to dine in less than 40 minutes so they could turn the table? I ordered the lobster.    The food was ok, at best. The crab appetizer was divine. The tuna appetizer was bland, and the 60 euro 1 pound chick was overcooked.    The atmosphere and decor was everything an elegant french bistro should be. Reminiscent of days gone by. Until you went to the ladies room. The tiles were falling off of the walls and it was not pristine, as I would expect of such an establishment .    I could not believe that this was the La Dome Anthony Bourdain raved about. Dinner was two hours. I should have not let the waiter bully me into ordering something else. La Dome lost a good review, and I had a minimally satisfactory dinner."

Montparnasse,40,Good seafood experience,"Many years ago I visited brassiere part, what I still remember. This time we wanted to try restaurant part. We did not have a booking but we were very early and got seating. Very nice atmosphere (kind of well kept historical). Fast and friendly service. Nice seafood menu. My oysters selection was great and scallops with risotto as well.    But the top was this time mille feuille. Very special."

Montparnasse,30,interesting restaurant,Start was not so good. Looked at the menu outside but was seated in the brasserie area. As a result i was not able to order the dishes on the other menu. Not even simple ones. Main course was cod fish in a sort of broth with mussles. Interesting but not great. The desert with millefeuille however was the absolute best and almost worth the trip. Oysters were also good.

Montparnasse,30,Very disappointing,"Been eating far too much red meat recently (easily done when staying in Paris with Steak Frites ubiquitously available), so chose Le Dome in the hope of some delicious fish instead. My mistake. I started with the fish soup, which arrived tepid, with plenty of Croutons and Rouille, but no grated cheese. Followed by a very average Sole Meuniere (ordered with green beans, but served with pureed potatoes); and by the time they had exchanged the side dish, the sole was also only tepid. Bread was good. Service was fine. Total bill was 113 euros (for one) including a glass of reasonable white burgundy - far too much for the quality provided. We had a much better experience at Le Coupole (a few doors away) a couple of weeks earlier."

Montparnasse,50,Fabulous,"From the time you're greeted by the maitre'd who is hilarious, to the over the top foliage and decor, this place feels like old time fabulous dining. Everything is done on purpose and with flair. The seafood, and wine was superb and our lunch was elegant and we felt very spoilt. Lovely experience if youre looking for something old time Parisian."

Montparnasse,40,Fish is king,"Awesome location full of history. Fish is king here. And the millefeuille is emperor. Quality overall is from good to very-good, slightly overpriced for what you get. Recommended to impress and to be impressed."

Montparnasse,40,Merci beaucoup.... Le Dime!,"We had a wondrous time, our servicer was Valentine. He was perfect, very helpful and generous... to our needs & requests, thanks!"

Montparnasse,40,Good oysters🤤,Visited this place for a light lunch and the oyster rly satisfied us a lots. Mussels and mille-feuille were good as well. Would appreciate more if the service can be better lol.

Montparnasse,20,Valentine in Paris,"We had dinner at Le Dome on Saturday 22 February 2020. We were very much looking forward to having a nice experience but unfortunately it turned out to be very disappointing. We went there for their signature item, the Sole, but it was sold out. On a Saturday evening?!?! The wine was outrageously expensive, the green beans were cold and the service mediocre. The price-quality ratio value is ridiculously disproportionate. Do not recommend this place unless there is a 360 degres improvement."

Montparnasse,50,Great environment and perfect crême brulée,"Great environment and perfect place to eat 🇫🇷🥖☕️. I tried crême brulée. It was delicious! and my mom eat le Dome crepes, which is the specialty of the house."

Montparnasse,50,Excellent dinner.,"I had a fabulous dinner there last July, I found the service to be very good, professional and friendly and the food was truly exceptional. I will return and highly recommend."

Montparnasse,50,SEAFOOD,As they were not open - we made a booking with the front desk - the went across the road and had a couple of beers while waiting for Le Dome to open.

Montparnasse,40,Beautiful,"A beautiful venue, inside and out. A smiley waiter who was attentive throughout. During our visit Le Dome lacked the atmosphere of La Rotonde, opposite but seemed better suited for diners rather than drink and nibblers. I hear the shell fish is superb but I can only vouch for the drinks. Enjoy!"

Orsay,40,Old style charming restaurant,"This is a French old style restaurant, retaining the charm from American movies. The food was good without being exceptional. The services were good. It is also a restaurant recomnended by Michelin guide."

Orsay,20,Meh,"Asked for and got a quiet table. Points for that. Bread was ice cold in the middle. Try getting someone to replace it. Asked many of the employees who came by. None would even remove the cold bread. When waiter finally came back, told him, he merely said “ok”. HALF of the replacement was the same. Food was forgettable (sea bass), service crappy.    A place that doesn’t need to care"

Orsay,50,Un bistro authentique,"I dine at Orsay at least once a week. Monday is always prime rib night, and it's fantastic. The only problem is, it's too popular! They often run out unless you show up early. The rest of the menu, however, provides excellent alternatives. I especially recommend the duck, the sea bass, and the steak au poivre. Oysters are an excellent appetizer. The wine list is compact but especially well selected. For red wines, try the Moulin-a-Vent 2018, the Vacqueyras [Rhone], or the Chateau de Selve Graves. The apple tarte tartin is outstanding, especially when paired with their Calvados."

Orsay,10,"Overcharged for drinks I never ordered, then insulted me when I asked them to fix it","Very noisy. The food was just ok, not great. Dinner was cold. Menu is overpriced. They charged me for drinks I never ordered. When I raised it to their attention, the owner was pompous and arrogant and said ""maybe this is not the restaurant for you.""    This is supposed to be a high-end restaurant, the arrogant owner should be running a McDonalds."

Orsay,50,Classic French,"A lovely and leisurely meal. Wonderful escargot, very herbaceous but not overly garlicky. Steak au poivre was perfectly done and on the large size, enough for lunch tomorrow. Fries were crispy. Too stuffed for dessert. Love the high ceilings, the wood paneling and the overall atmosphere."

Orsay,40,A solid hit,"Dined here as part of a family outing. The venue had an elegant atmosphere, without feeling stiff or pretentious. I was impressed with the attentive and pleasant service, which made our stay quite comfortable, and at no point did we feel neglected. The food was enjoyable for the most part. I liked my duck confit, at least the thigh. I'm afraid some of the drumstick part was a bit dry, but perhaps that's just the way duck drumstick tends to be, it was never my favorite part of that bird. The beef bourguignon was tasty. I heard good things about the salmon and the sea bass, neither of which I had the chance to sample myself. I quite liked the charcuterie board starter, especially the pate that was part of it. Of the desserts, the apple tart was excellent and the chocolate mousse did not disappoint either. I could see myself coming back some time and ordering a fish dish. I thought the prices were quite reasonable for the quality. Overall I was happy with this family dining experience."

Orsay,40,"TripAdvisor does not have a rating for good, this restaurant is good.","We walked past this place on the way to JG Melon, the wait there was too long so we decided to walk back and were able to get a table straight away. It has an old school bistro vibe. I went with my sons, one just had the French onion soup and said it was amazing, the other son has a sort of tuna tartare starter and a burger for mains, we asked for medium rare, it was rare but he enjoyed it, the fries were perfect, light and crispy. I had duck it was ok, nothing special. I had a delicious glass of pinot noir. We went quite late in the evening, I'd imagine the ambience would be better earlier. I was pleased to find it."

Orsay,30,Bon Soir Paris,"A lovely French bistro on the Upper East Side with prices to match — $70 for two glasses of wine and a shared starter plate. Waiters were courteous even though we were only there for drinks. Judging from surrounding tables, this is a place where locals come for an elegant dinner that is like a culinary trip to Paris."

Orsay,30,Disappointing,This is an over rated restaurant. Escargot was salty. My bass overcooked. The vegetable sauté underneath bass was soggy and very salty. The mango and snapper crudo salad appetizer was very good but who puts corn on a salad in a French restaurant? The restaurant needs a make over. Service was spotty.

Orsay,10,Obnoxious maître d'at the Orsay Restaurant,"When you are greeted by a maitre d' with an attitude, it is hard to enjoy the rest of the meal, The food was ok, and our waiter was very nice. The heirloom tomato salad had tomatoes that were sliced so thin, you could see through them. Our waiter provided a substitute salad which was ok. The champagne was just borderline and tasted like it had been opened yesterday. We've eaten in over 50 restaurants in New York and this has to rate as one of the lowest,"

Orsay,10,don't bother!,"went there for my daughter's graduation and what a let down: the air conditioner was not working (on a very hot and humid day), the waiter was very rude, they didn't light all 4 candles on the cake (according to him they were not lighting: really? candles?...) service was BAD, the food was just OK. had fond memories of the place, hence our selection, but after this most recent visit, I would not go back. so disappointed."

Orsay,40,A French Bistrot as it should be,"Enjoyed this experience. Orsay is a brasserie à la française, with the bustling mood that comes with it. If you are feeling adventurous, go for the Steak Tartare and the Escargots. The desserts are good too. They do push you our early though."

Orsay,50,Best French Restaurant on the UES,"This is a true delight. The service is truly superb. I have come here over a hundred times and am always seated in the best table available, unlike those restaurants who will put. you in a dreadful table even if the restaurant is empty. I love the stead tartare and the Orsay Salad, but I can't think of a single dish that wasn't a pleasure. Also the wines by the glass are quite good, particularly the Carbernets."

Orsay,10,Absolutely not at this time,Absolutely skip this restaurant at this time  understandably things are not what they normally have been – nevertheless my most recent experience was extremely disappointing and expensive. Four of us went there for dinner the other night. Service does not exist – they have an extremely limited menu – and the food was tasteless and expensive. Complaints to a manager did not help in any way. Perhaps down the road in many months they could resume what we have come to expect of this restaurant.

Orsay,40,"A French bistro, even in Michelin Guide Rouge, on my walk of UES","Upon entry, I proudly showed my Michelin Guide Rouge to the manager. Orsay is in the 2020 print edition. He was not aware of this--it is part of the Michelin secret evaluations, apparently. He promptly whipped out his smartphone and took a couple of photos of the write up.    That was how my lunch started on that scented spring day of May 24. I had walked from the Guggenheim, ready for a Gaelic repast. Orsay did not disappoint.    I was shown a nice table on the terrace. As I swung into the chair, I quickly ordered Escargots De Bourgogne. Within minutes, the sizzling dish was placed in front of me. Taste tempting and just right.    For the salad, I enjoyed the Tricolor--light and breezy as that afternoon on Lexington Avenue.    The setting, service, the cuisine-- c'est si bon.    Take a page from Michelin and watch what happens."

Orsay,50,Classic and consistent,"I have visited Orsay for many years. The food is excellent, the prices not too bad, the outdoor sitting is enjoyable and the service is way above average. I will keep on coming."

Orsay,40,Always a great find,We have been here for many years and are always amazed by the great service and consistently good french bistro food. They have a perfect balcony and outdoor set up.

Orsay,30,JUST MISSES..............THIS TIME I KNOW WHY,"This restaurant always makes me react the same way but for different reasons. I'd like to give it 5 stars but there's always something and I generally can't put my finger on it. This time I can. NO MENUS. I'm a 78 year old man taking two women out for dinner (one 77, one 87) and we're being told to take out our mobile phones and take a picture of a square somethingorother and then read what comes up to decide what to order. Give me a break. I don't take my mobile phone with me when I go to dinner and I'm offended when people take theirs out and look at it. AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO IS OFFENDED BY THIS? I found the General Manager and he told me that they actually don't have menus.....so he fired up his I-pad and brought it to the table on a stand. What's next, will they be putting an I-pad in front of each diner so you can order online at the table and they can replace the waiters?"

Orsay,50,BEST STEAK! Amazing food for an amazing date night,"I’ve always wanted to go to Orsay and so happy they are surviving the pandemic.    Service was excellent and the food was top notch. I felt inclined to leave this review because I was perplexed by the poor reviews which I think are suspect.    We ordered a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers (French onion soup/ poached artichoke), steak, and dessert.    Pics added to prove what an amazing meal this was. Full flavor / Full experience! I’ll be going back."

Orsay,10,Don't order steak,"I ordered steak au poirv for $48. I got served a peace of the toughest, most sinewy and tasteless piece of meat that have gotten in any restaurant. Alongside as a bowl of some tasteless brown sauce with a few pepper corns thrown in. They should be ashamed"

Orsay,30,Not accommodating. Not at,"Not accommodating. Not at all. Granted it’s the pandemic, but they refused to add chicken to the salad. And they refused to make a burger with chicken even though chicken breast was on menu. And food quality was fair at best, particularly considering high prices."

Orsay,10,Rude unprofessional service,They ask tables to leave -while you’re still dining- if you’re there more than 1.5 hours. Even when their own waitress was the cause of delay. Won’t return.

Orsay,40,Just Short of Excellent,"Orsay has a lot going for it. It is pretty, The tables are very well spaced and the noise level is such that good conversation is easy. If only they paid real attention to the food, which can actually be quite good.    Their flaws are in the details. i have been there many times and always feel the same way. I recently ordered a cheese souffle. It was slightly overcooked and had fallen - it should not have come out of the kitchen that way, although it was quite good. It should have been served with a side salad, but instead it was just the souffle. MY companion had to send back a hamburger which was overcooked, but the final product was quite good. A salmon was perfect and delicious.    Unquestionably, it is the best restaurant in the immediate neighborhood."

Orsay,50,Belle Epoque Paris on the Upper East Side,"While Orsay has existed for only about 20 years, it looks as though it has been around since at least 1900, and has the feel of a Belle Epoque brasserie. I come here frequently -- sometimes for a meal or a snack, and sometimes just for a glass of wine. Orsay offers solid French bistro fare, with some more modern twists, such as a Japanese style tuna tartare. All of it is delicious. They have a good happy hour, which lasts until 8 pm, which is fairly unusual, as most happy hours end at about 7 pm. The staff is very friendly, and I really feel at home here."

Orsay,30,À condescending atmosphere,"We made a reservation and ask for a booth, preferably. Some of the guests arrived early and were directed to a round table. They declined and were waiting for a booth which they were told would be available soon. Fast forward: the remaining guests arrived on time and we had to wait 40 minutes to be seated...in a booth. The maître d’ then brought us 4 complimentary glasses of a sparkling beverage which he contemptuously and wrongly called Moët & Chandon. Trying to impress? Then the waitstaff announced the daily specials and omitted to mention that they had run out of the special main course, which of course is upsetting as it takes longer to look at the menu and make another selection. this restaurant is always full - a lot of regulars from the area- so there is no attention for the odd Guests. What a shame! It is such a beautiful brasserie. The managing staff is below standard."

Orsay,20,from good to bad,Went there one evening and had the evening special p-roastgbeef on a cart carved to order-great.  Could not wait to go back-tbhis time with friends 2 weeks later.  Everyythjin was overcooked or steak Tartar (clims to be great} was terrible  \/  To bad thought we had a new restaurant in our live

Orsay,40,Walked in for lunch without,Walked in for lunch without a reservation and they accommodated us. Exceptional service by the wait staff. Truly were thinking ahead of our needs and serving us. Mushroom soup was delightful. I would definitely go again. Prices seemed pretty reasonable for the quality of good and level of service.

Orsay,50,Excellent Thanksgiving Dinner,"At our corner, round table, we felt an intimate atmosphere and were treated like royalty. There were so many servers attending to us that we did not have to lift a finger. And the food! It was as good as, if not better than, my own Thanksgiving dinner. My entire family from my mother through my sister and me and our spouses, our kids, and our niece enjoyed the experience. They even accommodated the two vegans in our family as we requested vegan meals for them in advance. The only thing that was not great was the baguette - it was tough and dry. But the late afternoon was wonderful. We never felt rushed. It was lovely."

Orsay,50,Fabulous neighborhood spot!,What a great spot. This is very much a neighborhood restaurant and was highly recommended. They did not disappoint. The waitstaff was very attentive. I ordered the coc au vin- the broth was out of this world tasty - I hadn’t had this dish in years and Orsay’s version made me want to try making it again.

Orsay,20,So Many Problems,"I was bumped into over ten times in one evening, as servers and patrons tried to pass by the small space between my chair at table 59 and the servers' station. In addition, service was rushed and inattentive. We asked many times for gravy, for a salad (ordered as a share) to be split, dressing, sparkling water, plain water. At no time was a first request sufficient. At no time did any server come to our table to ask if everything was ok. I had to scoop my remaining salad onto my dinner plate since the main course was served before I was finished. We (all four of us) used to enjoy dining at Orsay. No more."

Orsay,50,Enjoyable,Nice lunch outside before cold weather arrives. Large choices. Friendly and professional staff. Sardines were the best this side of the pond. Reasonably priced wine selection.

Orsay,50,A Very Enjoyable Lunch,We were on the Upper East Side and stopped in for lunch. We each had a plate of escargot and we split a croque monsieur. What a nice lunch! The service was attentive and efficient.

Orsay,10,A missed opportunity,Orsay is an attractive and well located French bistro but sadly it just doesn't make it. In summer I love poached salmon with cucumber salad. I thought that was the perfect dish for them to serve. But it was awful and I never went back.

Orsay,50,Excellent Mother's Day outing,"On a difficult day restaurant service excelled. Great 7person round table removed from noise., Special Champagne deal with Bellini mix$42.00, and the Prime Rib was perfect and generous. Will be back."

Orsay,50,Top unformal lunch,Very confortable place even if the noise is so close to the french brasserie; a professionnal service with nice foods. rare in NYC ....

Paradou,50,Perfection,"Absolutely perfect. The set menu was totally delicious, the accompanying wine was spot on and the service was immaculate. All in the most beautiful bistro building. We ebiked over from St Remy and it really was the most perfect day. Will be heading back as soon as time allows."

Paradou,30,A Very Typical French Bistro,We were invited to join our friends and have lunch here. The restaurant is very popular and the sunny open area in front of the building was packed with diners. A word of warning! They only serve a set menu and the choices on offer may not appeal to everyone so it would be prudent to check what will be available when booking. The food was all right but very simple and the service was good. We are not sure that we will want to return too soon.

Paradou,50,Best Provencal bistro,"We had such a great meal with our Friend. We added to our meal some of the most delicious escargot we ever had. The menu that day was composed of egg plant salad, rabit and home made pasta, cheese plater and a selection of desserts. We took the meal with the wine and it was divine. We had such a fun and tasty time."

Paradou,50,Seasond regulars,"This is the ultimate French bistro. We have been eating here for the past 20 years. It has become more popular recently with visiting tourists, but the authenticity remains and the food is excellent. We cannot recommend it highly enough."

Paradou,50,Perfect!,"The most perfect restaurant and menu. Absolutely loved every minute. 5 Stars. A great location, easy parking."

Paradou,50,Spend time to enjoy one of the best meals of your trip to Provence.,Absolutely astounding. We stopped by after seeing the crowd on the front patio. Fortunately seats were available without reservations. The meal was price fixe with two main offerings. Veal and lamb. Our two hour lunch began with sausage and pistachio followed by our selection of lamb. My companion enjoyed her. wine selected by our wait staff. The best entree we have eaten during any of our trips to France.

Paradou,50,Fantastic evening.,"Perfect Provincial Restaurant. Went with friends on a hot summer evening. Yes it's not cheap and yes maybe they play the tourist card but that said we were greeted by very friendly staff and they continued to be all through the evening.  We couldn't decide if we wanted the traditional pistou soup or snails so the waiter give us the soup and a portion of snails to try. Both were delicious.  We had the lamb and it was succulent. Accompanied with delicious artichoke heart, sweet carrots/ onions and mashed potatoes. Then a enormous cheese platter arrived and left for as long as we needed it.  Rum babas and creme brulee for desert and we were in heaven. All this washed down with a few bottles of very good white wine and red for the cheese 🧀. Then coffee to finish a perfect evening.  I definitely would return in a heartbeat.  Loved it."

Paradou,50,Delicious and Fun,"The weather changed but despite the windy cooler night..nothing could dampen the fun dinner. soupe au Pistou, Chicken, cheeses dessert Wine and Cafe what could be better? An incredible dinner!. The house wine is very good. The dinner was excellent. The cheese selection was superb. The desserts were the icing on the cake. A traditional evening that should go on forever. A lovely kind group of servers. A return… definitely . A special evening as every day is special  ."

Paradou,50,"Not fine dining but an amazing restaurant nonetheless, Good quality food with a great atmosphere","Amazing place. Not fine dining but the quality of what you get is extraordinarily good. 4 courses of sheer pleasure and what an atmosphere. This was recommended by friends as well as Rick Stein. Price was set at 70 euros a head, and no choice here; but the price included their amazing bottles of house wine. Superb!! Its the ambience and atmosphere, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the young and friendly staff that make this place exceptional. Book weeks ahead as it is extremely busy and filly booked most days"

Paradou,50,Great place for a long lunch,"We were staying in St Remy and had been told that Bistro Paradou was worth visiting.  This place is great, staff were lovely, food and wine were great. The cheese plate is enormous- we barely scratched the surface.  The desserts were some of the best we had during our trip. the best Crème Brûlée.  What a great place to spend the afternoon.  Highly recommend"

Paradou,50,Provencal at its best,"This is a true local institution - grab a table outside and relax. There is only a set menu written on a blackboard and to have 4 courses plus unlimited wine is truly a gift at whatever the price! It was a great experience, especially as we'd just driven straight from Lyon and needed to be spoilt! EUR60 per head is pretty good, frankly. Bravo!"

Paradou,30,Busy spot in small village,"Crowded luncheon spot. Four course fixed prix . Salad is highlight as are desserts. Main course on Friday was fish, boiled egg , carrot and potato with local aioli sauce. All very typical of this region but not that good. Pricey at 70 euros. Great service and atmosphere"

Paradou,50,We will be back,Beautiful lunch great wine service and food rabbit with pancetta was moist Cheese Board overwhelming

Paradou,50,Is this the perfect country bistro?,This is a perfect place. Go at lunch. Sit outdoors under umbrella. Pick right day of week; they serve one appetizer and one main per day (or if picky one choice). But whatever you get will be magnificent country fare. Day we were there brilliant escargot and rabbit. Unlimited cheese. Do not skimp on dessert.

Paradou,50,Second Visit,"Our second visit to The Bistro and a few things had changed. Firstly it is clearly much busier/more popular, the clientele is more well-heeled and the outside terrace is the principal eating area (rather than the charming interior).    What has remained consistent is the fixed menu (apart fom the choice of desserts), the fabulous cheeseboard, the bottomlessness of the wine supply (and its quality) and the attentive and cheery service.    We ate on a Thursday - apparently aioli day. The main course was simply that, a feisty and pungent aioli accompanying roast cod, vegetables and a side dish of escargots. It looked appalling. It tasted great.    All other aspects of the meal were perfection itself and the atmosphere and ambience is second to none.    It was fabulous to sit in the sun and enjoy a chilled pastis whilst contemplating what was to come; it was marvellous and comment-worthy while it lasted, and now - a week or so afterwards - it has become utterly memorable. Can't wait until the next opportunity and will be ambassadorial until that point."

Paradou,10,Overpriced and underwhelming,"Underwhelming and poorly cooked local food.    We expected better but reality hit really hard. The establishment is clearly a place to be ‘seen’ rather than a place of good Provencal food. The menu of aioli with cod and vegetables was clearly lacking in both presentation and quality with undercooked vegetables and overbaked cod.    The dessert was so below the quality of the local McDonalds, a mass produced over sugared concoction that lacked flavour and identity, it was supposed to be a flottante not a sickly marshmallow surrounded by creme anglais.    The cheese board was expansive, spoiled by a lack of any fruit, dried or otherwise whilst the bread had been past its best two days ago.    Not recommended, much better elsewhere and €128 for two at lunchtime is outrageous."

Paradou,50,Glorious Dinner: Astonishingly Brilliant Food and Wonderful Atmosphere,"This is what you want when visiting Provence: food that reflects the local cuisine, made from clearly fresh ingredients, served by a charming and cheerful group who are attentive without being cloying--and a fabulous wine list. I would come here again (actually, I'd eat here three times a week if I could). Had the escargot (perfect), the chicken (a signature dish and deservedly so), and the marron glace dessert (looked as if itwould be too much and it was not...)."

Paradou,50,First Class,Superb French Cuisine. Amazing ownership and staff who truly understand cuisine and service. This restaurant is a destination and worth the time to get there.

Paradou,50,Worth visiting for the cheese board,"This is a well known place locally so expect busy evenings; the outside terrace ensures a good atmosphere each summer night. We were really pleased we went here.    The options are limited but freshly made and very tasty, with each meal focussed on the stunning cheese board. The lamb chops while small were great. My partner, veggie / Pesci, was also accompanied for with a vegetarian main of mashed potatoes, ratatouille and cooked vegetables.    For a causal meal out, this is a little on the expensive side but to make it worthwhile, would suggest going early, getting a taxi and taking advantage of unlimited wine, great food and atmosphere."

Paradou,50,"Wonderful meal, lovely surroundings","We had a fabulous meal here. The menu is fixed. Great food and wine, but my goodness don't order a bottle of fizzy water. The price is astronomic. They have jugs of water - go for that instead. Otherwise a lovely experience and great food."

Paradou,50,Kathryn,"Absolutely fab from start to finish, staff exceptional, food amazing! This was a real treat and the cheese board wow!"

Paradou,50,Top,Every here i stop here Nice atmosphere Nice people all kind of ..very friendly and fun Fix menu top quality All the best Carmine

Paradou,50,"Perfect terrace for lunch, good quality Provençal, great experience overall","Had lunch at the last minute at Le Bistro de Paradou on a hot summer’s day, outside on a beautiful shaded terrace. There was a set menu at €55 a head which included a roasted aubergine starter, a main of rabbit cooked with rosemary, all you can eat cheese from an expansive cheese board, and a dessert of your choice, plus bottomless wine (a bit dangerous). My partner was vegetarian and they were able to accommodate with a delicious ratatouille and artichoke main. The chosen dessert (mousse) was a bit lacklustre, but everything else was perfect and we had a great time so have to give five stars!"

Paradou,50,Lunch was fabulous!,My husband and I was visiting south of France and my daughter in law brought us there. We had roasted chicken with vegetable for lunch. The chicken was so delicious I wanted to go back again for more. We finished the meal with a wonderful assorted cheese plater. I highly recommend you book ahead of time because it's very busy!

Paradou,50,What a treat!,"From the moment you see the Bistro de Paradou you feel like you’re visiting a friend to have one of the most memorable meals you’ll never forget. From the family style tables to the incredibly delicious wine that flows freely you’ll enjoy a wonderfully comfortable atmosphere while dining on an incredible meal. Oh, and that cheeseboard!!!"

Paradou,50,Wonderful,"I thought I had already reviewed this as we were here in June and I enjoyed myself so much ! Looking back though I hadn't so better late than never ! We were staying at a little rental house around 150 yards away so figured we should try the place out. We were not disappointed! How they make what looks like simple food taste so amazing is beyond me !! I had the snails to start which were good but the chicken breast main was fabulous. As I said it looked basic .... a chicken breast , tagliatelle and some mushrooms . The taste was sublime ......the tagliatelle was mixed through with a truffle cream sauce and the chicken was so tasty. On top of that, great friendly service, great atmosphere and loads of wine . Ticks all the boxes for me !"

Paradou,50,Top-Notch Dining Experience in Provence,"Not only was the food terrific (soupe au pistou, roast chicken, pasta with morels, a huge selection of cheeses, fine deserts) but the entire ""package"" was memorable, especially the engaging, funny staff and the setting. It's also a good value. Go hungry, take your time, get into the vibe of the place, and you'll be amply rewarded."

Paradou,50,Favourite from way back.,"There is not a set menu at a set price (€50) but the food is still lovely and the service super friendly. We took some Aussie friends and that day, it happened to be rabbit. Disaster for Aussies with myxomatosis still withing memory.  They took it in good grace and even liked it! In oter words, you cannot go wrong with this place."

Paradou,50,Another excellent meal.,We have eaten here on each occasion we have visited the area. On this occasion we were able to eat outside even on a late September evening. Remains an excellent place to have a bistro meal in setting with a good buzz. Remains as good as before.

Paradou,50,A Provence Delight,"We went to this restaurant while exploring the countryside. Wow, what a find! The fixed price lunch, 55 Euros per person, included wine (it is a house wine, but very nice and all you care to imbibe), salad, main course, desert, and a cheese tray. The food was terrific and we really could not believe the food just kept arriving. We had the lamb option and it was tender, perfectly cooked, very tasty. The prosciutto salad actually could easily have been the meal. If you find yourself near Paradou, go, you won't be disappointed."

Paradou,50,Alan,My wife and I were here 18 years ago and it was fabulous. I have talked about this restaurant since then and we returned recently and I think it was even better this time! The food is excellent and the people and service were fantastic. It is truly a place to go and I hope I don’t have to wait this long to visit again

Paradou,40,A Traditional French Feast,"What a glorious evening spent under the spreading Plantan trees on the terrace of this great bistrot. We brought our US neighbors here to Paradou's best-known eatery which was aclaimed by Peter Mayle, the very British author of ""A Year in Provence."" Fixed price menu but with some very good choices!  Awesome cheese tray impressed our American friends as did our desert: ""Baba au Rhum"" where the waiter places a bottle of dark rum to enhance this delicious pasterie."

Paradou,50,'Aioli Friday' at the Michelin Le Bistro du Paradou. Wonderful Traditional French food,"We enjoyed the most incredible Provençal food today. Le Bistrot du Paradou in Paradou is something of a local institution and claims legendary status as the place for jovial, bistro-style cooking in the Alpilles area.    The late Charles Aznavour was reputed to have his favourite table; Princess Caroline of Monaco a regular. Also, featured in Peter Mayles' ""A Year in Provence.""    Our hosts planned and reserved our 'Aioli Friday' months before we arrived and happy to join the raucous, lunchtime crowd. Everything is served family-style, as it should be, and includes a starter, main course, cheese, choice of desserts, wine and coffee. We start with a heaping bowl of salad: savoury red and yellow tomatoes, anchovies, peppers and onions. Platters of potatoes, steamed snails in fennel, egg, cauliflower and carrots, arrive at the table — also, a full-on, garlic-rich, touch of heat, Aioli to pour over our plates. We, of course, could not resist the temptations of the fabulous local cheese board, (some 10+ choices) and a full dessert menu. Plus three bottles of red wine! Perhaps one of our best meals during our two-week visit."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,"Excellent food, but such a chatter.","The ham eggs and chips which all tree of us had were excellent, lovely thick English boiled ham and plenty of it.  There is a downside to the Bistro however.  The clientele is mostly senior and female, their husbands strategically retired to the golf course, shed or here after, the noise levels rival the local geese, not helped by the hard surfaces of the floor to ceiling glass windows, floor and walls. I had noise cancelling ear buds which I deployed, but they don't work. Dine outside if you can or maybe the veranda/conservatory has fewer hard surfaces.  The establishment is well named, but not I suspect with the irony that it turns out to have."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,"Amazing food, location and service","we were walking the coast path and found this place and what a find it was!!! Amazing lunch, best ploughmans ever!! Fantastic location and lovely staff. Dog friendly, we will definitely be back!!"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Great breakfast ( veggie friendly) great views!,"Excellent breakfast, great coffee and really beautiful surroundings. Worth taking a breakfast detour! Would generally give it 5 stars if your mostly mobile and we would definitely recommend the lovely food  ( veggie friendly too)  but would like to point out although it has ramps to get into and out of the cafe it has been made a lot less accessible due to the deep chippings in the carpark that make wheelchair access a bit of a headache.  If that’s not a problem for you it’s brilliant and the staff are friendly and helpful"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely find,Stumbled across this place when looking for somewhere for lunch during a family holiday. It did not disappoint. Amazing food in a lovely setting. Would definitely recommend.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Top notch Crab Linguine! Superb.,"One of my favourite dishes is a Crab Linguine and living locally I can tell you I have tried it at most of the restaurants in the area, including in St Ives and can tell you Birdies one tops the lot. Plenty of sauce, copious amounts of beautiful crab, a generous portion too, it’s perfect. We do love Birdies, it’s been wonderful watching it grow and expand over the years and it’s most certainly a hidden gem. Well worth a visit."

Park Terrace Bistro,30,"Ok food, very poor service",We popped in for a spot of lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was fairly empty with lots of staff/waitresses. Despite this it took ages to get served and trying to catch anyone’s eye was almost impossible. That said the food was eventually decent - we would have liked desert but couldn’t catch anyone’s eye to place an order so gave up and left (without leaving a tip) Shame.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Birdies for breakfast,"Arranged to meet up with friends for breakfast. Birdies open at 9, you cannot book. We arrived at 9.20 and inside it was busy already. I asked for a table outside, and we had a good table with great views. Service was speedy and efficient. I had the English breakfast and it was well cooked and hot. We ended up spending over two hours chatting and ordering more drinks. A lovely morning"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,"Birdies Bistro, Lelant. Well worth a visit","We went to Birdies this morning Sunday 17th September for breakfast. The quality of the food was exceptional, the staff were very friendly, and service excellent. We have been here before as we do live locally. Would recommend Birdies to everyone, and do.  We met Dom the owner, it was the 10th Anniversary of his opening the Bistro this weekend, and he has definitely worked very hard to create such a special place to visit.  Congratulations to Dom and all his very hard working staff. Here’s to the next 10 years.  Well done all.  Carol and Paul Douglass  PS We are not related to Dom in anyway."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Just perfect,Whilst on our holiday in St Ives last week we called here twice for coffee. The cafe is so nice with lovely seating indoor and out. Staff were very welcoming and friendly which was welcomed after a bad experience with rudeness at a cafe/cabin close by. We will definitely return and will tell our friends who visit the area regularly about this lovely bistro

Park Terrace Bistro,50,A breathe taking experience,Decided to go to Birdies for a breakfast with my friend.  I arrived a little early and made my way to the garden area.  Wow!! It is truly breath taking. I sat down at the comfortable table and chairs looking out at the estuary. The sun was shinning down and I actually felt quite emotional at the feeling I felt being there.  Never felt this before and just felt the need to leave a review as it only got better.    Being a parent of a child with allergies I was delighted to be asked if we had any allergies before the order was taken.    Such friendly and attentive staff. Our order came out and it was delicious. I love the tea pots too!!    Thank you Birdies for a delightful experience. Will definitely be coming again and my friend has now also sorted a date with her daughter to return as she was impressed too.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,"Amazing service, Great food","The people who run and work at Birdies Bistro have really got it nailed down! Great setting and location, lovely views, choice of dining indoor, outdoor, or outdoor under a canopy/cover. My Wife and I visited for breakfast/lunch, we were swiftly seated, served in good time, waiting staff were very friendly and welcoming, our dog was welcome and one staff member seen me tipping him water from a bottle and brought over a bowl for him which was beyond my expectation. The latte's were very good, the food was stunning, My Wife had a full cornish breakfast three times and I had a bacon focaccia twice and one full cornish on our last visit. Birdies prices were reasonable considering the great service, the location with great views, the value for money in amount served and the quality of their food, just spot on 3 out of 3 times we visited. Worth tipping every single time. Will be back next year for sure"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely visit,"In Cornwall on holiday poppedin on chance of a meal most other places in area not serving. We recieved a warm welcome and fabulous service throughout, lovely food in an incredible environment with RSPB MARSH just outside door. Can not fault service or food. Definitely recommend. MANY THANKS TO ALL STAFF THAT MADE OUR VISIT A PLEASURE."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Wonderful meal and atmosphere 😊,"Absolutely wonderful meal and atmosphere. We visited as a large family group and we all agreed that it was one of our favourite meals of our holiday. Can highly recommend the mackerel pate and my daughters went crazy for the crunchie ice cream sundae. Thank you so much to all the birdies team for a wonderful experience. We can’t wait to return. Birdies is set in a lovely location too, we love the views over the estuary."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,"Lovely food, location and staff!!!","Lovely location, lovely staff and most importantly lovely food! As two families holidaying together with kids under ten it can be difficult to find nice spacious places to eat, and meals all the kids enjoy. Everyone was very happy happen and we’ll be making this an annual visit!"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,busy but beautiful!,I thought ild leave a quick review for the team at birdies bistro. My wife and I popped in for breakfast yesterday morning. We luckily got a parking spot as a car pulled out and entered a very busy restaurant. Normally I would of tried another place after seeing this but the girl who met us at the door with a huge smile assured us that a getting a table wouldn't be a problem. Once seated another extremely friendly lady served us. our coffee was fantastic and the food was actually outstanding considering how busy they were! thank you.

Park Terrace Bistro,20,Gone down hill…,"Arrived for breakfast, staff were friendly. Having visited a few times before in the past and having the vegan breakfast which was very nice. Visited this week and it’s now a vegetarian breakfast which has had a price increase. Given the option to “ make me vegan” so take off the eggs. We weren’t offered any replacement for the 2 eggs but we’re still charged the same price. The prices have increased and the portions have got a lot smaller. The tomato and mushroom have changed to cheaper versions. I feel it’s not very good value for money and won’t be returning."

Park Terrace Bistro,20,Step away from the cake...,"My daughter is down visiting so we went to Birdies for breakfast yesterday. The Eggs Benedict she had was delicious as usual. I didn't fancy anything on the menu so opted for a coffee and a slice of carrot cake, which I expected to be lovely and moist, delicately flavoured, and covered with a lightly-sweetened creamcheese icing. Unfortunately for me, the slice I was served was as dry as a dusty old floorboard. The main ingredient seemed to be mixed spice which overpowered any flavour the cake might have had. The icing was over-the-top sickly sweet and seemed to be garnished with more mixed spice or cocoa powder, it's hard to tell which, as my teeth and taste buds were really struggling. I am renowned within my family for loving all manner of cakes and eagerly look forward to sampling a slice in most places we visit. But after 2 small bites I really couldn't eat the rest of this one, which is a measure of how awful it was. It has taught me a valuable lesson though - never order cake in a cafe famed for its breakfasts! Sorry Birdies, it's a No from me."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Fantastic,Just delightful. The staff were absolutely amazing. Very polite and extremely attentive . Food was delicious and the view was great. Not one bad word to say about anything at all

Park Terrace Bistro,30,It was OK,Popped in initially for a coffee and decided to book for  Dinner on another night.  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff . We ordered the mezze as a starter and this was nice and plenty for two. For our mains I ordered moules which were £17.50. There came with focaccia bread. The mussels were disappointing due to being small and gritty. The bread was also underwhelming and would have been better served as a chunk instead of 1 slices. My wife ordered the Dahl and she stated that it tasted nice.  As a comparison I had moules the night before in St Ives at the Sloop Inn and they were ace.  OK but only OK

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely food & service,"On our recent visit to Cornwall we had both breakfast and lunch at Birdies, food was really good service and location was perfect. We really enjoyed this bistro and would highly recommend."

Park Terrace Bistro,20,Don’t roll your eyes at customers,"Food was good, service was good except when we went to pay the bill, the lady on the till (American) rolled her eyes when we said we wanted to split our bill and kept tutting as she asked my 14 year old what he had and then wanted to charge him £35 I said no we want to split the bill between the adults and she raised her eye brows again. Bang went the tip!"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely views and food with the bonus of dogs being allowed inside and on the terrace,Popped in here for breakfast last Thursday with my friend and two dogs. Dogs are allowed inside as well as on the terrace. Lovely views across the estuary. Staff very welcoming and food excellent.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,"Great food, great place.","A good choice of breakfast items from light to full cornish; always love it no matter what I have! Quality ingredients, freshly cooked, plentiful and always consistently good throughout the 10 years i have been going. My favourite place for breakfast in the southwest and i go to the Hayle area just so I can eat there. Their Dog friendly welcome makes all the difference to me and the outdoor terrace overlooking the estuary makes a nice setting. Good views from inside in the winter too with a friendly team who always have time for you even when crazy busy."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,What a treat. Fabulous breakfast,"Had breakfast at Birdies over the weekend, and what a treat.  We all had something different  Bubble & speak with poached egg,  Waffles and bacon  Full Cornish breakfast  Eggs Benedict with added salmon  Can definitely recommend them all.  The weather was good, so we sat outside and enjoyed the view of Hayle Estuary.  Can't wait to visit again"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely surprise restaurant.,"Went to this place whilst our car was being serviced in Hayle. Larger than we expected and although we arrived as they opened, it soon got busy.  The service is friendly and efficient. The breakfast menu was very good with lots of choice.  The food and drinks themselves were very well presented and nicely done.  The view from the restaurant are stunning, over the estuary, with birds everywhere.  We will definitely go back."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Highly recommended,"Lovely food, consistently reliable. Staff efficient, attentive and friendly. Special mention of Sofia, the American (!)."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Perfect,Perfect food and service! Large meal and reasonably priced too Nothing else to say really. Would recommend.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Great service and delicious food,"We had lunch here today and it was fabulous. Although they were very busy the service was excellent and very friendly. I had a Ploughman’s which came with ham, cheese and a slice of delicious sausage roll and my husband had a fishfinger focaccia which he thoroughly enjoyed. We’re so pleased we decided to pop in and will be back very soon."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Don't miss it!,"Great food, great service, great setting and reasonably priced. We had lunch here and couldn't fault them. They have a varied menu and everything arrived as ordered, beautifully presented and freshly prepared. Definitely worth a visit...our only regret is we didn't discover it earlier on during our week in Cornwall.  Dog friendly too!"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Thoroughly enjoyable,"A planned call in after a (spectacular) SW Coast Path walk from St Ives.    Fully intended having just coffee and cake. The menu was so tempting that we stayed for lunch and wine. The mussels were up there with the best I've ever had. Plump, generous portion, and so tasty with fries and focaccia bread.    Caught the scenic train back to St Ives thoroughly satisfied, and full. Attentive and friendly staff, lovely relaxing view. Try and call on a sunny day.    Considering returning for breakfast on our last day. Do yourself a favour and just go."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Refreshments on SW coast path,Beautiful place! The staff were super friendly! We had stopped off for a quick drink whilst on the south west coast path. As we left we saw the camera!! So just had to take a cheeky one for our walk!! They were gorgeous! Thank you...More

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely food - lovely location - lovely people,"Lovely food in a beautiful location and the friendliest staff. Topped off a lovely day out, so glad we stopped there. Surrounded by couples and families all relaxed and enjoying the food and the pleasant atmosphere. The staff were a credit to the place, happy...More"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Coffee and cake with a view,A spotlessly clean and bright little cafe serving the most delicious flapjacks to go with good tea and coffee. The location is so pretty on the estuary and the staff are very pleasant. Would definitely recommend.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Breakfast,What a delight place and staff Fully recommend Eggs Benedict gorgeous and so flavorsome Very large car park and semiconductor views when tide in

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Lovely breakfast,"Visited with family for breakfast - not visited before but definitely will again! Great amount of choice, delicious breakfast perfectly cooked, staff friendly and amazing views. Would 100% recommend a visit if you are in the area, will return again to try the lunch menu!!"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Birdies The Word,"Hands down the best place to eat in the area Well run, friendly staff and food is always amazing (I have no idea how they get their eggs so perfect!!!) Brilliant Birthday Brunch thank you Birdies :-)"

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Family and dog friendly.,"Terrific location, lovely staff and great food. A choice of areas to sit indoors outdoors. Family and dog friendly. A menu to suit all tastes."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Birdies,"Excelllent excellent and excellent...the food, andservice were brilliant and enjoyable and the availability to take our dog in with us was an added bonus. Not our first visit but every time we go everything is the same the views are spectacular also."

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Excellent,Visited many times for breakfast and has always been excellent ! Best to arrive early as it gets very busy . Live locally and it’s our go to for breakfast out every time

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Best Crab Linguine in Cornwall,Birdies has expanded from the last time I was here. It is absolutely fantastic and the staff are so friendly and particularly kind to my Assistance Dog.

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Can’t wait to come again,Fantastic quality food it was a delicious lunch. I had a ham ploughman’s and husband had the Cornish breakfast both where excellent

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Great service and superb lunch,We visited today for lunch and we’re not disappointed. The service was great and the food was delicious. I had the bubble & squeak with sausage which was really tasty. The coffee and cakes afterwards were gorgeous

Park Terrace Bistro,50,Tasty Breakfast,Great Breakfast here .Very busy but service quick and food tasty.Our dog was made welcome also .We have often walked past here and commented on how busy it always looked and that we mist try it one day.So glad we did.

Pascalou,50,a gem for food and service,"Cozy ambiance, especially on the first floor. Food is above average for French restaurants in NYC, especially considering its reasonable prices. Service is quick and attentive."

Pascalou,50,A Little Gem,"The food was outstanding. Send it. Blueberry lemon pancakes were incredible. We also enjoyed the lamb chops, the French toast and the smoked salmon platter. Service was attentive and the staff could not have been nicer. It’s a lovely small and cozy place."

Pascalou,50,Well executed delicious food with a charming atmosphere,Delightful experience with exceptional food. Uncomplicated well executed dishes and reasonable accommodations for food sensitivities. Highly recommend.

Pascalou,30,Local bistro,Dinner was enjoyable. Service sporadic but friendly. Very busy so staff was busy. Food was good. Two of us enjoyed the lobster ravioli special.

Pascalou,50,Happy find,"Just happened to walk by and had lunch... excellent food and service. I suspect a smaller menu than 'normal'', but no complaints. Lovely place to enjoy a nice meal in peace. Definitely will cime back."

Pascalou,40,Cozy gem of a restaurant,"This cozy, lovely restaurant has a wonderfully fresh menu, with a great variety for both vegetarians and meat-lovers. I liked the Peking Duck, the baked brie, and the artichoke hearts, which my family and I shared. This restaurant is on the smaller side, even for an NYC restaurant, but our waitress was friendly and made us feel welcome. It's more of a neighborhood restaurant than a big ritzy place, which was great - this type of restaurant feels more welcoming and tries harder, as it relies more on its customers' good reviews than on fame."

Pascalou,40,Such a great and intimate place,"Love Pascalou. Had dinner with a friend. The food is excellent. I had the risotto with shrimp and scallops. My friend ordered the grilled salmon which looked delicious, but the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is that the salmon came very rare when she specifically asked for medium. It had to be sent back, disrupting the meal together. Otherwise, I highly recommend this wonderful neighborhood place!"

Pascalou,40,Appropriate Follow-up,"As a follow-up to my review of 12/22 I want to thank Lotte for her recent phone call regarding my visit in December. She was extremely apologetic and expressed her concern regarding my experience at Pascalou. She graciously provided me with an opportunity to come back with a gift certificate towards my next visit. Her responsiveness was appropriate and welcome. All restauranteurs should take a lesson from Pascalou. Customer service is so important. Thank you, again, Lotte."

Pascalou,50,Last minute lunch date,We used to frequent this place much more regularly but it has been 12 months since we are there. Best kept secret is the cheese and ham soufflé -- if they have time to make it... truly a French petit déjeuner !  My friends has pasta loved it.  Service is great and as we were there very early it wasn't crowded.  Will be back again sooner I hope.

Pascalou,40,Busy and good hangout of locals,"I've been twice now, both times with very good food (some dishes excellent others not bad) and friendly efficient service, in spite of a full rather crowded space. But it's not bad to be close to other diners when they are friendly. Each time, my dinner companion, who was from the neighborhood, saw at least someone she knew and we had interesting conversations. We had an octopus salad that had good sized very tender pieces of octopus with fresh greens and a nice dressing, along with a mushroom millefeuille that had good mushrooms but a bit soggy and too much garlic. The main courses were a shrimp risotto that was just ok and venison, which was very flavorful but a bit more cooked than I ordered. We shared a chocolate souffle for dessert that was outstanding! All in all, we'll probably try it again when we don't want to leave the neighborhood."

Pascalou,50,Old fashioned Bistro style,"Excellent food and service. Lovely atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Convenient to Upper East shops and the MET. White tablecloths, traditional bistro food. Fresh and well prepared."

Pascalou,40,simple and delicious,"a cozy little restaurant that I found by chance. We were looking for a lunch meal and they had two different egg-based meals that were both excellent. At the peak time, there was a line-up to get in.    I would go again if in the area."

Pascalou,50,Great value for a delicious dinner,"If your looking for great service, awesome flavor and an excellent value, look no further! For less than $30 Dlls you get a delicious 3 course meal in a cozy restaurant with amazing service. We got the baked Brie with toasted almonds and roasted asparagus (my favorite), for the entree we had the salmon (amazing!) and the ravioli, for dessert the coconut ice cream with pineapple and banana bread pudding. We really recommend that you try this place if you’re around, the portions are very well served. Enjoy."

Pascalou,40,Staying in the neighborhood,"Being a French restaurant, I called to ask whether they had sweetbreads on the menu as a nightly special. The answer was not only ""yes"" but they would make certain they would have them the night I came in. They were delicious.  Now, unfortunately some not so positives. The Caesar salad was a mis-nomer. There were apples and walnuts in what was served. When I asked why the salad seemed like a Waldorf salad, the woman replied, ""because that's the way my husband chose to make it. Then, I said something about the heavy perfume that the server was wearing and this same woman said, ""oh I know, it's awful isn't it?"" So, what can I assume, ""it's a nice place, but don't rock the boat."""

Pascalou,50,Don't leave NYC without trying Pascalou.... a little French gem.,"We had spent 4 hours wandering around the Met , and were looking for a late lunch when we stumbled into this gem in Madison ave.  What a magnificent meal and at a price for NY that I consider a steal.  We shared a french onion soup that was the equal of those we ate in Paris 2 years ago.  My wife had the half chicken with rosemary roast potatoes and vegetables, I was fortunate enough to have the special of the day which was rabbit, it was so good I didn't offer my wife a taste. We both had desert , apple tart and strawberry mille, a glass of wine each and we wrapped up a 5 star lunch for under $110 without the tip.  Thankyou Robbie R for the excellent attention.  This was our greatest value meal in NYC."

Pascalou,50,Prix Fixe dinner a good value; walking distance from the Metropolitan Museum of Art,"My husband researched ahead of time on the web to find a good restaurant near the Metropolitan Museum of Art for dinner with our college-age nephew from California (who appreciates fine food as much as we do).    We made reservations for 5:30 on a Tuesday night, and it's a good thing we did, because even though the city was very empty (most locals being out of town on vacation at the end of August), the restaurant was quite full. I suspect that this was because the ""Twilight"" Prix Fixe menu is a great value for such well-prepared food.    Between us, we had baked brie, soup, and salad appetizers; followed by fish, and duck leg confit entrees. Tart, and ice cream desserts rounded out the menu.    I'm sure that we will be dining here again, as we love visiting the Met when we're in the city."

Pascalou,40,Pleasant retreat,"This is a lovely unpretentious restaurant to get away from the hustle bustle of Manhattan. The food was fresh and of high quality. The staff were friendly and helpful. There is a economical fixed price menu. I would only recommend that they improve their coffee, otherwise it was a satisfying lunch."

Pascalou,40,Great Restaurant,"We have eaten at Pascalou numerous times over the past 10 years or so and never have had a bad meal. Their ""twilight special"" dinners at around $30 is a great bargain with a good variety of three courses."

per se,30,Poor management,"I had a 5 o’clock table for four at the lounge. This is the second time this manager short abrupt Spanish person spoke to me, inappropriately abruptly and arrogantly, and I’ll tell you who it was it. It was not Stephen I don’t know the managers name, but this is the second time this gentleman is giving me a hard time, and I’ve been to a restaurant on many occasions, and he was well aware of that."

per se,20,"Amazingly average, echos what the NY Times Critique.","I paid over $2,000 for the “upgraded menu”. Yes you heard right, over $2k for my wife and I. I heard Per Se received a negative review, and Chef Keller took it seriously and personally coached all the staff. Yet my experience echos the recent criticism.    First, most courses are so salty, I'm surprised Per Se is not hosting its own oceanic ecosystem. It's like the chef accidentally sneezed while seasoning and mistook the salt for confetti.    Secondly, the flavor is average - I was eating and waiting for the “wow” moment that never came. I went to many Michelin starred restaurants. I vividly remember the amazing teas at Oriole, the Arctic Char and the Netflix show worthy dessert presentation from Alinea, and the astonishing Uni Egg with Caviar at Providence. Yet, it’s only been three months since I dined at Per Se and don’t recall any dishes, especially for a $2000 meal.    Third, the service isn’t Michelin star worthy. It's like the staff attended a seminar on 'How to Be Inoffensively Blah.' There was no smile from anyone, even as I smiled at them and tried to be as polite as I could. Maybe this is just a New Yorker thing, or maybe they don’t think I belong there by the way I dress. Either way, I think Warren Buffet would not have a good time there (because he certainly doesn’t drive a fancy car or wear Gucci).    Hey Michelin Guide, do us all a favor and please, please, please reevaluate the Stars this restaurant deserves."

per se,50,Astonishingly good,"The entire experience was absolutely divine. As someone that dines by themselves fairly often, and has had a handful of unpleasant dinners as a result, this was the exact opposite.    Everyone at the restaurant made me feel extremely welcome, because they know that someone dining alone really does appreciate food. And, in return, their attention to detail (both in terms of hospitality and the food itself) was appreciated.    Even the extra little dishes they provided that were not on the menu were exceptionally good. And the chocolates, despite being so simple, were the best chocolates I've ever had - they were almost worth the expense of the dinner by themselves!    The price means it's obviously not an everyday occasion, but I will definitely be going back when I get the chance."

per se,50,Wonderful,"We loved Per Se. We had the tasting menu and wanted the paired wines but knew we wouldn't be able to drink them all. The sommelier was nice enough to provide us a reduced set of wines for the price of just one normal pairing and we loved what we were served.    The food was a wonderland of tastes, beautifully prepared, creative but not weird, and absolutely delicious. If cost is an issue, that probably puts too much pressure on the meal and then people are super-critical. But we just loved it.    The staff were fun as well, with lots of personality. We really enjoyed them.    We also loved that the seating is such that no one has to look at a wall. Many an expensive dinner has been ruined elsewhere by looking at walls.    Next time we're in NYC we will do it again."

per se,30,Disappointing!!,"This restaurant is great for tourists. This restaurant is NOT good for someone who understands good food. I've eaten at 11 Madison, Piaza Duomo, BlueHill at Stone Barn, and Alinea. Per Se doesn't even come close !!!    SERVICE:  The servers are friendly but not trained well enough to serve in a fine establishment.  Even the plates didn't match for the same dish served to all the guests - did they not have enough marching plates?  Server's communication was not clear    FOOD:  No plate cleaners were offered between meals.  The fried dishes were very oily.  Nothing really memorable or very creative was served.    Overall- extremely disappointing- what a pitty.    Michelin - stop the madness!"

per se,10,Tragedy of American high-end restaurant gourmet food,"Had a birthday party there recently. The hors d’oeuvres were ok as far as hors d’oeuvres went, I would rate them to be average, or 3/5. They included Wagyu beef, etc., good materials but below average cooking method.    But the main dishes were absolutely horrible, not palatable at all. Here is a summary of the problems were:  1. All the main dishes, including Salmen, chicken & lam were cold. Those were all sous vide cooked many hours prior to serving. The staff did not even bother to heat them up. I was expecting some sauté dishes with Maillard reaction, but no, all served were cold and unpalatable dishes.    2. All food is absolutely bland. Except for some salt, there was no seasoning, spice, or aroma of any kind. The food simply gagged me.    3. I do not know the price our party host paid, but from reviews of similar prefix menu there, I know it would be in excess of $1,000 per person.    The wines served on the other hand were excellent, the best i had in a long while."

per se,50,Good,"Per Se is, without question, an incomparable culinary experience that lacks an equal. As you enter the sleek and classic dining room overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park, you feel like you're simultaneously transported to the classic supper clubs of the 40's, without losing the substance, complexity, and modernity of today's greatest bakers and chefs."

per se,40,Fine dining experience,"I booked Per Se, and then my flight and hotel. It was a fine dining experience. For a Michelin 3-Star restaurant, the food was very good but not exceptional. The only dish that impressed me the most was the green circle Amish chicken – very original, creative, and flavorful. The variety of desserts was unexpected – they were wonderful! In addition to the 9-course meal of $390 pp, they offered other dishes ranging from $40 to $130. The staff was attentive and friendly. We were lucky Chef Thomas Keller was on site. He came out to greet the guests, and we took a picture with him."

per se,50,Absolutely the best meal we've had all year! (Even for Celiac disease folks),"What can I say? Celiac heaven! The staff were so understanding for our 2 with Celiac (and very sensitive to contamination). We had the 9 course tasting menu and the 2 with Celiac had a slightly modified menu. We all LOVED it and no contamination! A beautiful night of absolutely delicious GF food. Absolutely worth the money!  Hint: If time allows, you can ask for a tour of the kitchen....a treat to see!"

per se,40,"Still worth the visit, in my opinion!","Per Se is an iconic New York restaurant by The French Laundry’s chef, Thomas Keller. It doesn’t disappoint: the appetizers, cheeses and desserts from the tasting menu are some of the best food we’ve ever had in New York. I’d highlight the impeccable oysters with caviar, the tomato and heart of palm salad, the cheese pastry with truffles, the chocolate chai pudding, and the cappuccino ice cream. The view from the tables is gorgeous. Service is also top notch and delightfully friendly (feels like you’re not on Manhattan - chuckles).    We just weren’t as impressed with the meat dishes - the crab pierogi was good, but not mouth-dropping; the chicken was the best of the three, but still not awe inspiring; and the lamb prime rib tasted blander and less tender than we hoped.    I’m giving 4/5 stars only because, when you pay this high a price for a meal, my expectations are that every step of it will be moving and memorable. This was the case with a good part of the menu, but far from all of it."

per se,30,Beauty & The Beast,"Without doubt, the best meal I have ever had (& I’ve been lucky to dine in some of the best restaurants in the world).    Brilliant ingredients, perfectly cooked, impeccably served by a wonderful front of house team.    It’s expensive but more than worth it if you can afford it.    But…as I was basking in the afterglow of the finest culinary experience I’ve ever had, I was brought back to earth with a bump when I turned my attention to the check.    So confused have I become by New York’s baffling array of new tipping protocols I called Per Se prior to attending to ensure I had correctly understood their concept of “Service included”. “Service is included” I was assured.    Yet, at the end of the meal - CLUNK!! There it was in black and white on the credit card slip, “Service included” it yelped, but then added a snarling, stage-whispered, “Optional Gratuity” prompt. It was all wrapped up in a leather wallet and handed to me by the delightful waitress who had charmed us throughout the meal.    What the heck is one supposed to do? I wasn’t alone in my dismay, the gentleman on the table beside us asked the waitress “what’s with this extra gratuity thing? I thought it was service included?”.    “We’re paid an hourly rate…” she started…but the deafening clunky clattering of an embarrassed, confused and bemused customer drowned out whatever she said next.    “It’s my new favourite restaurant” he said, “but…this is all a bit weird”.    I felt similarly. A place like this doesn’t need to humiliate its customers in this way.    Yes, most of their clientele will either be filthy rich enough to throw down a few hundred extra dollars without batting an eyelid or not give a fig about leaving nothing.    This gauche, grubby hand-held-out, last ditch effort to extract who knows how many hundreds of dollars more - should surely be below an establishment of this class. Yet it stoops that low, turning the cheapest of tricks.    The only people bothered by this revolting practise are those who can just about afford this brief foray into the world of luxury dining. They will either be shamefully bullied into leaving an extra one or two hundred dollars they can ill afford, or left feeling somewhat shabby and embarrassed by their decision not to.    I was aiming to make another visit next month when I’m back in New York, pushing the boat out again, but it’s clear that this restaurant would rather gorge itself on clientele with deeper pockets than mine.    It’s not gauche per se, yet it’s certainly on the cusp of being so when it comes to an unnecessarily (un)happy ending.    In spite of the fabulous food, I left with a bad taste in my mouth."

per se,50,"Fantastic dinner, perhaps my new favorite in NYC","Our dinner last Wed night at 3* Per Se was phenomenal. I’d always avoided dining here due to the ridiculous jacket requirement (that’s now only recommended) and after a good but otherwise unremarkable dinner at French Laundry many years ago.    To say this was a vast improvement is an understatement. Per Se hit it out of the park for me. Everything was stellar. The food was sublime. I even loved the signature oyster and pearls — even as I’m not fond of oysters. The foie gras add on was delish. The black truffle add on for the risotto must have been the most generous truffle servings I’ve ever seen anywhere; they returned for a second helping of truffles without being asked and dropped enough each time to make me literally salivate. Every course was incredible, and all of the wine pairings were inspired and outstanding.    Service was polished and formal — but definitely relaxed once I got them going. We joked around with the team and had a good time of it. That’s a big plus for me to avoid the stodgy atmosphere that too often can accompany more stars.    I’d return in a heartbeat."

per se,30,Most of the food was tasty,"though, a dish or two were too sweet. But, I have to say this, be prepared to be hungry when you get home. Their 'duck breast' entree on the menu was literally the width of a strip of bacon... I could have eaten it in one bite. Luckily, it was on a vendor's bill."

per se,50,Fantastic …,"Although I would still prefer the less New York style and vibe of the French Laundry in Napa, this place again creates an outstanding food experience very few in this world can create. Every dish of the pre-set menu is unique and another fantastic experience. A beautiful evening … supported by excellent staff … and of course great wines. Just SUPER."

per se,50,One of the best experiences,"Had a wonderful evening here with friends. It was simply amazing! The food, the atmosphere and the service were outstanding."

per se,20,"Great view, food not so great",Nothing was delicious. Nothing was bad. The taste of the food is not up to the standards of a gourmet restaurant. The wine paring serves predominantly well chosen sub $100 wines (some $30 bottles are served) with the exception of the champagne

per se,10,"Very disappointing experience, very average cuisine for a ridiculous price.","The food was fine but extremely overpriced, with zero special details, surprises or extra effort which is a must for a 3 michelin star restaurant. Very mediocre cuisine for 3000 usd for a table of 4persons. Extremely disappointing."

per se,50,A dream culinary NYC experience,"A US/NYC culinary Michelin star establishment. Per Se is a superb 3 Michelin star restaurant. Jaw dropping views, brilliant thoughtful service, delicious food and first rate and surprisingly value for money wine list. Worth the splurge."

per se,50,Superb experience,"What a setting to enjoy post-Covid lockdown! Classy decor, very professional and at the same time friendly service (funny sommelier!), unforgettable food services with researched ingredients, selection of wines to die for. Thanks to all the team for such wonderful evening!"

per se,50,Absolutely Wonderful,"Just an incredible experience. Décor is simply gorgeous, service is just the best. And the food is to die for. Beautifully presented, and a wonderful range of tastes. Great views of Central Park, and definitely worth the splurge."

per se,10,“Are we at Applebee’s or are we at Per Se?” Buyer Beware,"""Are we at Per Se or are we at Applebee's?"" This was the question on our minds as we ate dinner. Buyer beware - do not come to Per Se if you are expecting a refined and elegant dining experience. Per Se has no expected standards of attire and behavior being enforced confirmed by its own maitre d Alex Pimentel. This failure of the purported three Michelin star institution greatly reduced the quality and enjoyment of our experience and was far below what we have experienced in the past at Per Se or other three Michelin star restaurants.    One table in our direct view had two very old men with two teenaged-looking girls. One girl was wearing sweatpants, a crop top, and flip flops. The other girl was wearing a sweatshirt and sneakers. One of the old men had a little black puppy with him and Per Se allowed the puppy to run around the floor of the dining room throughout the dinner. Another table next to us was obnoxiously loud throughout the evening, taking over the space and taking away from everyone else's enjoyment.    It was clear from the circus around us that Per Se has no standards for guest attire or behavior and does not care about guest experience at all. When I wrote to the restaurant after our dinner to share our feedback, the maitre d Alex Pimentel asked me to call him to talk. After playing phone tag a couple times, we were finally able to connect. Alex began the phone conversation by flippantly stating ""I understand you had a problem with some guests who weren't dressed as nicely as you would have liked?"" Wow. This is the guy they put in charge of guest relations? What a great attitude for the job. Alex ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time by making up excuses for every single aspect of our underwhelming dining experience. According to Alex:    1) Per Se does not have a dress code for women, only for men. Women can apparently dine in a string bikini and flip flops. Alex says: ""Per Se gets people from all walks of life and unfortunately we really only enforce a dress code for men.""    2) Alex said the old men were hotel guests and that they were dining with their ""nieces or daughters."" I told him that we could not care less where the old men were lodging or the nature of their relationship with the teenaged girls, but that the young women should at the very least not be wearing sweatpants, crop tops, flip flops, sweatshirts, and sneakers. Alex once again reiterated that there is no dress code for women.    3) Alex could not come up with an excuse for the puppy running around.    4) Alex said that if we were disappointed at any point in the evening with our experience, the burden was on us to try to create the experience we want. Alex said we should have complained about the other guests (all seated within earshot) and we may have been reseated space permitting. So a three Michelin star restaurant is putting the onus on its guests to create a fine dining experience. Why would it be on guests to make sure Per Se enforces basic standards of attire and behavior of other guests? When Per Se allows a circus in its dining room, Per Se is not going after a three Michelin star experience. When the maitre d tells guests that it is actually their burden and responsibility to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience, there is something terribly wrong with the training and culture at Per Se.    5) Food: lobster was extremely chewy like bubblegum. The chicken was bland and a bit rubbery. Loved the crispy skin on the bass. Lamb was just lamb, but on the tougher side. The wagyu was unremarkable. Black truffle pasta was delicious with a generous shaving of truffles.    6) Service: star is for Maris who was fantastic and we appreciated her excellent service and professionalism. Maris seemed to be the only one we encountered at Per Se who was aware that the restaurant is supposed to provide a three Michelin star experience. The wine pairing was $350 and the sommelier was perfunctory and inattentive.    Alex concluded our phone conversation with an underwhelming, ""well in the future please reach out to me to coordinate your next visit to Per Se."" He didn't even offer a genuine apology without excuses or any gesture of good will from the restaurant.    Will we be coming back to Per Se after this experience and Alex's response to our feedback? As Randy Jackson once eloquently stated, ""Yeah that's gonna be a no from me, dawg."""

per se,50,Black Truffle and Caviar Menu,"We are probably a little bit of a challenge for high end restaurants to impress. Debbie puts Per Se at number 4 and I put it at number 5 on our all time starred restaurant experiences. Pricewise, it was more than double the next closest, but that was because it was a black truffle and caviar menu. Their standard menu would have put them at about 3rd or 4th pricewise.    If you have ever wondered about truffles, after this menu, you will wonder no more. Our favorite restaurant in Atlanta--La Grotta—pushes truffles when they have them. We may never be able to order truffles again. We are truffled to the max. As far as caviar, it was not nearly as heavy. I suspect they over bought truffles, and because of covid they did not sell as well as expected. To get rid of the truffles, they had this special dinner, and layered them on. They even covered the chocolate dessert course in truffles. Interestingly, the course we called best, the dover sole, was truffle free. Perhaps it was the contrast.    Let me compare tonight with our number one restaurant experience. Number one was Guy Savoy in Paris. We did their tasting menu, but Guy Savoy also has ala carte offerings. While we were dining, a mother/son pair was served ala carte salmon cooked tableside on dry ice. My wife was fascinated and the headwaiter noticed. The head chef appeared at our table and added an extra course to our menu—salmon cooked tableside on dry ice. That, in and of itself, set the service bar at an impossibly high level. At the end of the meal, my wife asked if they had tea. A cart appeared cover with tea trees—10 feet high. A waiter interrogated her on her tea preferences, and clipped leaves from various trees and prepared her tea tableside from those leaves—extraordinarily impressive. Per Se was very good, but they did not hit the extraordinary level.    Per Se’s sommelier was probably the best we have ever had. Not only could he lecture on all of the technical attributes of the various wines, he had a confident personality. Here is an example of what we appreciated about Per Se’s sommelier. We tend to take note of the stemware a restaurant uses. Per Se had a variety: some hand-blown Riedels, some machine made Riedels, one Zalto, and toward the end, they served a glass marked “Riedel Restaurant.” So I was jabbing him about serving such pedestrian glassware. He immediately retorted, “Sir, those glasses are so exclusive they are unavailable to the public.” Touché. However, there was one minor service gaff. Our dessert course was served before the dessert pour, even before the dessert wine glasses were placed. We had to remind them to serve the dessert wine, and our frozen desserts were melting as we waited. Although, after we reminded them, they were prompt.    We are thrilled that we did Per Se. I will however offer one criticism. The wagyu course was not A5. We know what A5 wagyu tastes like, and this was not A5. Admittedly Per Se did not tout that it was A5, they touted it as “genuine Japanese wagyu—the real thing.” Apparently, they anticipate that most of the customers do not realize that “genuine Japanese wagyu—the real thing” is graded, and this was a lesser grade. It should have been A5 at this price point.    I asked the number 2 waiter whether I could check Thomas Keller off of our to do list. I will paraphrase his answer. The French Laundry has a California Vibe that contrasts with the New York Vibe of Per Se, but the food sensations will be similar. We will return to Guy Savoy, before we do the French Laundry."

per se,50,Amazing dining experience,"Beautiful restaurant, amazing dining experience, excellent staff. This was the best dining experience this trip, and we did Daniel and the Modern the two evenings prior. We have had the opportunity to dine at French Laundry twice, the Meadowood, Single Thread, and Eleven Madison Park before it went vegan.  There are many similarities btwn Per Se and French Laundry from the salmon amuse bouche to the chocolate truffles. Although I do like the shortbread cookies at French Laundry a bit better. This was a very enjoyable divert and I would definitely go back next time I'm in NYC."

per se,30,"Good, but Falls Short of Expectations","I think it's important to contextualize this review. Per Se is certainly an excellent restaurant with outstanding food and service. However, I'm writing my review based on the expectations I would have of a 3 Michelin Star establishment that is supposed to be at the pinnacle of cuisine. Thomas Keller and his restaurants have an immaculate reputation, and my experience at Per Se didn't live up to that. I'm going to focus on the things that didn't pass muster in my opinion, so you can assume that if I don't mention it, it was excellent.    Service - The meal starts off on a bit of a sour note with an upsell of ""accompaniments"" which include truffle tagliatelle, wagyu beef, and foie gras. I understand these items are more expensive, but I don't find it appropriate to have to purchase them as additions at the meal. I'm happy to pay more for the meal up front and just have these items as part of the menu. When I show up, I'm expecting the best the restaurant can offer, and it's really disappointing to start off a meal knowing I won't be getting it. It just felt cheap. The drinks service was a little slow. Our second round of cocktails took quite a bit to come to the table. The staff refilling our water repeatedly spilled some few drops during the pour. Again, none of these items are a big deal, but they fall short of expectations.    Food - This is the more important part. Simplicity is important in high level cuisine. The salad, however, seemed almost lazy in its simplicity, with only 3 elements on the plate aside from the dressing. While the carrots were stunning, the tempura broccoli and fennel bulb didn't seem like well thought out and constructed complements. An alternative would be to not call it a salad and just construct it as a carrot dish. Otherwise, I expect additional elements that are more harmonious. The duck dish was the most disappointing. The duck was a little tough in parts, not as tender as I'd expect. The radicchio was bitter, and the accompanying grapes were bland (where'd the grape flavor go?). The Jus de Canard had a burnt flavor to it which was unpleasant. The duck fell quite far below standard. On the lamb dish, the dates were the highlight. They were the most flavorful component, while the lamb was a little bland and didn't really shine.    All in all, I think the experience was a bit of a disappointment. Going to a restaurant like this, I expected perfection, or as close to it as one can get. That's not what I experienced during my visit."

per se,40,Experience multi course Michelin menu from Napa's famous French laundry chef with a 5 course or 10 course option,"Given CA Napa's french laundry is more pricey and booked a year ahead, per se is a good option if you are in NYC for a special occasion.    I believe it was named Per we because the founder said "" this is not French laundry per se'""    We ordered a 5 course menu for my sisters 50th birthday with a vegetarian menu. The first course was a French onion soup with purple yam, crispy shallots and hazelnuts. The second was a parsnip pastrami with farm radish, capers and celery leaf aioli  The borscht with brussel sprouts and ravioli type cabbage dumplings was amazing. ..  As we were getting full, the poached egg with malabar spinach was average but the consistency was great for the poached egg.  The next course with cheese and truffles was just too heavy for us but the portion size was small luckily.  The dessert menu was just amazing and the bet part with sticky toffee pudding, vanilla bean ice cream, dark chocolate torte, triple chocolate birthday cake, semi freddo coffee foam and ice cream.for sharing they gave donuts, macaroons and chocolate to go.  It was about USD 200 to 250 per person and the experience was very memorable. They can make a personalized menu."

per se,20,Money Hungry,"I made reservations and paid in advance as required 200.00 for 4 people on Fridays October 8th 2021 , one could not attend had break through COVI -19 ( vaccinated ) 3 of us attended the dinner and spend over 1500 dollars , they would not credit us the 200.00 paid in advance for person 4"

per se,50,Perfect,"Dining at per se is more like going to the theater than going to a restaurant. Amazing food, friendly, helpful staff in a great space with a spectacular view. Beyond pricy but again, it’s not just a dining experience."

per se,50,Impeccable!,"Although the dining hall was filled with patrons, the atmosphere felt quiet and relaxed. We were seated by the window and had a good view of the Columbus circle at sundown. The dishes were pleasing to the eyes and more so pleasing to my palate. I thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes, but these were my favorites - salmon tartare cornet, oysters and pearls, poussin, grilled wagyu, gougère, and pavlova.  I have nothing but praises for the staff. They were attentive, pleasant, engaging, helpful, and not obtrusive. Overall, our experience was superb. We will certainly return!"

per se,40,So close to being exceptional!,"My family and I went for my 30th birthday dinner. We felt like royalty from the moment we first walked in to the moment we left. Everyone was incredibly attentive, professional, and our waitress Christie had some great wine recommendations. I loved listening to her explain the wines she thought I would like best. We had a couple of other people serving us and they were great also.  I have to say the best dish was the oyster and caviar. Incredibly flavorful, it was definitely the grand slam of the menu. However, it seems that the options offered at a higher price did not necessarily go hand in hand with the exceptional flavor. Lobster and caviar was a miss, the serving needs to be slightly bigger for those extra $60. I was also especially disappointed with the tagliatelle option. I’m a big black truffles fan so I thought it would be the best dish yet, but it was incredibly underwhelming. Those truffles from Australia had zero flavor and the pasta per se also wasn’t anything out of this world…and $100 more for that? They drenched the dish with so much shaved truffle it seems to make up for the obvious lack of flavor…over $200 extra for two underwhelming plates and now we have an overprice issue.  On the contrary, we were impressed with the amount of dessert we received, zero complaints there! I also have to say I really enjoyed the custom made menu with my name on it signed by the chef, very nice touch.  Overall, we were very pleased with our experience, I’m happy I decided to celebrate my 30th there as they definitely made me feel like royalty. I wish they could take this review seriously and make those small changes that will make a huge difference for future guests."

per se,20,Oh dear oh dear oh dear,"Honestly, no point in going into any huge detail - suffice to say the experience can be summed up in this: miserable-looking patrons all around us eating slimy overly-processed gooey overpriced food for hours. How they turned lobster into a slimy bowl of children's food, I do not know. Desserts very poor too, and even the huge and impressive box of chocolates that appears at the end tastes...well, underwhelming at best.    Main memory is perversely enjoying how much we had to pay to get this ricidulous experience.    Also - supercilious seems to be the order of the day, too, just to round the experience off."

per se,30,Bit dissapointed,"I was in Us for few days so i was the opportunity to dine at Per Se.  I had the strange feeling, i used to travel and eat in many restaurants worldwide but the athmosphere was so heavy and very old style dishes and ambiance.  The view on central park and the chimney safe my dinner."

per se,50,Fabulous family birthday celebration!!!,"I am visiting my daughter, granddaughter and future son-in-law in NYC. For my daughter’s early birthday we reserved seating at Per Se in the salon. We had a 9 year old with us and my daughter had called ahead to make sure that was OK. Our experience was excellent in every way. Our server, Brian, was personable and anticipated our needs. Three adults did the 5 course tasting menu. The sommelier helped us select half bottles of champagne, a white and a red wine. We also had cocktails and after dinner drinks. My granddaughter was brought the same amuse bouche that we got and the same desserts. In addition she had 2 Shirley Temples and 3 courses just for her - cream of asparagus soup, pasta, and sea bass. They did not charge us one cent for my granddaughter’s meal. Obviously we added a larger tip but came away so impressed with this restaurant. I wish I had gotten the name of the sommelier. He, too, was excellent. Everyone that helped us was lovely and I can’t recommend Per Se enough. Good job everyone!!"

per se,50,"Excellent, but 3 Stars?","Eight courses, $355/person including service, and excluding tax, supplements, and drinks. Supplements were foie gras ($30), pasta w truffles ($150) and Waygu beef ($100).    Some were outstanding. My favorite were the caviar and oysters (Oysters and Pearls) and the quail ""sushi-like"" dish. Not so hot on the Lobster Boudin (lobster mouse) or the foie gras (mouse). I would have preferred the lobster to feature real pieces of lobster and the foie gras itself to be less mousy and more flavorful. I think the fpie gras was intentionally lightly flavored blend more subtly to go with the other ingredients). Deserts were pretty strong across the board.    Listen, this is beautiful and very elegant restaurant. It just doesn't knock it pout of the park on all courses. I was looking for more bites of wow. I would not rush back, but would go again, another time, another season.    The service was excellent. Definitely three star there. I think the ingredients were also 3 star."

per se,50,Amazing Service,"This is a long overdue review.    Our family went to New York in August of 2019 to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. I had planned a special dinner for him at Per Se.    When I made the reservation, the response from the restaurant was very accommodating and considerate as our daughter was going through some allergy investigations. They were very thoughtful of her health, but also wanted to ensure that our family would be able to have a full experience of the tasting menu.    The day of our reservation, we were delayed due to heavy traffic, but the staff were gracious enough to hold our requested table by the window for us. We knew it was an auspicious start to a great culinary experience. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. We had a generous evening of 11-12 courses - one of which was the tagliatelle with a copious amount of truffles. The children loved the soft cocktails that were made for them. The attention to detail is on an unparalleled level. Service was exceptional - it was very professional, but also very personable. We enjoyed our interaction with Sandra - who, at the end of the evening, invited our family on a tour of the kitchen.    My husband had a wonderful 50th birthday dinner. Thank you Per Se!"

per se,40,Lovely dinner,"What can I say that hasn’t already been said about this three Michelin star, Relais & Château, world renowned restaurant. The team was on point all night long, some of them even referencing my blog during dinner service and spoke with a gentleman who worked at the Ledbury in London. Everyone was very friendly. Very cool to get a tour of the kitchen. Perhaps a tad bit pricey for the food itself, but I suppose you’re paying for the experience - and their rent. One thing that I’m disappointed with is that some items were repeated from my meal at the french laundry from 3 years ago. I understand that they are Chef’s staples, but still, he can create a different staple for different locations, can’t he? Definitely a bucket list restaurant checked and enjoyed!"

Petrossian,50,Please try!,"I came with my mom and sister who both love caviar. Me, not so much. They LOVED the caviar. I had a salad and lamb that were both excellent. My sister also had the truffle pasta and was very happy with it. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Quiet atmosphere and delicious food."

Petrossian,50,More Than Just Caviar - But the Caviar is Pretty Special,We had a delightful meal here while in Paris. Service was fantastic and every dish was excellent. Because we began at 7:30 we were the only ones there for a while. Our server assured us that it was fully booked from 9:30 on. In a quiet neighborhood just a few blocks south of the Seine.

Petrossian,50,Petrossian Restaurant - Caviar,"Great Caviar Tasting. Elegant interiors, very helpful staff, exceptional caviar quality. Highly recommended"

Petrossian,50,perfect lunch,"We happily stumbled across Le Petrossian while walking around Paris and while we didn't have reservations, they could not have been nicer. Excellent service, outstanding food and wine!"

Petrossian,50,When its time to splurge,"Our Paris splurge. Of course during the late June heat wave their ac wasnt working but they had a fan.. We had 1st class service and everything was delicious. Got their basic 3 caviar tasting with an order of fish carpacio. They had this amazing spread as a starter. Add some bubbly and the night is complete. Not cheap- 208 euro for the caviar, carpacio, and 3 glasses of champagne but it was worth it."

Petrossian,30,Great Venue and showcase but very inexperienced staff.,"Excellent venue and location but we were sitted opposite the kitchen. Our first time to a caviar restaurant. The waIters were not experienced or they really loust it up when they switched waiters on us.The 1st waiter offered us champagne but then forgot to bring us our bottle. The caviar was excellent but no waiter when we needed service. We almost had to pour our own champagne twice. The 2nd time our new waiter asked us if we needed a bottle of champagne. Our champagne was still 1/2 empty. So in order to go thru the whole experience we decided to triy their grand dish from r two Deux. It was scalloped potatoes with caviar and dressing over the top. It was also delicious but they forgot about us again. Both waiters need to bare in mind from where I was sitting I can see both of them scratching their heads with their hands. I’ve always said I don’t mind the prices, I mind the food and service! I’m sure they will improve."

Petrossian,40,The place for Caviar,"In Paris - and was very well looked after by Elise and manager Jerome on this quietest of Saturday nights - but this is the best way in which to indulge in this Royal food of foods. Opted for the Oeuf Coque with ‘Chinese’ Caviar evoking memories of days past spent in China when the splendid Heilongjiang Caviar was freely available and as cheap as chips, accompanied this with some ice cold Stolichnaya Red label and very decent bottle of Chablis."

Petrossian,50,Worth every visit,Being no too big Fan of caviar so far we've gone for the small menue - given the quality this was a mistake. Never have had any caviar that good! Salomon has been great the meant perfect. If you don't need to count your money - give it a try...

Petrossian,10,Restaurant closed the day of our reservation,"We placed a reservation here last summer, and they wrote us: Merci d'avoir réservé sur Pétrossian. Nous vous confirmons la réservation suivante: Au restaurant : Pétrossian Le 29 juillet 2017 à 21:00 Pour 2 personnes Sous la référence : MULISBRC  When we arrived it was closed for summer holidays, but they did not wrote us about it, nor they answered the mail where I asked for an explanation. Too rude."

Petrossian,50,Very special!,the service is so kind and elegant and the caviar with its potatoes served on hot stone is a delicacy....the atmosphere is calm and allows discussion without interference of noise. A great experience!

Petrossian,50,Go while the dollar is strong,"The upstairs dining room is a jewel. The menu is limited, but highest quality. Courses are modest in proportion, but artfully presented. For lunch, two courses and desert will suffice for all but the most ravenous."

Petrossian,50,A great experience!!,"It was not our first taste of caviar but we wanted a more traditional experience and we told our waiter that we wanted to try caviar, different types in the most traditional way! So we tried 3 different types of caviar on boiled potato and cold vodka, for main course we had poached eggs with potato and caviar.....and it was fantastic. We ended up with a dessert like chocolate caviar with venezuelan Rum, also amazing, with cherry infused vodka. We had a lovely time, our waiter was very helpful and very very nice, the place is beautiful and clean, it was great!!!"

Petrossian,50,Wonderful birthday celebration,We walked in without a reservation & just before the kitchen closed for lunch. They couldn't have been more gracious. The food was wonderful & the service impeccable. When they learned we were celebrating a birthday they brought vodka shots on the house!

Petrossian,50,Still setting the tone !,"Second time at the Petrossian's restaurant le 144 and still the same very high quality food .  For lunch the 3 courses menu is at 35 euros but you can also choose from the caviar list ( I recommend the 3 samples of caviar to share or not served with hot patatoes , blinis and toasts .  The vodka selection offers you around 20 various vodkas. We loved the house vodka ""au poivre"" tinted red by the pepper .  A very nice place in a super district of Paris. The chef is excellent from starters to desserts .  Enjoy !"

Petrossian,40,"excellent, but not sure I would go back","I'm American but live in Paris (12 years) and was taken here for my 40th. I will start with the good points and then express my reservations. And in full disclosure I also own a restaurant in southwest France, not near this level of dining, but this makes me both more sympathetic and critical about certain things. I gave this place four stars because I had a nice time and the food was superb, but expectations were high...    Before I begin, here's what we had: a louche of caviar imperial, the smoked salmon, egg florentine with caviar imperial, pheasant stuffed with foie gras, crab cannelloni, crab salad with mango and sweet potato.    We drank a bottle of Pouilly Fumé, 1 vodka citron, 1 vodka herbes and 1 vodka cucumber. We shared 1 'baba' dessert, the house specialty, no coffee or digestif. We paid 235 Euros.    Strong points: the food and wine were excellent, which is is obviously the most important thing. These are high end 'Russian' tapas, light dishes, so they recommend you order four per person. This is a nice way of eating, so I get it. We had six dishes between us and it was enough. Some of the tastes we had were new, so bravo to the chef. Rave reviews are totally warranted.    Weaker points: Given the brand, the Russian theme, and the prices, I had certain expectations.    First, The vodka selection was not very good. We ordered surprisingly cheap vodkas to start, my 'citron' was yellow and tasted like limoncello... There wasn't much variety (see my review of Chemodan in Moscow). So next I sprang for the much pricier (American) cucumber vodka with my caviar, and it was good.    Second, the service was a tad slow given the crowd and number of staff. By the time the caviar came I was almost done with vodka #2. That said, we never poured our own wine, always had bread, so not a big problem here. Staff was friendly.    Third, it was a really small amount of caviar for 30 euros, like a small teaspoon full, and while very tasty, it was not mind-blowing. I'm not a caviar connoisseur so can't judge and I trust the house on this. But what I expected mainly from this experience was good caviar and good vodka. Clearly we would have had to spend a lot more money to get that here for the caviar, and the vodka was a non-starter for anything but the usual good stuff. Fair enough for the caviar, but they should be able to do better on the unusual vodkas. That the other fare was so good was the surprise I guess.    A point about the pheasant: there was buckshot in my truly excellent ""hunted"" pheasant, which was weird but luckily I didn't break a tooth or swallow it. The waiter said he would tell the chef but there was no apology or further mention of it. I don't buy the badge of honor thing (it's fresh-hunted, what do you expect?) because this was obviously farm-raised pheasant - I know what gamey is and this was anything but gamey, and it's well known that pheasant farms in France make money from releasing their birds and letting people shoot them.    The décor: Petrossian is a great brand with an excellent history that you can feel when you buy their products and go into their shop downstairs. Somehow they have created a restaurant upstairs that is modern, mirrored, beige and bland. Part of eating out is the atmosphere, and there was none here, except for the eccentric guy who ate dinner with his two boxers, which was great. With a brand like Petrossian, surely they could do something more special.    So overall I recommend this place for the food as long as you manage your expectations or as long you have big bucks for some serious caviar. The next time I want to spend 120+ euros per person on dinner or want to impress an out of town guest though, I would probably not come back here given the other options in Paris, but I don't regret coming here at all."

Petrossian,30,"Good food, mediocre service.","We are fans of the Petrossian products, but we usually enjoy them either in Galleries Lafayette or at home. It was the first visit to the restaurant . The menu is very interesting and the plates we tried were very tasty. Unfortunately the service was poor and for a restaurant of this price level, very poor. The water was served only the first round and then left on the table for ""self service"". The wine was served first round with the pre starter and although the glasses were empty when the first starter arrived we were served wine again only with the second starter. The second bottle of wine we order with our third course never arrived . The bill was asked three times to three different persons, in order to arrive. At the same time, they didn't look understaffed and the maitre was once too often at the table behind us , serving one vodka after the other ! It's a pity to spoil such good food with service issues that are so easy to solve."

Petrossian,50,Superb!! And a bargain :-),"The lunch menu -- simply an outstanding value/price! Tastes are subtle and refined, presentation of food exceptional, service impeccable. Will be back!"

Petrossian,50,I am astounded!,"I am astounded that there are not more reviews for this restaurant. I don't know if people feel intimidated or daunted about trying it, but if that's the case, please don't be! We went twice last year and just returned. On each occaision, we were greeted warmly by the young wait staff, who proceeded to go about their business professionally. The restaurant offers a 3 course luncheon menu for €35, which is unbelievably good and a great value. Other dining menus are offered, including some that are caviar-themed. The main draw, of course, is the caviar. If you love caviar, this is the place. You can order it by itself, with chilled vodka (my favorite) or with champagne. Price will vary depending on the type and grade of the caviar, but there is a separate menu to guide you through the selection process. Finally, the dining room is somewhat formal, but the tables are well-spaced and allows privacy, whereas in bistros, your elbows always seem to be in your neighbors soup. Absolutely worth the experience."

Petrossian,40,Merci à la famille Petrossian ...,"It was a wonderful birthday celebration. Inspired by our culinary bible, le guide Michelin, my husband and I took a walk on the not so wild side - route 144...  The service and the presentation were elegant and quite impeccable, the setting traditional. The presentation of the amuse-bouches very original.  I still dream of the caviar ""à la louche"" and the beautifully presented and oh so fresh saumon fumé, the blinis, the excellent and original toast, the crisp green salad topped with caviar ... Beautiful ...  My ""bar"" was out of this world. The oysters and asparagus to go with it yet another lovely touch that made my mouth water the moment the dish was set before me.  The sauces were exquisite - although my husbands' caviar sauce was perhaps a trifle intense for one who does not love caviar the way I do...  The tarte au citron for dessert - served with a candle, a delicate attention on the part of the staff that was much appreciated by me - was a little bit sweet for my taste, but that is just a matter of taste, after all...  The wines were up to par, both red and white - a wonderful selection.  The rosé champagne served in elegant glasses was a wonderful way to start our delicious venture.  On our way out, we were invited to a lovely liqueur by the staff.  Although I'm afraid I cannot exactly claim I was a cheap date, it was a wonderful way to celebrate my birthday!  Truly an unforgettable experience...  Un grand merci à la famille Petrossian..."

Petrossian,40,oh..no. changes made are not working,"I'm with some of the other recent reviewers. They reworked a restaurant and menu that was great and the change is not a good one. I am an avid Petrossian devotee, but the revised menu is not one I like. I'm definitely going to give it time and try again, but I do not hold much hope. Beautiful gifts and mail order still. Great holiday and special occasion gifts. I will not be gifting certificates for Paris Petrossian this year however."

Pigalle,20,Poor performance pigalle,"A long standing establishment in Cape Town that has lost its sparkle. The food was below average, the service was sporadic and the entertainment was mediocre whilst the prices stayed the same. Time to up your game Pigalle…"

Pigalle,40,Nice Dinner with Live Music,Good food and service. Kingklip was enough for two! Good entertainment from the house band and especially from the band playing Latin music for the last set.

Pigalle,40,Malva pudding,Good restaurant & excellent host. The food was great but the star had to be the malwa pudding. We tried malwa pudding was this in various out restaurants but none came close to one we had at this restaurant. Good live music.

Pigalle,50,Great time at Pigalle,Excellent as usual - we shared the seafood platter which is great and good value for money. Excellent service and setting too. One of the best if not the best in Cape Town for seafood

Pigalle,20,If you have one foot in the grave,"If you 80 or act as if you are, this is the place for you. Ok band, but they too are stuck in ABBA world and need more breaks than play time. Waiters are old schoot butlers with attitude and no service. Crème brûlée is tasteless and served in a weird dish. This was, could be, such a nice place, but now only good for 50th and beyond birthday parties or somewhere you take a date to dump him/her"

Pigalle,50,Warm and Delicious,Professional service. Warm and subtle lighting. Amazing food and to top the night off - live music. Highly recommend. :)

Pigalle,10,Acceptable food but terrible service!,Acceptable food but terrible service! Im still shocked about the bad service at this place! The place was also very cold. We both used our jackets the whole dinner

Pigalle,50,Great Food and Live Music,Went there with some friends the seafood was super fresh and the drinks were great. The live music gave the atmosphere a great vibe. One of the more expensive restaurants in the area but worth it.

Pigalle,50,Simple fare prepared perfectly,"A very cozy restaurant with great ambiance. The specialty is seafood, and they prepare it simply, but each plate has a singular amazing taste. The music is also great and you can dance if you want. DEFINITELY would go again and again."

Pigalle,50,Cape Town,"Cape Town is a must visit for World travellers. Great food, jazz, hotels, wine, horse racing, golf, and lovely people."

Pigalle,50,What an experience!!!,"Excellent dining experience. Great service, excellent food. Good pricing. Specials menu is good value. Well priced cocktails"

Pigalle,50,Suprisingly good,This was not our usual choice for a dining experience but it was in our neighbourhood so we decided to try it and were glad we did. We went early before the entertainment started as we like to be able to see what we are eating and also be able to have a conversation but having said that the background piped music was very much to our taste and we may well go back to listen to the live entertainment. The food was amazing. My husband had the Springbok and I haven't heard him rave about a dish this much for a very long time and we eat a lot of good food. I had the linefish lightly flavoured with ginger. The presentation was beautiful and it is so nice to have crunchy fresh vegetables.The malva pudding was to die for.

Pigalle,30,Food OK rest is 5 star,"Went to eat here last night with business associates.    The starter was fantastic flavour it was just cold and should have been served piping hot.    Main the fish was completely overcooked and the Sauce very watery, also Scallops which is part of the dish only got one super thin slice. For the price you pay i really would have expected more    Having said the above, the service was 5 star, our waiter was very attentave and really did a good job.    The band that came to play that is another 5 star they really set a great mood and atmosphere rwally well done.    All in all it was really a great evening which we enjoyed the food just got a bit derailed"

Pigalle,50,Valentines Night,"As always a wonderful personal greeting at reception by Warren and Managers  Escorted to our table with red rose for my wife and glass of bubbles . Wonderful fine dining food as always with John our waiter so attentive .  After dinner we thoroughly enjoyed the 4 piece band with the saxophonist playing around the room , which was a nice touch, followed by dancing.  For fine dinning, live music and dancing Pigalle in Cape Town cannot be beaten.  Well done guys"

Pigalle,50,Good food and nice band held promise,"We weren’t quite sure what to expect here, our 4th night of 5 in Cape Town and having had lovely “posh” dinners so far (including Fyn and Aubergine) wanted something a little more relaxed and fun and found Pigalle via TA.  The welcome from the manager and service from James, our waiter, was warm and attentive, 10 out of 10. The food also was excellent, considering this is a larger venue designed to cater for diners eating at similar times, some in large groups. I thoroughly enjoyed my Caprese salad and line fish main, husband similarly with his prawn starter and whole chicken main (plus was delighted to at last be somewhere with Heineken on draft rather than fancy craft bottled beers!). We had a lovely bottle of sparkling wine too and all at a very fair price, around £75 for 2.  We were delighted to have the band accompanying our meal too as we love live music. They were very good but we felt the potential to make it a really great atmosphere fell slightly flat, 3 x 40 minute sets with 20 min breaks inbetween, and nothing-y music played in the intervals over the speakers, felt a bit “ticking the box” and although some good tunes here and there, we didn’t really feel the enthusiasm needed to get the crowd going, and at 10pm they were off anyway which was the signal really for everyone to go (fair enough given covid times etc). We just felt there was great potential, with such a good band, for a very good night but it was slightly wasted."

Pigalle,50,Recommended place by the hotel,"Splendid. Top quality dishes, nicely and friendly served. Good atmosphere with a live band. Recommended by the hotel, next time by me!"

Pigalle,50,Celebrating 68 Years In Elegance!,"….We are here to celebrate my 68th birthday in sheer elegance as this true-lii is that kind of venue. When you arrive and enter the foyer you are overwhelmed by what meets the eye, it exudes class. As is the saying “first impressions last longest”. On our arrival here we were met by Warren the manager on duty who cordial-lii welcomed us and went through the Covid-19 safety protocols, no mask no entree, hand sanitiser-spray, info-form to fill out and the body temperature test. Once this was done he lead us to our table which was in the centre court just a bit away from the live-band in attendance but close enough to enjoy the pleasant background serenading. Here they have different seating areas which can be requested like the Elvis-Room, the side-seating behind the glass partitions and the more private seating-rooms which differ in its size depending on the party it can accommodate. All absolute-lii elegant-lii decorated with beautiful paintings and cloth-seat chairs around the tables. Our designated waiter was Kenny who was on top of his game and treated us as royal-til, if he was nearby and you moved he was there to pull-back your chair or replace your napkin on your lap. We started our evening of celebrations with ordering a well-chilled bottle of “PONGRACZ” Rose’. STARTERS:- 1. Oysters x 3 (served with lemon & Tabasco-sauces), 2. Prawns (sautéed with garlic & chilli), 3. Escargots (infused in cream-ii garlic butter) served with bread. All our starters were extreme-lii delicious. MAINS:- 1. Mozambican Prawn-curry (a flavour some mild curry with coconut & coriander), 2. Calamari (succulent tubes & squid-heads, grilled in garlic & lemon-butter) with a blue-cheese sauce, 3. Grilled Rib-eye (served with French-fries or Mash potatoes) a choice of sauce can be ordered as a side. Again our main dishes where delicious especial-lii the prawn-curry as the flavouring was indeed intriguing. DESSERTS:- 1. Baked Cheese-cake (Marbled chocolate & vanilla seeds cheeses-cake with white chocolate ganache), 2. Dom-Pedro with whisky. The ambience in this venue was festive as the live-band provided live-lii and groovy music which encouraged many of the patrons to take to the dance-floor. One of the surprising bonuses was when the band announced my name and sang “Happy Birthday” to me and the second surprising bonus was when Kenny brought me a “Pavlova” dessert (Creme Chantilly, tropical fruit with passion fruit) with a candle lite-up and “Happy Birthday” scrolled on the edge of the plate in chocolate. This was one magical evening to remember forever. This is a high-lii recommended restaurant and we will be back here again in the future for more exciting celebrations…"

Pigalle,50,Anniversary Dinner,"We came to the restaurant 10 years ago for our 10th wedding anniversary and thought it a good idea to repeat on our 20th anniversary because we had such a good time previously....it was a good decision.    Food was good, wine selection extensive and Joseph, our server did not miss a beat.  The music on the night was good with some familiar favourites.    We especially appreciated some personal touches in celebration of our celebration.    We will return....and not wait 10 years to do so."

Pigalle,50,lockdown visit,"this is definitely my favourite place to eat good food. been here a few times in lockdown, even when the curfew was very early. writing this review to mention how impressed i was with the Covid 19 protocols that were followed. we had an early dinner here when curfew was at 9 and i must say it was great. all protocols were followed with social distancing etc. we ahd to leave by 8pm so that they could get staff home by curfew at 9pm. then had lunch here on valentines day and even though there was quite a few people in the restaurant i never felt like anyone was too close to me. the tables were well spaced to not be in close proximity to the table next to us. the food was absolutely amazing as always. tried different combinations and it was really great. will definitely be back."

Pigalle,50,Amazing service and food,Took my boyfriend for his birthday and everything was absolutely amazing. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. The food was phenomenal 👌👌👌

Pigalle,40,One of the Best Restaurants for Prawns,This is one of the best restaurant for prawns and langoustines. The food was excellent. It's a discerning restaurant. 4.5/5

Pigalle,50,Simply Fantastic!,"From the time you arrive, you are spoilt with excellent service, magic ambience, exceptional food, and of course live music."

Pigalle,20,Covid breeding restaurant,We went on thé 11 Dec and I was a bit let down by them. The restaurant need a uplift it’s a bit tired. The chairs need to be upholstered as they very uncomfortable. The waiters need to be reached not to pour 1/2 glass of wine. And my main issue was that restaurants are suppose to run less tables. You where packed with no space between tables. The good was good but was a lot better when you opened. Unfortunately I will not return or recommend to go here

Pigalle,40,Dinner dance at Pigalle,"The ambiance is still excellent, always enjoy the live band. The garlic roll is excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and we were pleased with the recommendations he made. Only had starters and mains, the rib-eye stake was a very good portion, and of good quality. My wife had kingklip for her main course which was well prepared and served with vegetables."

Pigalle,50,Birthday Dinner,"I celebrated a birthday with my closest girlfriends. And it was one of my best yet. The food and general vibe ended up being in the spotlight that night. Truly amazing. Oh, and they have live music :)"

Pigalle,50,Saturday night pleasure,"Enjoying a fabulous evening at Pigalle is always the highlight of our social life. From the welcome by Toni, the service from Warren and his team, to the live band playing music for us to enjoy on the dance floor...and then the excellent food arrives! We started with mushroom ravioli and chicken livers. Delicious. Our main was the seafood platter for two which consisted of two crawfish, six prawns, calamari tubes and a fillet of fish with a side of mussels. That platter was well worth the R700 for two.  A bottle of rosé wine completed a wonderful evening."

Pigalle,50,Wedding Reception,"It was my niece's wedding reception. We were a table of 16. The service was superb thanks to the staff. It was over and above our expectations. We had a 3 course meal and the staff went out of their way to print pretty menus for the table. The live music was amazing, we danced and had so much fun. A truly memorable experience. LOVED IT."

Pigalle,50,Honeymoon restaurant choice - Incredible!,"Our server's name was Pride and he was incredible!    We were celebrating our honeymoon and told them before we were coming of the occasion. We went on a Saturday night. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The food was incredible, the alhocol was too. We ordered the seafood platter and a filet as well as multiple side dishes. We thoguht it would be too much food, we finished everything and were stuffed.    LIVE MUSIC! Not sure if this is a Sat night only thing, but the live music was so amazing, a nice touch. Music started around 8/8:30ish. We were eating dinner when it began, it was perfect volume, not too loud. We danced, what fun.    This was one of the ""upscale"" restaurants on our honeymoon trip and it was by far our favorite. Delicious."

Pigalle,40,Nice venue for a special occasion,"Enjoyed dinner here as we celebrated my husband's birthday. My colleague and I were looking for something a little more upscale with live music. Pigalle fit the bill in both categories. The food was delicious. The jazz was nice and played at a volume that still allowed for comfortable conversation. Some people even decided to dance. Definitely a nice ""grown-up"" venue."

Pigalle,50,back again,"this restaurant is one of my favourite places to visit for dinner. been back a few times. each time we have a great time. (barring little niggles here and there, nothing to make me stay away forever) the food is always great. ambience fabulous. always a wonderful experience."

Pigalle,50,One of the best restaurants in Cape Town,"Had a marvelous dinner with my wife at a very special occasion. Sarah our host made everything look to perfection and we ended up having a world class moment full of great food, music and dance. Couldn’t be better. I highly recommend Pigalle."

Pigalle,50,You know it's a good restaurant when....,You know that you're in a high class restaurant when a sorbet palate cleanser is offered between courses! I appreciated that touch. I can only add to the other positive reviews that our large group was served very attentively and that we all enjoyed our meal very much.

Pigalle,50,Great restaurant great staff,"This was our first time to Pigalle and we were extremely impressed. The welcome was very warm and friendly and all the staff went out of their way to make this a great experience. Warren who I believe is the restaurant manager went out of his way to speak to every table in the restaurant. Very impressed. The starters of Trinchado and beef carpaccio were excellent, the calamari tubes main course also fabulous, but the lobster thermidor was amazing. The wines were reasonably priced and the live music was excellent. We can't wait for our next trip to Cape Town so we can visit Pigalle again."

Pigalle,40,GREAT,"Went to a work function, Saturday night was very full. Food great, but had to ask if aircon was on. extremely hot inside which made it unpleasant. Band playing was excellent which made up for the heat. Bonus, wifi was strong"

Provence,50,Perfection!,"Bleu Provence is a charming French restaurant with excellent service and exquisite cuisine. Patio seating is private and comfortable. Early Bird or otherwise, you can't go wrong! Delicious craft cocktails! The beet salad was magnificent, whipped goat cheese and fresh herbed sauce, perfect for dipping the warm baguette. The Mediterranean Sea Bass, adorned with capers and fresh picked olives had an array of textures and flavors. The Waygu beef was tender and flavorful with a roquefort sauce and pomme frittes. Topped off the meal with a chocolate mousse and cream brule, magnificent! The coffee was rich and complimented the desserts perfectly. What a lovely evening! Thank you, John, our wonderful server, and his team!"

Provence,50,If You Adore Excellent French Food Then Bleu Provence is a Must,"Foodies...those that adore excellent French food...take note...Bleu Provence is the place to be. The food and the wine menu is mind-blowing. The service is excellent. Their mussels are to die for. I have always gotten my mussels with the traditional herb sauce...which is the only style my husband will eat. That said, I decided to change things up a bit and ordered by mussels with the blue cheese. OMG!!! They were amazing. Not overly cheesy...just perfectly balanced. And, for my birthday the chocolate mouse was a treat. Everything from the apps (get the salmon) to the champs to the dessert is excellent. If you want excellent then this is the place to be."

Provence,50,Surprisingly good.,This is a great french restaurant with a fantastic menu - lots of choice. Jim was our server and was very helpful. We a shor-trib stew which was fantastic and a Steak Tartare. Also started with a beet salad and Soup de Provence.  It was a good meal and the wines were very reasonably priced. We will go there again.

Provence,50,Better than we expected!,"We dined here about ten years ago and it was not good, but today we came and it was much better than we expected! The food was good, fresh baked bread, nice entrees, professional server, good desserts. I would recommend this French restaurant to anybody visiting Naples. I am really happy they improved themselves over this past decade!"

Provence,50,Best French in Naples,"Second weekend in a row. Just had to return. Ask for Snow, she will make your experience unforgettable. Short Ribs, Bronzino, Wagu Fillet are the plates we have had so far. We are foodies, and this place will keep you talking for days after going. Escargot, Foie gras and Mushroom soup are incredible. Scallops are very small but the awesome sauce can be used to dip the always fresh sour dough bread. Can’t forget to mention their incredible wine list. Can’t wait to return."

Provence,20,WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH BLUE PROVENCE?!,"Blue Provence has always been one of our favorite French restaurants. Then something happened. Maybe they got too comfortable with their popularity. Even their menu always seemed to be the same. I called to make a reservation for their Special Bastille Day Dinner that was advertised as being special. A young lady answerd the phone and didn't know anything about the special and couldn't give me any information on the menu etc... In fact, she was abrupt and rude! This is not the way to treat customers trying to make a reservation to an upscale French restaurant. After hanging up and mentioning this to my Husband, he said to call back and cancel which I did. Shortly, after that experience, we read that the restaurant was sold. It's questionable what will happen. A NAPLES FULL TIME RESIDENT"

Provence,50,A piece of France in Naples,A family run restaurant in old Naples by city docks. An outstanding wine selection and wine cellar where you can purchase bottles to take home with you one best selections of wines in Naples on menu in wine cellar.    Service up has always been outstanding owner wine connoisseur Jacque is always on the floor or his son the chef is Jacques wife a great chef of French food as the family is from southern France.    I’m not going to say what our favorite dishes at Bleu Provence are cause everything is outstanding from appetizers to desserts. House wines nothing more to be said excellent.    What ever your favorite French dish might be if it’s on the menu guarantee it will be prepared and served as if you where in France. It’s our understanding the owners are negotiating to sell after decades in Naples everyone retires sooner or later if this is so best to Jacque and family where ever they maybe going.

Provence,50,Wonderful dinner on the covered patio!,"We were here last night with two other couples, friends for many years. Most of us ordered from the special 5-6 pm three course menu, and I had the fish soup, followed by the loupe de mer and crème brûlée. All three were wonderful. There is an extensive wine list, but I had a Sancerre by the glass, and it was perfect. Our server, Andrea, was pleasant, professional, and attentive. The ambience is ideal. We are fortunate to have this place in Naples."

Provence,50,Really Great - no agenda 👏👏👏,"We are foodies from Ireland but have no agenda or affiliation with any other restaurant in the US or elsewhere in the world.    We have spent the last two weeks in Florida and this was by far and away the best meal we’ve had the pleasure of eating.    Not sure if other negative reviews have an agenda, but our experience- including our waiter from Albania (Alex..?) and his menu recommendations was / were first class; including the incredible tuna tartare - Merci Beacoups to all 👍👍👍👏👏👏"

Provence,20,Used to be my favorite...no longer,"Looked forward to celebrating my birthday on their beautiful patio garden. The ambiance is still wonderful but the food experience left us with a bad taste. We understand restaurants have raised their prices...$53 for a 7 oz Waygu Filet Mignon , but that minuscule serving looked more like 4oz and the accompaniments were tiny too.  At first bite, I thought it was liver and the au jus was very bland...kept adding salt. The halibut tasted good, not great, but again, was a very tiny serving and could barely find the risotto. The kicker was they said there was a complementary birthday ""plate"" and it was a scoop of vanilla ice cream over a few cookie crumbles. SeriouslY! Couldn't even offer the chocolate mousse? The wine and bread were good...but we will not be back."

Provence,50,Outstanding Naples French 🇫🇷 Restaurant,"This is one of the best restaurants in Naples. All of the food here is well prepared. For appitisers the porcini mushroom and chestnut veloute, handmade smoked salmon, bay scallops or cheese plate are excellent. For entrees the halibut or wagu New York strip steak (rare) are really good. The stand out is the wagu short ribs bourguignon which is outstanding. For dessert the vanilla bourbon creme brulee or chocolate mouse are delicious. Service here is professional. Bleu Provence has an elegant relaxed French ambiance."

Provence,40,Real French Food great atmosphere,"The food here is great, really the best we have had in Naples. authentic French food (we are Belgian/French living in Miami)only issue isit comes out too fast. within 10 min of ordering the starters are on the table and then once finished the main is already there. for us europeans and maybe more cosmopolitan than the average visitor to Naples thats too fast. but everything else is spot on"

Provence,30,Food remains outstanding - shame about the service,"On arrival at 6.15 the reception was not manned and we waited for too long before somebody in a disinterested manner took us to our table. The menu is excellent, the wine list one of the best I have seen. The service at the table was perfunctory at best. The food was outstanding but spoilt by not having wine when it was needed. In paying for the meal the server managed to lose one credit card return it without apology and mix up the credit card slips. The restaurant was busy but the main problem was the attitude of the server"

Provence,50,Restored and Still a Vibrant Experience,"We returned this season after Hurricane Ian, knowing that Bleu Provence had been swamped and gutted. And the reviews on TripAdvisor were terrible. So with trepidation we made our reservation and returned with the season.    And I am happy to report that the bad reviews did not constitute my experience. The physical plant is as attractive as ever. We were seated on the back patio. It was, as usual, much quieter than indoors (which can be very loud). The service was good. The food that all 3 of us had was excellently prepared and presented. The wine list, which is in my opinion, in the top few in the U.S. was still the same extensive (and expensive!) selection. Of course, the food prices were way high, but that's just part of the deal here.    If you want a high class dinner experience, Bleu Provence is still at the Naples high end."

Provence,50,My New Favorite,"I had dinner with my husband and absolutey loved it! Great atmosphere, amazing food and wine, and the icing on top of the cake was having Dana wait on us. He turned a wonderful dinner into an even more amazing experience. I will definitely be back, but only if we can sit at one of his tables again. Thank you Blue Provence, and thank you Dana."

Provence,50,50th Wedding Anniversary with dear friends,"Our actual 50th was Jan 20 and we looked forward to being in Naples for “season” so we invited 4 of our Naples friends to join us. Jim, our server, was outstanding, especially after bringing us the champagne we ordered, compliments of my brother and sister-in-law! Generous drinks, fabulous wine, delicious French food, blue/white French ambiance and courteous staff! Thank you Bleu Provence for a memorable evening!"

Provence,10,Worst food in Naples,"I was really looking forward to trying Bleu Provence, with all the positive reviews.  Went there last evening with three others. Attractive restaurant, especially the outside dining area. We were seated inside, and it was very noisy; very hard to hear the people at my table speak. The restaurant was full, and obviously understaffed. Despite that, our waiter was attentive.  The food was probably the worst I have had in Naples. The escargot were good, but not great; the halibut entree was dry and tasteless, the chilean sea bass was some sort of unidentifiable, unrecognizable fish cake, which was awful. Our waiter asked if I wanted something else, and i chose the branzino, which was only ok.  The creme brûlée was the worst I have ever had.  I apologize for such a negative review, but it was really that bad."

Provence,20,A Disappointment,"It had been quite some time since our last visit and we came with very good memories. The interior was a fresh blue and white decor and the staff did a great job recovering after Hurricane Ian.    Once we were seated at our table water came quickly. We sat for about ten minutes before seeing a waiter. After ordering cocktails, we sat for about another fifteen minutes to be served. Our waiter said the bar seemed to be in no hurry.    The menu was quite different than our last visit. Gone was my favorite dish but the waiter explained the veal dinner in a good fashion. I ordered both the veal and the burrata watermelon gazpacho. We enjoyed the bread for a long period of time before any food appeared.    The gazpacho looked very nice but there was little taste. The veal came with small pieces of meat, a few peas, a small onion, and a carrot with a few mushrooms. I did everything I could to eat it. The meat was fatty, the broth needed herbs or spices, and I found myself taking little bites that I did not enjoy.    The meal was expensive. That’s not anything we didn’t expect, but for the price the quality of the meal should have been much better.    I was extremely disappointed and have no desire to return."

Provence,30,Will not return and sorry we feel that way,"This is a vey highly rated restaurant and yes, the menu is French, the ambience is what one would hope for, the young ladies are welcoming and mentioned one of us has a birthday! Ok, I love escargot and there was plenty of French bread, it was fine, all entrees were ok not as good as Julia Child from my kitchen, but we are quite lovely people, well dressed etc. and felt the service was icy cold not to mention no birthday dessert for the bday boy. There are lots of good places to go in Naples, and I live here. For an average $100 plus per person? i won’t be going back."

Provence,10,Hero to Zero,"We have been eating at Bleu Provence for approximately 12 years and has always been our number one restaurant in Naples. Having owned several homes in the S of France, it always reminded us of genuine French cuisine. We recently went to celebrate our wedding anniversary and knowing that prices had increased everywhere, we were not expecting anything different than other restaurants.  However the portions were reduced with all of our meal. My wife and I ordered our usual grilled mussels and this worked out based on the portion at $2 a mussel.  We also ordered the same blanquette de veau. This was described as it should be with a creamy sauce. This is not what we got at all. It came with four or five scraggy bits of veal, a tiny slice of carrot, two slices of a tiny mushroom, two slices of one tiny potato and three thin asparagus. It was a disgrace and nothing like any blanquette I have ever had. It was also supposed to have peas according to the menu and there were none. An overall disaster. We mentioned all of this to our server who was very nice and surprised us with a chocolate mousse on the house. I wrote via thei website detailing our experience and never got a reply. I wrote a second time in order for them to have an opportunity to respond but no reply was forthcoming.  We will never go back again having been treated so poorly after being regular guests."

Provence,50,Family Dinner,Beautiful place Ivan our server is the best😊 Escargot is phenomenal short rib wagyu is really really Excellent!

Provence,50,Magnificent food and service,"The meal was outstanding. Beet salad to die for, veal in a sauce that was recommended by our waitress, and profiteroles. And speaking of our waitress, Lesley was amazing. she was available and checked in, but was never intrusive. The place was very busy, yet she never appeared to be the least bit rushed.    It was a lovely meal and we all agreed that we will return soon!"

Provence,50,Best birthday restaurant ever!,"We don't live nearby, but we have been there to celebrate my birthday three times in the last years. It's perfect! Bleu Provence is a beautiful restaurant that serves amazing, delicious French food. Last week, my snapper was so scrumptious, as were my husband's mussels. For dessert, you can't beat the Profiteroles -- not drowning in chocolate like most. The three course summer menu for $42 is an absolute steal -- unbelievable bargain, and the portion sizes did not seem smaller. In addition, my husband was thrilled to be able to buy some wine from their retail wine store at an excellent price while we were there. All in all, we can't wait to do it again."

Provence,10,Disappointing Birthday Dinner,"Four of us went to celebrate my birthday on March 11th. It was a Friday in Lent, so we all ordered sea bass. The portions were half the usual size; we estimate about three ounces. When we told our server, she said”Oh, it’s a new supplier.” So I wrote to Bleu Provence and never received an acknowledgment, let alone apology. We used to eat there several times per season. We find this nonchalant attitude unacceptable and caution others to speak to management loud and clear rather than pen a complaint."

Provence,50,Wonderful Bar,"Stopped by for an after-dinner drink at the bar. Wonderful. From Calvados to Side Cars, your beverage of choice will be served with a smile and professionalism. Can't wait to go back this winter with friends. The dining room is beautiful. The wine room unique to Naples, Southwest Florida and Florida. Enthusiastically recommended!"

Quatorze Bis,20,Not what it used to be,"Not worth the $, both in service and food quantity. Haven't been here in a while. Read so-so reviews but gave it a try. Maybe they were short staff or wanted to look from outside that the restaurant was busy, but they sat all groups very close together by front windows. Too loud, couldn't carry on conversation, couldn't hear waiter tell dinner specials all the while most of the restaurant 's tables were empty. Service was sloppy, not attentive. Belatedly checked in on table - so how do you like the food - well so far we had been served water after a wait and ask and repeatly told him not to pour sparkling water into glasses of those having still water - he wasn't joking as he really had no idea where each of his tables were at in the dining process. Wine list is larger if you want red. If you want white wine, it is what you can get at Costco. Good decent wines, nothing special. White wine deposited onto the middle of an already crowded table. Duck was overcooked, after asking that it be rare. Satsumas in sauce were a nice touch. Mushroom risotto is more accurately described as a vegetable risotto with a mushroom. Cod good. But all entrees were in $35-45 range with nothing else such as vegetable. Truffle fries were probably the only reasonably good and priced item we had. Dessert portions large, quality just okay. Waiter missed taking wine order, mixed up drinks, didn't bring a drink until 20 minutes later. A waitress came over at one point to help, she was much more aware of service."

Quatorze Bis,50,Perfect Place for Ladies Lunch,"This was my first visit and it didn’t disappoint. Walked in from valet parking in the back to a well lit room with floor to ceiling windows open to a beautiful day, with a view of people strolling down Main Street.    This was a ladies lunch for two. We each enjoyed a tasty salad with delicious proteins and zesty dressing. Service was excellent. The room was busy, yet the server was attentive.    Overall, a lovely experience. Reservations are suggested."

Quatorze Bis,40,"Terrible lighting, pricey food","Since Bobby Moore took over the menu prices have skyrocketed and the taste of the food hasn’t. It’s just fine but doesn’t seem to be worth the cost. In addition he has redecorated the restaurant in cool gray with very cold lighting. The bar tables went from dark and sexy to feeling like an upscale retirement home dining hall. The lighting designer should be shot. Going way back to when this premises was Fortnum’s it always had a warm and cozy feel. All gone now. The artwork is also uninteresting compared to what Joe had. I hope Bobby Moore makes it but I think I hear the pitter patter of little feet migrating over to Carmine’s where the atmosphere is still gorgeous, the food generally excellent and the sense of being at “Cheers” still exists."

Quatorze Bis,10,Horrible Resolution To A Small Issue!,"Let me start by saying the food, presentation and wait service has been good to excellent on our 1st and 2nd visits over the last two weeks. But we definitely need to address a totally unacceptable response to an issue we ran into last night. Just after our 1st visit on 12/30/22 we called to inquire about their Corkage Fee which was stated as $35. We then booked another res for 1/7/23 for us and another couple and bringing a nice 08 Cab to share with our guests. So the bill arrives with the ridiculous Corkage of $45 shown. I nicely asked our waiter to reduce the charge to $35 and advised my wife had specifically called in to check it just 2 weeks before AND at $45 we would have not brought our own wine as $35 was bad enough. So here comes in tandem the Ops Director Ms. Martin and Chef/Owner Mr. Moore to say bluntly its $45 and that's it. They couldn't have cared less my wife had called in and Mr. Moore blurted out ~""here's the deal, we make no money on people bringing their own wine"". They stood glaring at us in a demeaning way like how dare you to have questioned our policies? We paid our bill and left. So here are my closing comments on BIS On Main. We have spent over $640 on our two visits in recent weeks. You could have easily said ""okay, we will adjust this time but please be aware of the increase in the future"" and all would have been fine. Secondly, Mr. Moore should reconsider his very inappropriate comment about ""not making any money"". Are you serious! So as they say, It will be a cold day in hell........"

Quatorze Bis,30,They Don't Do Steaks Very Well,"First time here. I ordered night's special which was a ribeye steak. I ordered it medium rare. Most of the steak was rare. But the bigger issue, which is a cardinal sin for any chef that cooks steaks, the silver skin was not removed! Seriously, how can you cook a steak and NOT see that? The meal was nowhere close to being worth the $75 I paid for it."

Quatorze Bis,10,Ouch,"Dropped the biggest watery deuce of my life after eating the $30 eggs Benedict. So terrible. Prices are absolutely insane. I'm as white as white can be but absolutely felt racism the whole time, totally insane."

Quatorze Bis,40,Good place for a business lunch or romantic dinner,"Came here for a business lunch with one of our partner. I arrived at noon on a wed and restaurant was almost empty. However, by 12:30, it was almost full.  restaurant is centrally located in the old Bellevue area which is a nice area to walk around. Service was good albeit a bit slow toward the end due to so many customers. There is a good traditional restaurant atmosphere with table cloth on tables. food is freshly prepared. For instance their quiche takes twenty five minutes to be prepared and cooked. We were in hurry so i ordered the steak frites (flank steak) which was perfectly cooked and seared. Overall menu items are well priced in the $$$ range. The person i had lunch with came with his a week earlier to celebrate their anniversary and he had a great experience as well."

Quatorze Bis,30,Good food withlack of service,"Having not been to many restaurants recently it was my birthday and I remembered this restaurant as being warm and cozy with good cocktail and food. We valet the car and were seated ahead of our reservation time. For a group of 6 it was good to see they had held the table. The bar and restaurant were very busy. We ordered drinks and both cocktail glasses were chipped and one had lipstick stains. We sent them back but I suspect they just poured them in other glasses as the amount was much less. I had the scallops and they were very good as was the bisque. I had the veal and was not expecting the cut, but it was my fault. I couldn't really eat it as it was very raw. The service was slow and the waiter had no idea who had ordered what main etc. He was quite friendly though but very rushed. No mention of my birthday or birthday desert. Glasses of wine were quite expensive. No need to rush back there are plenty of other and newer options in Bellevue. This place relies on its locals and repeat customers."

Quatorze Bis,10,"Good food, poor service","I have to say that the food here is really good. However, the service is what I’m leaving the review about. I took my friend there to treat her to a nice birthday dinner. My friend is black, and I am white. Neither my friend nor I had been to Bis on Main before. We had a reservation, and in it I left a comment that it was a birthday dinner. None of the wait staff mentioned happy birthday or asked whose birthday it was, but that’s the least of the issues.    We had 2 waiters that night, one was training the other who was a new hire. Waiter 1 came, greeted, and began to explain the specials of the evening. I noticed that he only made eye contact with me, only spoke to me, didn’t acknowledge my friend. I noted it as odd and started to pay close attention. Waiter 2 came shortly after, made eye contact with me and asked me how I was doing, and managed to glance at my friend. Then a little later Waiter 1 came back to check on us and ask if we were ready to order, again he only made eye contact with me, and when it came time to take my friend’s order, he didn’t even look at her - he looked down at his note pad and asked what she wanted. At this point I fully realized what was happening. I asked my friend if she wanted to leave, but she said to stay.    Our salad was delivered to our table, and again - only making eye contact with me and only speaking to me - I was asked if either of us would like pepper on the salad. So I made the point to ask her if she would like some pepper. I was trying to give the hint that the staff needed to be treating her better. They didn’t take the hint. Throughout the whole evening they NEVER asked her a single question, and I kept asking her the questions first before giving my answer, because if I answered first, they would just walk away without getting hers. Towards the end of the evening it got to the point where, when I would get asked a question, I would gesture with my hands towards my friend to force the waiter to ask HER the question, THEN I would give my answer after she gave hers. They still never looked at her or acknowledged her without me forcing it.    When we were finished, I paid, tipped for the quality of the food, and then went up front to talk to the manager. I calmly explained what had happened, and he reacted in shock. He was very apologetic and said that the owner would be in the next morning, and that he would talk to the owner then. He also assured me that there would be a conversation with the wait staff that served us that evening. He took my name and email address as well. I told him we weren’t looking to get anything from him, but rather just wanted them to be better. Well it’s been a week since and I haven’t received any correspondence from the restaurant. No confirmation that there even was a conversation, no official apology or reassurance from the manager or the owner - nothing. Complete radio silence. Which is why I’m leaving this review, because it’s 2021 and NO ONE should EVER be made to feel unwelcome because of the color of their skin. This story deserves to be heard, especially since the restaurant has chosen to ignore it."

Quatorze Bis,40,Great for Surf and Turf,"We've ordered take-out twice from Bis on Main and have been impressed both times with their food.    New Year's Eve we ordered the Seabass and on Mother's Day my husband ordered the Filet Mignon - both were outstanding. Their Caesar's salad is also wonderful.    What brought the number of stars down to four was the chicken I ordered on Mother's day - not their best offering.    But we will definitely be ordering again, and now that we can eat indoors will try in-house dining as well."

Quatorze Bis,10,Sexual Harassment + Misogyny!,"I was at Bis On Main for a business meeting on a Friday evening. I was seated at a table in the bar.  It was early (5:30) and staff was gathered and chatting amongst each other behind the bar.  Despite the chilly temps, there was a man walking up Old Main with a Trump flag. They staff chuckled to each other in derogatory, foul language about the ""lunatic old man."" Certainly talking loud enough for me, a patron, to overhear. So unprofessional. They did not care who heard them talking.....  Soon thereafter, my associate arrived and we began our business meeting. When our server approached us, I was mid-sentence. I glanced down at the specialty cocktail menu, a tent card on the table.  I quickly ordered a Silk Teddy... some creative concoction with a pretty name. My associate ordered a riff on a Moscow Mule.  When our server returned a bit later with the cocktails, he placed mine in front of me. As he did so, he commented to me ""I bet you'd look great wearing a Silk Teddy.""  My associate + I were so jarred by his highly inappropriate comment that our conversation stopped for a moment.  Is this 1955? Hahaha no.... it is not.  We continued our meeting but I was insulted. We should have left right then.  On Sunday I spoke with Joe Vilardi, the owner of Bis On Main about my unfortunate experience on Friday.  During our phone conversation, Joe called me ""lady"" and said ""is this a shakedown?"" and ""what do you want??""  Nothing.... I was asking for absolutely nothing.  As a business owner, I thought Joe V would want to know about his employee's lewd + harassing behavior to me. All I wanted was an acknowledgment and an apology, or even a just kind response of ""I'm sorry you felt that way in my establishment.""  Joe V refused to say any such thing.  In fact, Joe V became defensive, responded to me with vitriol, and he then hung up on me.  Trickle down leadership.... it's a real thing, people!  It quickly became clear to me why the Bis On Main bar employees spoke how they did, and why the server spoke so inappropriately to me.  The owner / leader is fine with it.  He did not care.  Oh..... btw the food at Bis On Main??  The crab cakes + the scallops both had a strong fishy odor upon delivery to our table-- always a bad sign.  The polenta unattractively served, and is a flavorless pile of tasteless mushy grits.  Bis On Main is struggling.  BIG time.  Their menu is tired, old and boooooring.  SKIP BIS ON MAIN!  There are SO many other great local spots to choose from and support.  John Howie, Duke's + Andiamo's just to start....  All these spots have stand up leadership who proudly offer sincerity, principles and a fantastic experience, served up with no misogynistic behavior by the staff nor owner!"

Quatorze Bis,50,A Great Anniversary,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with Joe and the wonderful and professional staff at Bis on Main. Bis has been a restaurant we visit when we can and it never disappoints. For our anniversary my wife and I shared the house salad, unctuous with a savory buttermilk/bleu cheese dressing, while putting down the fork to occasionally enjoy Kushi oysters. Nice beginning.  For the entree`s my wife loved the Linguine with Prawns, a rather full plate, half of which is now in our fridge. Last night was he first time in my life I ordered the rack of lamb. oh, my! Three ribs came perfectly medium rare, accompanied by a rather spicy sauce supplied with a light touch. I cook lamb. But not like this. and Sal the chef de cuisine should be darn proud of this dish. Remarkable preparation.    yes, we had dessert, a Rhubarb crumble which was outstanding. I cannot recommend Bis enough.Greg our server was attentive and thoughtful, without hovering. The wines were reasonably priced with several approachable styles.    head on over, folks."

Raoul's,50,Delicious. Love the atmosphere.,"Sincerely, I have no idea where to begin. It's hard to put into words how great my four-course lunch at the Modern was, but the cuisine was excellent. Unquestionably, it was my best experience at this restaurant for excellent dining."

Raoul's,30,Not good enough at that price,We’ve been going to this restaurant for years on every trip to NY but this time we were very disappointed.  I ordered the seared foie gras at €36. My husband and I were going to share it and thank goodness we didn’t as you practically needed a magnifying glass to see it. A very small portion though it tasted good. My husband was happy with his oysters.  Then I had lobster risotto $56 which was claggy in texture and covered in Parmesan which should never be added to an Italian seafood dish. It was also very salty.  My husband ordered the dover sole at $76 as it is his favourite fish. He expected a whole fish but instead he got a pile of smaller fillets. Again not great.  The bill with 2 beers and one cocktail was $260.  We will not be rushing back although the place was full so presumably most customers are happy.

Raoul's,50,Go to Raoul’s!,"Definitely check out Raoul’s if you’re in SoHo. Our dinner was extremely enjoyable. Our waitress (didn’t catch her name she was blonde and had a really great sense of humor!) was awesome, she was super friendly and gave us great suggestions. You can’t go wrong eating here! We went on a Wednesday night, didn’t make reservations but we were able to snag a seat in their outdoor area which was a cool NY experience."

Raoul's,10,PASS,"Way too overpriced! Snobby attitude at the front; very dismissive. Food was just o.k. Tons of better French places in NYC. Would not recommend this place; would not go back! On top of that, the atmosphere is misogynistic. HARD PASS."

Raoul's,40,Institution,I love this place and I come every time I visit New York. It’s classic French with a New York vibe. It’s the grandmaster at this. I’ve had to dock it a mark this time for overcooking my steak. It’s only fair. Still love it.

Raoul's,40,"Great neighbourhood spot, even if their burger is sold out","I was staying in an Airbnb in SoHo and noticed most of the small restaurants in the area were on the west side of SoHo, with the chi-chi shops further east. There were more than a dozen dining spots in a 2 block radius of my apartment, and noticed Raoul's always had a line before its 5 pm opening. I would later discover the line was for its coveted burger, served only at the bar and apparently limited to 12 per day. I was unable to book a reservation here, but scored a spot at the bar long past the time when the burgers sold out.    The restaurant, like pretty much all in the area, is small and narrow. The pandemic afforded many places additional outdoor seating, which still remains. I noticed Spring St. is closed to traffic on weekends to allow for even more outdoor dining space on that street.    I had a daiquiri, the crab beignets, the steak au poivre and the banana bread pudding cake. Everything was very good to excellent, with the steak being my favourite. Service was good despite the crowds (2 seep at the bar). Didn't need to use the restroom since I was staying so close.    Great neighbourhood spot!"

Raoul's,50,Best steak au poivre of NYC,"I love everything about this place. The ambiance is very old New York, the cocktails are fab and the food is amazing. I always take the steak au poivre and it never disappointed me.  It’s my go to place in New York for a nice cosy dîner."

Raoul's,20,Very snobbish attitude,"The restaurant, which is touted a Soho culinary institute, has a very snobbish vibe. They treat their clients differently depending on wether or not your a celebrity. As for the food, it is good, but there are plenty of restaurants out there serving better French cuisine at a better price."

Raoul's,50,Always great,"Every time I go to Raoul’s I am reminded how much I love it. The last time I came we failed to get the Steak au Poivre and when I saw it pass us on the way to other tables. It is fantastic. The beet salad was awesome as well. The restaurant has a great vibe and service is always good. Chris, the maitre d’ always welcomes you with a big smile and manages the crowds masterfully."

Raoul's,50,Always Memorable Experience!,"Raoul’s has always been our go-to place for special nights or just wanting to have an overall memorable dining experience. It’s cozy atmosphere is complimented by artfully decorated walls. Cocktails are perfectly crafted and there is an extensive wine list. Every dish is a culinary delight and always leaves us scrapping any remaining morsels off of the plates as not wanting to waste a drop. Desserts are few in selection but so delicious that one must not pass up a proper ending to a wonderful meal. And if its a birthday, they present your birthday under a harden spun sugar “shroud” that is, itself, a unique treat to savor.    Although Raoul’s is small in size and seating, thus can be difficult securing a reservation, they don’t rush you at all to turn the table and let you enjoy a relaxing meal. Raoul’s is a truly unique and memorable dining experience that should be at the top of your NYC dining list!"

Raoul's,50,SoHo’s finest,"You can’t go wrong here. Classic French food combined with New York Vibe. Brilliant atmosphere. Great old school decor. Eclectic clientele. Brilliant music. Our waiter Javier was an absolute diamond, Hands down best meal we had in NY."

Raoul's,40,Steak au Poivre,"Best Steak au Poivre in town. I don’t order anything else when I’m here but if you happen to stop by for lunch, their burger is not bad, either. Service sucks but what can you do?"

Raoul's,50,The most delicious French food!,"My new fav French place in the city 😍    Nestled in the middle of West village, Raoul’s is an elegant and cute spot for delicious dinner!  Was totally full on a Thursday night, so make sure to make a reservation.    I must say, EVERYTHING WE TRIED WAS DELICIOUS! I am not easy to impress with food… but here I truly enjoyed every bite of food and sip of drink :)    For cocktails we had French 75 and Aperol Spritz (delicious!) - very refreshing and perfectly made.  We shared Crab beignets for appetizers (A MUST!) and had soft shell crab special and foie Gras for main course. YUMMY.    Wanted to skip dessert but everything was too good so we went for a banana-coconut pudding and it was also amazing!    This place is also knows for their burgers, but you can only get them for brunch or at the bar. Will have to come back :)    Naomi was our waitress and made our experience even better with excellent service she provided, accompanied with a warm smile on her face.    For more cool places in NYC and beyond, come say Hi on Insta @daria.newyork ❤️"

Raoul's,50,"Lovely food, lovely staff and great atmosphere",This place was amazing from start to finish. 3 out of 4 of us had steak and chips and it was out of this world.    It was $100 for a bottle of Whispering Angel but the restaurant is so nice that it doesn't matter.    Definitely a place to book way in advance but also somewhere I would say is an absolute must when visiting New York City.    They don't take bookings until a week before your planned dining date. Get in there quick as the times go really fast!!!

Raoul's,50,"Come for a special, timeless NYC meal","This place is perfect in every way and I was so thrilled to come back to Raoul's now that Covid is more controlled to find that absolutely nothing has changed. It is still the same incredible service, fantastic martinis, and energetic atmosphere."

Raoul's,50,"As Always, Perfect","The last time I ate here was with my wife who was 6 months pregnant with our daughter. So, 14 years later, I came back with our daughter as we were having a 5 night papa/daughter trip to NYC (her first time in the city). Raoul's didn't disappoint. The same excpetional service (Naomi was on point), the ambiance classic hip, the crowd a great mix and the food on point as usual. It was great to see the restaurant through my daughter's eyes. She appreciated all the details that make Raoul's special. The only down side was the back garden wasn't open so hopefully someday it will be an option as that walk through the kitchen is unique. We can't wait to come back and a big thank you for Raoul's for being Raoul's. Consistency over the years is something to really appreciate."

Raoul's,40,Gotta go once...,"You at least have to go once to Raoul's. The fries will bring you back again, as well as the quirkiness.....but brunch was just fine. Not certain we'd run back soon, but it's a well deserved staple in the Soho dining scene, and we enjoyed ourselves and the food."

Raoul's,50,"Olde New York; fun, hopping, wonderful food.","Small, intimate, dripping with atmosphere, simply wonderful food and service. We were looking for an olde New York type of place, none over the run with tourists normal lineials. Raoul’s s checks all the boxes. It’s simply a fun casual, non-pretentious place. Everything prepared very carefully, with great attention, never simply slapped on the plate.  If you want to be hip in the village, have a truly great meal and a wonderful atmosphere, this is for you."

Raoul's,50,Top if your List!,This is a must! French bistro in the village with a history dating back to the 70’s. I was there for brunch and Angus gave us 5 star ⭐️ service & hospitality. All while managing tue entire bar & mixing cocktails.

Raoul's,10,HORRIFIC NIGHTMARE,"I’ll start off by saying, having lived in New York for almost 10 yrs, I frequented Raoul’s many a time for drinks at the bar/dinner and had always had a great experience. At the beginning of the pandemic, I moved to Italy and when we came to Raoul’s last night, it was my first time back in NYC in almost 2 years, and the first time with my husband. We had a special weekend planned with my best friends who still live in the city and chose from the plethora of amazing options; Raoul’s for dinner on Saturday night. I made the reservation for 4 ppl at 9:45pm. My husband and I arrived and checked in with Chris, who I immediately recognized as the Maitre D whom I introduced to my husband and we chatted with him for a couple minutes when we checked in for our reservation (made on Resy) and told him how excited we were to be back and having dinner at one of my favorite old haunts. Chris was perfectly polite and asked us to grab a drink at the bar and that he would come get us when our table was ready (which is perfectly normal and expected, especially on a Saturday night). Our friends arrived and the important point to note is that we were all marked as “CHECKED-IN” for our dinner reservation. That said, it was a busy Saturday night, all the tables were filled and since we reserved a table indoors, I figured we may have a bit of a wait. No biggie, we get it, we’re patient. We’ll, 3-4 rounds of drinks in, and having seen Chris walk right past us several times I finally (trying not to be too pushy) asked him when our table would be ready. Without a second thought or hint of remorse, he just said blankly “kitchens closed, no table. We texted you” (which since I have an Italian #, I didn’t receive and had told them as much when I called to confirm the reservation earlier that day). Anyway, I hadn’t realized how late it was because we were having such fun catching up together at the bar but at this point it must have been 11:30pm. It had never even occurred to me to look at the time, I trusted that someone would get our very obvious party of 4 who literally had not left our perch at the corner of the bar since the moment we arrived. We were devastated, STARVING and had several drinks on an empty stomach and really NEEDED DINNER. And it would have been one thing, if Chris had offered a sincere apology and offered to at least take care of a round of drinks off our tab, but no. He just said “I’d offer to buy you another round but I guess you just want to eat something”. My husband who’s the sweetest most patient man in the world, was rightfully upset (as we all were) and just couldn’t believe what was happening. Instead of taking responsibility, Chris blamed us then told us that the hostess came looking for us several times and “couldn’t find us”. Just wanting to get out of there and find somewhere to eat ASAP, I politely asked if Chris could recommend anywhere with an open kitchen. He told us “try Blue Ribbon around the corner.” We paid the $300 bar tab, and quickly made our way over to Blue Ribbon. No tables available. We then hopped in a cab and went towards Tao (called them, also just closed their kitchen), desperately I asked the driver to take us to L’Express (another French place that’s fine and known for being open 24hr/7). ALSO CLOSED. We were entirely out of ANY POSSIBLE FOOD OPTIONS. Even room service at the Standard (hotel we were staying at) was closed. So yes, you guessed it. We canned to my girlfriends place in the UWS and ordered burgers and chicken tenders (crappy fast food) from the only place still open. Oh, and in the midst of all this, my girlfriend stopped her phone and cracked the screen (result of drinking on an empty stomach!). What I don’t get is how pompous and dismissive Chris was. THE LEAST THING HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS COMPED OUR BAR TAB. Clearly this guy feels he’s untouchable and is completely checked out of his job. It’s absolutely the worst experience we could have had. I also got a real vibe of male privilege from him and it’s just inexcusable what happened and that he didn’t lift a finger to make it right. Any maitre D worth their salt, would have comped our drinks and tried to use their clout to call and get us a table somewhere else. His treatment of us really makes me feel that we were being discriminated against, being an Asian/Italian mixed group. I know there’s been a lot of hate crimes in the city and I just can’t think of any other reason they “couldn’t locate us at the bar”. Give me a break. The bar is tiny. 4 people in a group are literally impossible to miss. Terrible ending to our otherwise great weekend in New York."

Raoul's,50,Always delightful,"Raoul’s continues to prosper and offer a culinary delightful experience. Chris the MaitreD’ is wonderful, the service attentive, friendly and professional (increasing fly uncommon in this post-COVID era) and the food delicious as always."

Raoul's,50,Great service,"I love this restaurant. I also want to give a shout out to Karine, who helped me deliver a gift card to family during the holidays."

Raoul's,50,Forever a Favorite!,"We have celebrated MANY occasions at Raouls over Many years… never disappointed! Consistent excellent service, great food & much fun… thanks for all the memories!"

Raoul's,50,Timeless New York,"You know how sometimes we overhype future experiences and they turn out to be underperforming once actually experienced? Well, this has not been the case.    Raoul’s is the essence of New York - the outdated yet timeless decoration, the vibrant atmosphere, the sleeplessness of conversations and the interesting multiculti crowd are all there.    The incessant chatter, the constant laughs and the very crowded spaces are what New York Saturday evenings should all be about, and this place certainly reminded you of that. It made you forget about work fuss, love drama, and whatever other stress you had been subject to the past week. There are a lot of conversation starters pinned everywhere throughout the place, so you may even choose to go there alone and see who it is that you will get to meet.    With regard to the food: I had an entrée of greens that was nothing out of the ordinary, a glass of house red and the steak. I may undoubtedly say that it is one of the best - if not the best - steak I have ever had. The waitress was charming and a joker; the sort of person you would befriend at a party or at a grill at your friend’s.    Prices are high, but you pay what you get. And this is always a good sign.    One simply cannot experience New York without going to Raoul’s. I even dare state - one will not experience New York without going to Raoul’s."

Raoul's,10,The WORST BURGER IN NYC,"was looking forward to having what we had heard that Raoul's had the ""best Burger in NYC"". It absolutely the worst burger I have ever had i my life and for $30 it was even more painful. The best way I can describe this burger is to take a handful OF WHOLE PEPPERCORNS, put them in your mouth and chew them and that is the exact flavor of this burger!!! Awful does not begin to describe it ! There were 4 people that I was dining with and we all had the same Peppercorn laced burger. In fact in the end my plate had some many Peppercorns on it, it looked like someone had sprinkled a handful on my plate. McDonalds is like Michelin star gourmet compared to this travesty of a Burger. Terrible, bad disgusting, describes the experience."

Raoul's,50,"If you’re in town, definitely","If you’re in town, definitely go grab a drink there and also dinner ... nice and vibrant atmosphere, cheerful staff, yummy food. We’ve tried the eggplant with labnah, beef filet, white fish, grilled carrots ... all were tasty ... a must try"

Raoul's,50,Waiting for Harry Potter confirmation,Outdoor and Indoor dining available; great customer service; excellent food; great neighborhood find the kind of place you want to dine with your friends or after a long hard day

Raoul's,50,Best of NYC,This is my favorite restaurant in NYC. I have been coming here since I was a kid and it’s still quintessential NYC with great food and friendly service. Nice to be back after 14 months. The steak tartare is to die for.

Raoul's,50,I’d definetly return here.,"I’d definetly return here. The food came quickly, it was good, and the people really friendly. I recommend the Eggs Norvegien"

Raoul's,40,Old school,"If the food and service were a notch better, this would be one of my favorite NYC restaurants. The feeling, vibe and style is quintessential New York. Love it"

Raoul's,50,Das Burger,"A friend has been telling me about the burgers here for years - they make a limited number every day, and you can eat them at the bar only. Suffice it to say it was the best burger I have ever had. Fairly simple concoction, but perfectly balanced tastes and textures, superb parts (meat, bun, toppings). Served with au poivre sauce on the side. Just amazing. Vesper martini was also superb. The only negative, IMO, is the frites, which were a little on the greasy side and kind of limp. A minor complaint, but in this case they are sort of half the meal, and not all that difficult to get right. Overall, though, terrific."

Raoul's,10,Chef refused to make a minimal change to an entree,"I took my wife on the restaurant we went for our first date.    When we tried to order, the cod was the only fish option left on the menu after they ran out of the other one (at 8pm? come on). Little choice then... and the chef when asked refused to make it without chorizo. Not wanting to speculate about their reasons, especially since they managed to block my first attempt at reviewing.    Factually though, I had a poor experience due to misplaced intransigence (they should have accommodated us as they ran out of the other fish). As a result, I wasn't able to have either of two entrees I wanted to order.    I had good memories of this place from fifteen years ago but am not planning on ever going back."

Raoul's,50,Delicious Italian,The atmosphere is wonderful and the food was simply delicious. It's old school Italian! I had the steak and fries - tender and flavorful!

Raoul's,50,Wonderful in every way 🥰,"This restaurant was recommended to us by friends who live in NYC. My husband & I had a delightful experience all around. The maitre de was so welcoming and friendly, our server was timely and attentive, food was excellent. I had steak and French fries and my husband had roasted chicken. Profiteroles for dessert. Could not have been better.    This restaurant is small and noisy with tables close together but it was so fun and like a neighborhood eatery. Just lovely experience. We understand it has been in business 45 years with very few changes. We will be back!"

Raoul's,50,Still one of the very Best !,"Great brunch and fantastic Raoul burger, salad at one of my favourite restaurants over 30 years. Perfect service from dedicated staff and I can not wait to be back soon again."

Raoul's,30,Rude York City,"The food is good, but that’s the cap of decency. The staff is incredibly rude & very quick to remind you of the next reservation behind you."

Raoul's,50,"Neat iconic, romantic, French Restaurant","You have to go at least once. It is an experience. The waitstaff is excellent, the food is well prepared, and it is VERY romantic. It is also tiny and loud. This feels like a small restaurant tucked away in a corner of Paris. Not for a regular meal, for something special like an anniversary"

Raoul's,50,Great Birthday Night!!,"Raoul's was perfect in every way. The atmosphere was great. Good looking crowd and a really unpressured night. The staff was really professional, knowledgeable and enjoyable. Will definately go back !!"

Raoul's,50,Classic french excellence,"This place is fantastic. Great atmosphere, great food, and a vibe that screams fun! Service is really good, the only thing they can improve on is timely reservations. Even if you have one, the wait is always at least 30 mins."

Raoul's,50,Classic steakhouse but French Style,classic place in SoHo. Don't miss the photo booth and the psychic reader. the steaks are great. How about the dessert?? Awesome. How about the location? Awesome.

Raoul's,50,An absolute must when in SOHO,"This cozy but very loud restaurant is home to perhaps the most outstanding Steak au Poivre I have ever had. The cut of meat was excellent, cooked to a perfect medium and crusted in just the right amount and consistency of pepper... served with a perfectly seasoned sauce of exactly the right consistency... and of course accompanied by a basket of crispy Frites! It doesn’t get much better than this! Exactly what I would expect from an Alsace heritage which, arguably produces the best chefs in all of Europe!"

Raoul's,50,Its a treat,Raouls is a traditional 44 year old restaurant in Soho. Its deliciuous. Go for the steak a la poivre

Raoul's,30,Burger Club meetup,"The NYC Burger Club met up here to continue our tasting tour of NYC’s finest burgers. We were excited to try the burger given all the media hype but sadly, the burger didn’t live up to its (perhaps overblown?) reputation. It was still a decent burger, but we just couldn’t figure out why it was considered at one point to be one of NYC’s best. Also we all remarked that on presentation, the burger is hidden by the greens, which was odd. The pork belly and dessert were good, but we came for the burgers."

Raoul's,40,Great food,"Loved the food, especially the Tuna. The place is super noisy, so if you want a quiet evening, this would not be a good place to go to. The tables are situated right next to each other, so do not choose this restaurant if you want privacy. We had a super small table for the five of us and the table could hardly hold all the wine and food we ordered, but as it was with close friends, it worked for us. I would go back if I could be guaranteed a bigger table."

Raoul's,50,Great Burger,"Even for $27, probably the best burger I’ve had EVER. Don’t wait too long. They only serve about a dozen per nite and you can only order from the bar. When we were in line when the resto opened at 5 pm, everyone in line was there for the burger. That says something."

Rue 57,20,Disappointing restaurant,"We’re here in New York for enjoyment. The concierge gave Rue. 57 as a suggestion for dinner, since we had been to an excellent Italian restaurant the night before. We were so disappointed. The menu was not what either of us expected void of French dishes. The service from our waiter was extremely poor due to him being so busy at the other tables. We had to ask for bread, which also was very disappointing. The shrimp cocktail was abundant and good, looking more like large prawns. The rest of the meal was average to say the least. Pasta was not homemade and the sauce was only adequate. The Caesar salad again just adequate, especially at the prices they were charging. I would not recommend this restaurant with all of the other fantastic restaurants available in NYC. Bon appétit."

Rue 57,10,Not the great place it once was,"So disappointing. Rue 57 was a staple for me in NYC and I was looking forward to revisting after living elsewhere for the last few years. It was just awful...with the exception of our server who was lovely. The bread had a funky taste like it was lathered in old oil or butter at some point. Not the crisp on the outside, soft in the middle french bread I remember. But bread is bread and not does not maketh the meal. It was the menu that was the biggest disappointment. Over the years it seems they've taken out a lot of the good french dishes they did so well just very basic tourist-pleasing fare. I expect it was necessary due to the pandemic and keeping their overhead low. The french fries were inedible due to the overuse of cooking oil."

Rue 57,40,"Nice lunch, great cross breeze in the summer","Fun relaxing lunch in the heat of summer. We had the mussels, omelette with a salad, ceasar salad, club sandwich & some glasses of the French burgundy & Aperol spritz. Followed by the apple tart. Nice place to stop for lunch. Great service & not rushed."

Rue 57,10,Extremely disgusting,Extremely disgusting experience when paying the bill. I was shouted and despised by the woman for giving less than expected tip

Rue 57,50,Twice in a week for delicious food.,"In town for a week and this was the only restaurant we visited twice. Professional staff, excellent menu. Well prepared delicious meals. They did have options for gluten free just a little limited."

Rue 57,30,"Good, just not Great!","While in NYC for my birthday weekend, we ate at Rue 57 for dinner. We arrived for dinner early (especially for NYC standards), @ 5pm. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, yet we were seated at a little table right by the stairs. Drinks were pricey, but not out of range for New York standards. The food itself was good. My husband got the chicken, which was a generous portion. I got the skirt steak, which was good (very thin and served with fries).  They don't do anything special for birthdays, fyi, just bring you the dessert menu.    All in all, it was a decent place to eat, just nothing to rave about. We wouldn't go out of our way to return."

Rue 57,30,Typical French Style brasserie,Typical French style brasserie in a great location. My Son had Steak Frites which was so very good. I had the Sirloin Burger which was tasteless. It was hot so we tried their homemade Lemonade which was great.

Rue 57,40,Caesar and Sea Bass,"Attentive waiter who gave us good descriptions of portion size, great tasting food. We weren’t real hungry so we split the two dishes and it was plenty."

Rue 57,10,Poor service,"We went to this restaurant for lunch, it was not busy, we were seated outside, we waited 15 minutes but nobody served us. We left."

Rue 57,50,"Great food, very nice service!","Had a wonderful dinner last night. The service was great, just like the food. We eat here everytime we visit NY, never a disapointment!"

Rue 57,50,The best cream of mushroom soup on the planet,We had a great snack today at Rue 57.  I had the cream of mushroom soup and it was spectacular. This was a special of the day. My wife had the shrimp cocktail. She loved it. It had four gigantic succulent shrimp.  Angela was our server and provided friendly and professional service.  The restaurant has beautiful hardwood French decor.  I would love to come back here for a full lunch or dinner one day. They do have Steak Fritas on the menu.  Enjoy!!!

Rue 57,30,Standards have slipped,"This was one of my favourite places for lunch in mid town when visiting NYC. Unfortunately standards have slipped, the menu is shorter and not as good, quality of fork has slipped and the decor looks tired and shabby."

Rue 57,50,"Lively Restaurant, Great Location, Wonderful Food!","Although we've been to New York many times, we've only had a chance to try this restaurant today. It was a great experience! The restaurant was bustling but the music was playing low so we could still have a nice conversation without having to shout. Highly recommend the French Dip and the Filet Mignon. Hope to try their deserts next time. And our server, Precious, was fantastic!! She was friendly and super efficient in meeting our needs (refilling drinks, etc.). Will definitely return."

Rue 57,50,"Wonderful Service, Atmosphere, Food","Wonderful experience at Rue 57. Atmosphere and food were top notch. Stephen was our server and he was personable, funny, and took great care of us. Highly recommend. Was a great choice before theatre."

Rue 57,10,Awful Waitress Experience,"Dined here with a group of friends. Our waitress was extremely rude and demanded a bigger tip. Came back over to the table looking for more money and was extremely cheeky to us! We were so stunned we could barely speak we thought it was a joke she was that rude! Food was nice, but the restaurant was let down by their rude waitress and her shocking service. I think this restaurant should have a word with their staff or start offering a wage rise if they are demanding more money from their customers! She’s lucky we haven’t took this further or named her."

Rue 57,40,Good brasserie feel for brunch,"7 of us meeting for a New Year’s eve brunch. Good service and lively atmosphere in this Brasserie venue on 57th Street. Good service, tasty food and lots of flexibility in adjusting certain items, but not others - in the New York way."

Rue 57,40,We had no reservation.....,"The host sat us with the condition we could be out in just over an hour.... I smiled and said: ""How fast can your kitchen serve us?"" He chuckled and showed us our table. :-)    Very nice place, good ambiance and the food was very good. We will definitely eat here again on our next trip to NYC."

Rue 57,50,Wonderful breakfast and fabulous service!,We were a large group of ladies who didn’t book for breakfast and by luck we found this lovely restaurant. The food was great and the waitress Precious was an absolute star i hope the owner values her as she is wasted serving tables.Nothing was to much trouble and despite her being busy she went above and beyond. We had an excellent time and i recommend it highly. The staff patiently waiting to clear tables were also very pleasant. Thank you to all concerned great coffee as well.

Rue 57,10,No croissants in a French bistro!!!!,So….we were getting ready for breakfast this morning and after being seated and waiting and waiting…..a waiter named Steven showed up and told me “I’ll be right back “ the rest is history….there was no croissants for breakfast and everything from service to bad attitude became a nightmare I’m this place

Rue 57,40,A safe card,"A late dinner when arriving to New York- Rue 57 is a very nice restaurant with good service and food. We had burgers, lovely tuna and fried aubergine. All very satisfied- nice taste. I’ve visited Rue 57 every time being in NY - always delivers!"

Rue 57,50,Rue57 saved the day,"After string of events that did not go as planned , we walked into a very welcoming staff . Joey , the manager made us feels so welcome. We had a wonderful waiter named Humberto, food was great and wine list was wonderful."

Seppi's,20,Ordering pizza,"It takes sometimes over 1 houer to het your pizza, The pizza is alright but The waiting time is crazy"

Seppi's,20,Relaxed service,"Had Käsespätzle, Pizza, Currywurst and Schnitzel. The service was partly great and flexible, but after following the service a bit, I would rather call it over relaxed.  The food is at the lower end of Alpine restaurants. The Käsespätzle was the worst I have tasted (served barely warm, jo texture, no taste), the curry sauce was a good try, but for sure did not meet my expectation. The pizza was ok. Will not return."

Seppi's,50,Amazing,"Amazing restaurant+ apres ski with super nice view the food is amazing, and the bar even better, everyone stops here after skien and is having the best time of there lives in seppi’s gerlos. Super friendly waiters. See you soon"

Seppi's,40,"Good lunch, went fast","This was decent food - good for a slope side restaurant, and the ordering system was very efficient. The view is absolutely spectacular"

Seppi's,40,Great place,Great place for apres ski and dancing. A dj plays great music. Often crowded but just go for it - they also serve delicious food which is delivered really fast. Open until the sun goes down

Seppi's,40,Good food and fast service,"The food at Seppi's is good, there is a nice outside area for when the sun is shining but inside there is enough space to sit comfortably as well. They have very nice coffees and the food service is very fast which is great when you stop there fore a quick ski-break."

Seppi's,30,Excellent food and atmosphere,"Stopped in for lunch. No space outside so sat indoors which was very comfortable. Food was excellent however only one dish arrived, we had to ask for the other order which came out later which was a little disappointing. Thought they might do the right thing on the bill, but it wasn't to be."

Seppi's,40,Skiing,"Really nice place to stop during your day skiing. We have a good meal, seat and rest. Nice atmosphere."

Seppi's,50,"Always a good time with great music, bar toppers and food","Thank you Verena, Hannes and Eva for your hospitality. I love to have my lunch and apre ski drink with you. FRiendly service with a smile, great dj's who keep the music going, lovely views and great food. Tthe lemon grass/basil pasta, the fish soup, the Green Biss and the Feinschmecker Salat are my favourites. Cheers"

Seppi's,40,Nice place for après ski and good food,We had some excellent mussels here at the piste with a nice Chardonnay. The lady behind the bar was very kind. In the afternoon you can enjoy the après ski with a nice beer and schnapps! They play nice techno music.

Seppi's,30,Great food - rude staff,"We visit very often when we come to Gerlos, but unfortunately the very last day of our stay the staff in the service-part in the restaurant was very rude to us!"

Seppi's,40,Great Apres-Ski,We were here for the apres-ski. We had nice weather so the umbrella was down and we could enjoy the sun! Great music! You still need to ski down after the apres-ski since it is on the mountain. We didnt had any food.

Seppi's,50,Great Place for Mountain Lunch,Great place for some food and a drink during a days skiing. Pizzas are really great and pricing is very reasonable.

Seppi's,50,Mountain apres,Great atmosphere on the upstairs deck late afternoon with a live DJ pumping out dance music (and usually some bold characters dancing on the tables in ski boots). Descent to Gerlos can be tricky after though!

Seppi's,50,Take a rest during a Skiing day!,"Good variety of Food, friendly waiters and cooks, a great place to take lunch on a Skiing day at Isskogel, easy to access and a wonderful view."

Seppi's,50,Great as always :),"Another year back here, and food great as always plus live music on the slope with breathtaking view. Great!"

Seppi's,40,Nice atmosphere,Nice place to relax and have a nice bucket of chicken. The whole were very positive. Tasted and looked good. No complaints at all.

Seppi's,50,Lunches,"What a beautiful place for lunch!!! Paradise. Incredible views, easily accessible on easy runs, and delicious food. We had the pizza and spaghetti bolognese - both delicious and big portions. We didn't want to leave"

Seppi's,20,"Popular bar/restaurant, loud music!","We only stopped here once for a snack (germknodel, yummy) and a cup of tea but left as quickly as possible as there was a dj outside, playing way too loud. The only tables available were the ones in the blast zone."

Seppi's,50,"Great place, food, and live music","We're coming back here for 4th year since 2013 and it's still one of the best places to have some rest and good food on the slope. Fantastic atmosphere, unbelievably huge viener schnitzel and tasty kaser spaetze are some of it's delicious served food. Best regards to polish kitchen's chef."

Seppi's,50,To start the apres ski....,"When skiing in Gerlos Seppi's is the place to start your apres ski. Very nice music by DJ and very fast waiters make this a nice place to drink a couple of drinks, but be aware you still have to make it to the village on ski or board ;)"

Seppi's,50,"the food in seppis is the best, but the music with DJ starting 3 oclock amazing","We love the food in Seppis, its really great we love sitting on the terrace when weather permits, and then in the afternoon, we love dancing on the tables in the large terrace outside, the Dj is the best."

Seppi's,40,Great for Après-ski,Great atmosphere with live music and DJ. View is amazing. Food (burger and pizza) and drinks are great. They supply standing heater which is wonderful unfortunately they can do better with the cable to avoid accident.  Overall I had a good experience and I will be back.

Seppi's,50,Great apres ski fun,"Great music with live DJ's, super friendly bar staff and a fun atmosphere. Seppi's is a must on the last run down to the village."

Seppi's,50,The best skihut at Isskogel.,"Great place to have lunch, or even better have a beer after riding while listening to Good music and chill in the sun."

Seppi's,30,Fine for one or two visits.,Good location but the food became a bit repetitive. Nice views and seating area outside. Kids Ski school eats here so it is ideal if you want to meet your kids for lunch.

Seppi's,50,perfect piste pitstop,"Open air pizzas, freshly made in front of you - huge spag bols and wienerschnitzel. Great atmosphere with live DJ on the piste overlooking the valley. In colder weather they put up the heated tent to stop you shivering!"

Seppi's,50,Best place in Gerlos!,"Great place to chill after a day of skiing. After 15:00 a DJ fills the terras with dance tunes. The food is good, but the pizza's are amazing!!"

Seppi's,50,"The atmosphere is great, the food is very good, the prices reasonable","First time we arrived the DJ was making everybody dance, drinks were pouring like water, the location was great. the next day we had lunch, which was really one of the best lunches we had in Gerlos during our ski vacations."

Seppi's,50,Nice athmosphere,"Good location for apre ski drinking and not only Drink is great, people are crazy (in the good sense) music is loud.....have fun!😜"

Seppi's,40,Good food,"Great food, good service and great music on the mountain! Seppi's burger is very good! Also the location is great near the downhill slope."

Seppi's,40,A beer with a view,"Nice place to have your lunch when skiing in Gerlos. Good quality austrian choice of food. If you find a place at the terrace, you might end up staying there enjoying the view instead of hitting the slopes....."

Seppi's,40,Good treat in the mountains,"This is a place were you will get very good food served with an extra touch. The joy starts with how the food is presented. Good seating areas outside and inside, both served and self service available.  Staff is a mixture of workhorses and bums. This also means that your experience can vary from day to day depending on whose in action. But, the food and location is worth the visit."

Steak Frites,30,Food was very good the service rude and very disinterested.,"We enjoyed the food, we brought our own wine, the atmosphere was great but the service was down right rude. Clearing the table before all had finished eating, came with inappropriate comments on choices of food and cooking of steaks. The waiter gave us the bill before we had finished our dessert and coffee."

Steak Frites,30,If you want to try it BRING YOUR WINE,"Was in front of the hotel, on a rainy day very convenient, but didn’t know I had to bring my wine, and was not a good surprise. And as I said, rainy day we decided to stay.  Food is good, fries all you can eat but what they serve is enough.  Asked for spinach as a side, they were out of them, so I asked for mushrooms that didn’t come in time, were good but not excellent.  We ate scallops (4 of them) and a filet mignon. As I said it’s good but not more than that….."

Steak Frites,40,Good steak restaurant,Good little restaurant focused on getting some core bits right - steak and frites! Bring your own wine helps to keep the bill down and friendly service from the staff in an easily accessible location

Steak Frites,50,"Bring your own wine, and great steaks.","This restaurant was near out hotel..  Was disappointed when we discovered they had no alcohol license but the food looked great on other diners plates so we stayed.  Fabulous tender , juicy steaks, cooked to perfection which is hard to find sometimes. Veg was great, frittes, l could take or leave but we went for steaks not frittes. Service very efficient. I noticed other reviewers commented on table cloths, cutlery etc. I couldnt fault here at all and class myself as well travelled.  Keep up the good work."

Steak Frites,30,The attraction is BYOB and bottom-less fries. No ambiance with cheap tables/seats.,"Our friends recommended this restaurant so we could bring our own booze (BYOB). We ordered the steak frites as it was the famous dish. Unfortunately I did not enjoy my steak, however there are many other things on the menu. They offer you bottom-less fries/free refills of fries. The furniture is cheap, we were seated at stackable/removable/collapsable chairs - I'm not sure if there are other areas in the restaurant with real furniture that is comfortable. It was cold as well (we had to keep our coats on), so unfortunately there was no ambiance/atmosphere for us during our time at the restaurant."

Steak Frites,10,Simply bad restaurant,Had terrible meal and terrible manager Steak Tartare was very bad. The owner was really rude It is a shame places are so poorly run

Steak Frites,50,Gorgeous steak,We went here for our final meal in Montreal at the end of a months travel in Canada.  We could not have wished for a better meal.  Steak and unlimited frites with pepper sauce. Hot bread rolls and whipped butter.  Bring your own alcohol.  Fab meal fab service

Steak Frites,40,Bring your own wine!!!,We came based on a recommendation but did not know that it was a bring your own. The waitress did let us know there was place not far that our gentlemen went to to purchase the wine we would consume with our steak. I had a filet mignon and my husband had a rib-eye steak. Cooked to perfection the way we wanted with all you can eat french fries. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and wiling to assist with anything we needed. Amazing decor. Washrooms where a little small. The ladies restroom was two stalls but one of them had a lowered ceiling. If you weren't careful you would hit your head. Our reservation where for 8pm and it quickly filled up. On a quiet street with not much to look at or traffic. Will be visiting again next time we are in Montreal.

Steak Frites,50,Delicious,"We could see this from our hotel, and dropped in just before ice hockey game. Steak frites was cooked to perfection. Poutine large portion but tasted great. You do need to bring your own alcohol. Servers were efficient and polite. Good choice."

Steak Frites,50,first time I came to a restaurant with twelve bottles of beer under my arm...not all for me!,"Food and service were great. I went for the steak frites...and it was spot on. The French ( well French Canadians) do steak really beautifully, I wish I knew how. They had told me that they serve no alcohol, so you can bring beer or wine as you wish and they even give you a nice little ice container to keep it cool. We enjoyed a nice meal and a few beers all in an unhurried atmosphere....I always go when I visit Montreal."

Steak Frites,50,What an awesome surprise,This restaurant was welcoming and delicious! Filet mignon was amazing as was salmon. The bread was to die for!! Bring your own wine because they do not sell it. No corkage fee. Not inexpensive but a wonderful dining experience.

Steak Frites,40,In search of good fries.,"We Googled the best French fries in Montreal. This place came up as number two, and it was closer to our hotel than #1 so we went for it. The fries disappointed us. They weren’t bad, but they weren’t notable either. Five Guys were better in my book. They didn’t seem hand cut, and they didn’t have that European flavor either that we were hoping to find in Montreal.  On a brighter note, our steaks were excellent. We both had the Flat Iron steaks. The vegetables were cooked properly, and the baby romaine lettuce used in the Caesar salad was excellent. We didn’t save room for dessert,  The service was friendly, quick and pleasant."

Steak Frites,50,Great Restaurant Downtown Montreal,"This restaurant was close to our hotel, so an easy walk. The flatiron steak was wonderful and you get all the French Fries you want. Take your own wine, they provide wine glasses. They don’t sell Spirits so take your own."

Steak Frites,40,Terrific meats,Price was great for what we had. I had the pork chop wife and friends all had steak. Wife steak was a poor cut. They took it back no issues and apologized. They don't serve any alcohol. But you can bring wine and beer. Really great service and food. Will come back when in Montreal.

Steak Frites,40,Well I liked it 😃,We were staying right across the street from here so ended up eating here 3 times  In less than a week. The steak is great :) plus endless fries and BYO wine- Awesome! Door staff could be a bit friendlier than “did you not bring wine!?”  Or “you didnt book? Good luck!!” However....

Steak Frites,30,It will do...,"We dropped in for dinner while in Old Montreal. I felt like Steak Frites - while the service was good the steak was just ok. It was cooked well but had no seasoning at all. My husband had the beef tartare and it was just ok. Overall service was good; it’s bring your own wine which is economical, but the food was just ok."

Steak Frites,30,Dinn with business friends,"Very good steaks and fries, as the name suggests, but there are other meals on offer. Bring your own bottle is no problem. Situated close to the business district and major office buildings IATA. ICAO and the underground city."

Steak Frites,40,Good food good service bring your own wine,I had the duck confit ($26) and my wife had the steak fries (28) came with some nicely cooked green beans and very nice fries all you can eat for thosevwith a big appetite My duck was nicely seasoned and not overcooked the steak sirloin at a guess was blue as ordered and quite tender there are a number of other options on the menu creme brulee for dessert was reasonably well made but the top was a bit over caramelized good coffee at the end service was prompt and professional

Steak Frites,40,The name fits,"Restaurant serves steak and unlimited fries. There were a few options for type of steak. All 4 of us ordered different kinds and all were very good. Perfectly cooked to order. Fries were delicious as were the steak sauces (peppercorn, mushroom or Dijonnaise) and especially the included vegetable assortment. It is bring your own wine. On the pricier side but if you are craving a steak dinner it isn't ridiculous and since you are bringing your own wine with no corkage fee it keeps price strictly to food ordered."

Tocqueville,50,Fine Dining at its Best!,"This is fine dining at its best! The food, service, and ambience all excellent! This is leisurely dining in a beautiful setting where you can actually have a conversation with the people at your table and be heard. We ordered from the prix fixe al la carte menu and loved the wild bluefin tuna sashimi, the poached white asparagus, poached maine lobster and, best of all, the smoked duck breast. The sake and wine also excellent."

Tocqueville,10,Extremely rude host,The blonde female host came over at the end of the meal and said the service charge we had paid wasn’t enough. We paid 12% service. I am not making this up. This is the rudest thing I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Disgusting behaviour

Tocqueville,50,Always a Perfect Meal,"Always a perfect meal. Food, service, wine list all top class. Everything we ate was excellent. Would return again and again."

Tocqueville,40,Fusion French-Jpanese food but very expensive,"If you have money to splash on experimental dishes, try this. They have the French favourites, but also Japanese ones, with some creative ones.  Overall, it's high quality dishes that really please the taste buds.  The hosts shows you the menu with the - very high - prices before you sit, so as to avoid unpleasant surprises."

Tocqueville,50,Total Elegance,"Cousins recommended Tocqueville, they are foodies, saying this is their favorite NYC restaurant. We were not disappointed! The restaurant is elegant, the service is beyond attentive. The menu looked fabulous, it was so hard to choose. The wine list extensive, we shared Prosecco. My husband enjoyed his salad, my soup was fabulous. His fillet mignon & potatoes was wonderful. I loved my lobster. We shared the soufflé's for dessert. I didn't want the evening to end, we have to come back!"

Tocqueville,50,AN OUTDOOR OASIS ON east 15 TH street,"REVIEW 15 EAST    We literally stumbled upon this fantastic Japanese restaurant that created such a beautiful outdoor dining experience. I noticed the pretty display of colors and beautiful décor from a distance and decided to make this establishment the home of our 35th anniversary celebration.  15 EAST did not disappoint. We started with the sashimi appetizer very delicate and refined, although a bit pricey. ($70) and then went on to have another appetizer a delicious pasta with uni. This was the perfect ending to a lovely dinner…so we thought. The servers graciously surprised us with a delicious anniversary dessert.  The servers, I believe one of them was named Miguel were on point, pleasant and were clearly eager to please!!! The hostess was very welcoming as well.  We will definitely be returning to this beautiful outdoor oasis!"

Tocqueville,50,Uber expensive and Uber Good.,Uber expensive and Uber Good. Business account place with a delicious menu. Appetizers were lovely and sushi was fine crafted and delicious. Fresh and lovely.

Tocqueville,20,"Poor customer service, lies and extras added to the check","Booked for a special Valentines meal some time in advance and was told would be a 5 course prix fixe, upon arrival in NYC checked and found was instead a 3 course prix fixe at €145 per head, ok fairly expensive but with the great reviews and high rating in the NY press decided would still go and see just how it compared to some of the other high end restaurants around the world we have visited    Upon arrival approx 30 mins early (did not want to chance NY traffic) we asked to have a drink at the bar and were told sorry it is very busy so we will have to seat you straight at your table, upon walking past the bar, guess what it was empty, not a person there but the restaurant fully occupied bar a few tables, one of which we were seated at, not a good start!    We were given our menus and then waited approx 20 mins before a waiter came to take our drinks order along with our food and then I received my cocktail whilst my wife waited another 5 minutes for her wine which came with the starters for us both.    The food was ok, not fantastic but overall ok but I will say my filet mignon was one of the best I have ever eaten so credit to the chef for that at least.    After desserts we noticed some guests being provided petit fours, however we along with maybe 2-3 other tables were not given any, there appeared to be no reason for one and not another receiving this so again very disappointing we missed out    Finally when we asked for the check I looked and saw that in addition to the prix fixe cost we had been charged another near $40 for our desserts, yes the 3rd course of the prix fixe so called the waiter who apologised for the error and promptly removed the extra charges but I wonder how many other unsuspecting guests had extra added without noticing    Overall a near $400 cost for two with just one cocktail and a half bottle of average quality wine was never worth the cost, combined with average service, nothing compared to other top quality restaurants and also the lies about the bar and overcharging I would say do not visit Tocqueville even with NYC inflated costs it is never worth the price and beware the check if you do decide to visit."

Tocqueville,40,Gem in the City,"Excellent food, very attentive and a nice setting. - Little mis-hap over the bill but that was rectified promptly. Only comment would be that the staff could be a little more friendly."

Tocqueville,50,We were recommended 15 East- not disappointed,"We were recommended 15 East by the concierge at the Mandarine Oriental what a great suggestion. Nice small but very clean restaurant. Very helpful and polite staff, great greeting. Black Cod, tuna tartare, Wagyu beef gyoza followed by Salmon, Sashimi (10) Tempura soda noodles then baked apple and ice cream - delightful!! The food was exceptional a real discovery."

Tocqueville,50,"Elegant Restaurant, Superior Service","We dined at Tocqueville on Christmas. Holiday prix fixes are always a bit of a crap shoot, but this one, after a stumble, turned out to be very good. After an amuse bouche and wonderfully crafted cocktails, we settled into our meal. I had a generous number of oysters. She had the beet salad with a warm, crispy goat cheese croquet that was delicious. For mains I had the scallops with foie gras. It seemed a bit skimpy at first, with only three scallops, but because the dish was so rich it turned out to be ample. My wife ordered the filet, which constituted the stumble. Ordered medium rare, it was impossible to cut with a steak knife and the single bite I tried was difficult to chew. How it ever made it onto a plate and out of the kitchen was mystifying. However, the server whisked it away quickly and substituted a delicious braised lamb shank, tendered with profuse apologies for the steak. Desserts were also excellent -- including a not-too-sweet sticky date pudding, and a delicate apple tart. The restaurant itself is understated and quite beautiful.  They take themselves and customer satisfaction very seriously, which is a relative rarity these days."

Tocqueville,50,Some of the best Sushi Ive ever had,"Out of this world. After a very expensive and disappointing experience at another Japanese place, this put order back into the universe. Every single piece of the omakamase was sublime, with standouts being the toro and sea urchin. The warm pieces were to die for and the rice was probably the best I've had ever. The sushiman was, according to my friend, THE proper guy. Fastastic."

Tocqueville,50,Always a Sure Bet,"I have been to this restaurant many times over its many years. Over those years the standard has been maintained. Service is excellent, as are many of the dishes. The seafood dishes are a standout -- Tuna tartare, lobster, black sea bass. The chicken was slightly overcooked, which was saved by the sauce. The chocolate soufflé and tart tatin were excellent. There is a very good wine list and the sommelier is quite helpful.    This is a beautiful restaurant, perfect for a special occasion or romantic dinner or an intimate dinner with friends."

Tocqueville,50,Great food wonderfully elegant!!!!,My husband was working on a project next door and we met for dinner there. The food was amazing as was the staff. As a native New Yorker I know Great food And superb customer service. This establishment delivers!!!!!Go there NOW!!!!!

Tocqueville,50,Superb Lower Fifth,"Tocqueville is quiet, elegant with terrific food. Excellent attentive service. We had duck and steak, as well as oysters and Foie Gras to start. All lovely. Very good Sancerre and Chianti to drink. A lovely experience."

Tocqueville,50,Intimate and Indulgent,"Toqueville is a beautiful restaurant with high ceilings provides a warm, comfortable, yet seamlessly elegant atmosphere. From the time I made my reservations, the staff delivered everything I had hoped for. This restaurant is for people who like fine dining coupled with other clients who speak in a hushed, respectful tone and are well dressed. The tasting menu is an unbelievable value for the dishes included on the menu. From the amuse bouches to the desserts, the presentation and quality are exceptional. Dishes included salmon tartare with roe and yuzu, lobster, filet mignon, sea bass with cilantro, passionfruit and rum granita, and chocolate souffle. Every dish on the tasting menu was refined and classic but with an innovative twist. Will definitely visit again!"

Tocqueville,40,Tocqueville Restaurant,"We have been coming to Tocqueville for many years, including before it moved to its (better) location at the corner of 5th ave &15th St. The ambience is now much better, quieter, and more pleasant. Tocqueville is one of the better, and now more gracious, French restaurants in the City. We tend to choose it for special occasions like Thanksgiving or Valentine's Day, when they have a special menu - though the food is excellent anytime you go there. The food (sole, veal, beef, lobster, cod) is about as good as anywhere in town - though a bit less fancy than Kreuther's or Daniel. So it's better than a 4-star place; a tiny bit less than a 5-star place - but there's no way to call it a 4.75 star place because there aren't that many circles they give you. The wine list concentrates mainly in excellent Burgundies and Bordeaux and the prices of the food and wines are reasonable and not exorbitant: it's fine dining that's a little kinder to your wallet. The tables are not close together, so it's a quiet restaurant and the service is quite prompt and good."

Tocqueville,40,Good Japanese Fine Dining On The Lower East Side of Manhattan,"Heard mixed reviews about 15 East Restaurant but was overall happy with the quality of food and service when I dined there with friends last month. Their raw food was better than their cooked dishes and their cod was the weakest. In fact, it tasted so fishy that we had to complain. The restaurant immediately took that off our bill which was really the proper thing to do. Otherwise, their tasting menu and their lobster and uni risotto were excellent! The ambiance was quiet and elegant and service was attentive. Prices were very high but I will still go back if I want Japanese fine dining in Lower Manhattan!"

Tocqueville,30,Disappointing for the price,"Given its price, the sushi was underwhelming. The servers knowledge was lacking customer the sushi chefs weren’t all Japanese, and the wine choices were bad, particularly by the glass. At $370 for a light dinner for two, I expected much more given the great sushi in NYC. Won’t return."

Tocqueville,20,Pretentious and Smug,"The wait staff, at least the one that served our table, set an uncomfortable tone for our visit. I'm not sure what the problem was, but our family group of seven all had the same reaction. He gave us the impression that we were perhaps a bit below the class of customers he was used to. Had the cuisine been overwhelming, we might have overlooked it. But the reaction of our group to the food was variable. Some liked it, others found it so, so. For example, I had a very interesting chicken dish complete with a ""chicken foie gras."" The presentation was outstanding, and the foie gras delicious. But, I could hardly cut the boneless chicken breast with the knife provided. It need a steak knife! Very disappointing on the whole, but the chef's complimentary appetizers and dessert sweets were excellent."

Tocqueville,50,Pricy But...,"Simply awesome from the food, atmosphere to the service. I had the cheddar salad and beef grilled filet mignon. Andrea had the lobster and soup. Their souffle dessert was to die for as well. Just a terrific dining experience. Yes it is pricey, but this should be a 5 star restaurant. It will never be confused with Taco Bell."

Tocqueville,50,Just perfect,"Everything about our evening at Tocqueville was perfect. We went to celebrate our mom’s special birthday and we could not have made a better choice. At many restaurants the appetizers and desserts outweigh the entrees. Not here. Each course was devine. The asparagus soup, Atlantic char tartare and mushroom risotto appetizers were amazing. And those appetizers just set the stage for the red snapper, smoked duck and wagyu steak. And then the desserts. The chocolate soufflé and citrus cheesecake ended a really perfect meal. The service was impeccable and friendly and went out of their way to accommodate the one gluten free allergy. We cannot wait to return. Tocqueville made our New York weekend so special."

Tocqueville,50,Suberb Japanese tasting menu,"While usually, if I am struggling to give a restaurant a full 5, I’ll default to a 4 since there’s no 4.5. With 15 East, my inclination is to give it the 5, since I feel it is closer to that than a 4.    We had the 6-course tasting menu, and were thrilled with every single dish, whether sushi, sashimi or otherwise. We paired the menu with a very knowledgeably recommended sake - the list being quite extensive and a challenge to navigate without some help from the sommelier (sake samurai?).    The service was professional, courteous, unhurried and completely non-intrusive. The atmosphere/decor is spare and comfortable without being spartan, though I felt a few splashes of color - some cherry blossoms, some simple Ikebana arrangements - would add some appeal and sophistication. The room is also quiet, tables are well spaced and intimate conversation is possible and enjoyable.    The price points make this, for us, a special-occasion restaurant. It was my wife’s birthday. We both felt the wallet-pinch, but could also not fault the pricing given the quality and the realities of what dinner “experiences” in major cities around the world will cost you.    Highly recommend."

Tocqueville,20,Overrated,"15 East is indeed a fashionable place, but far from the top sushi spots in NYC, especially when sitting at a table (counter was full) Tasting menus, sushi or sashimi, are disappointing and costly. Nothing remarkable here else than the tiny size of the portions served.  Many better sushi options in the Big Apple. Cannot find a single reason to visit this restaurant."

Triomphe,50,Generous and rustic pizzas in the heart of Paris,"Thick, cheesy cheesy and flavourful pizzas! I found Vesuvio to be oozing with generosity, with lovely, tourist friendly staff, and a great, appetising menu! Price wasn’t bad all things considered. Merci beaucoup!"

Triomphe,50,Great Italian food,The pasta was really good and the service was great. We were served very fast. Highly recommend if you are close to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysée

Triomphe,30,Lunch,Ordered beef cheese burger with fries and carbonara for lunch. Food were okay. Nice ambience. Business was quite good as I observed quite a number of work lunches in restaurant.

Triomphe,50,Absolutely great,"During Christmas period when Paris is over crowded we found this place and end up going there for lunch and dinner almost everyday. They are very respectfull for covid measures. The food is very good and the personel extremely polite and helpfull. We were a group of 7 including 3 children 16,16 and 11 years old and had a marvelous time each time we visited. We surely recomend this place."

Triomphe,30,"Good pizza, convenient location, hectic service, close tables",Stopped by since we could see it on a side street near Champs Elysee. Lasagne was good but not house made. Pepperoni pizza was with a nice chewy crust but could have used a bit more cheese. Only real complaint was that the seating was a bit tight with tables closer together than we are comfortable with and the servers were a bit frantic trying to keep the food coming out.

Triomphe,50,Amazing experience in Paris,"Amazing Italian cuisine in Paris with friendly staff especially Victorio, Toni and Adama, I recommend fried shrimps with calamari, green salad and four cheese ravioli"

Triomphe,10,Welcome so bad no professional For Italian restaurant 😡😡😡,No way no again so bad welcome !!!! u feel that you are not a client They speak between each other Italian they think we are not understanding them bad and never again 👎👎👎

Triomphe,50,"Great location, decent food!","Good quality and tasty Italian pizza, close to Champs-Elysees and speedy service. We tried the Picorini Risotto and was average, yet delicious. Recommended for a quick lunch while on the move in Paris."

Triomphe,50,Great pizza,"One of the greatest pizza in Paris. Few steps away fron the crowded Chaps Elysee, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. And the secrets for the taste of pizza is that is made by italians."

Triomphe,10,Unhappy,Had table booked at 3 o'clock today 5 December for a 21st brithday and been on phone to them 3 times in last 3days and i just had phone call off them at 13-20 telling me they are now closed for a week from 2day omg how unprofessional and very disappointed

Triomphe,20,So unprofessional,"Came here for lunch as we were in Paris for the weekend and wanted to eat somewhere along Champs-Élysées. Rude and unwelcoming waiting staff as well as average food, sent our spaghetti Bolognese back as it was so watery and they brought out another pair of spaghetti bolognese and it was still watery.    I think people only come here because of the location"

Triomphe,50,"Great pizza, even better Wine","Visited here after landing into Paris in the late afternoon. Our hotel was just behind the Champs Elysees, so we decided to have a wander for some food. Ran across Vesuvio, has a lovely atmosphere, nice decor and really great food and wine. Would recommend for a quick dinner in the evening after a day of shopping"

Triomphe,40,Pizza Vesuvio,"After visiting the Arc de Triomphe, we walked along Champs Élysées n decided to step into Pizza Vesuvio an Italian restaurant for dinner. We ordered carbonara, seafood pasta and chicken. The service and food were excellent. Must visit and try."

Triomphe,40,"Decent place, hit the spot","We were in Paris on November 9th for a concert (a-ha) and spent the day touring the city. We got off our hop on hop off bus (Found them on here, too - Big Bus Paris) at the Arc de Triomphe. We basically chose this place because it was close to there and we needed food quick and were looking for somewhere we wouldn't have a long wait. I did a quick search on here to see a few reviews and it seemed decent enough so we went in. We joked between us that it was funny we were in Paris and went to an Italian restaurant but there it was. I had a 4 cheese pizza with only 3 of the cheeses (I don't like gorganzola) and my husband had a burger. His bun came out a little well done/almost scorched looking but he said it tasted good. My pizza was really good. Really cheesy and I love cheese so it was definitely a win there and it had a pretty good crust. Service was adequate, nothing really special, the waiter was nice, not overly friendly but he got the job done."

Triomphe,30,"Average Italian restaurant,nothing more.","We have eat just one time at this nice looking restaurant which was full but staff was fast.We order pizza,but it is nothing special and spaghetti carbonara and it was just fine.The staff was very ""official"" and somehow unfriendly. The prices are high and inadequate for what they offer. But,the advantage of the restaurant is that it is in the center of Paris.Nothing more."

Triomphe,30,It's true what they say about tourists eating in tourist trap areas,"In researching places to eat in Paris and how to find a good restaurant, you will see time and time again NOT to eat at or near any of the major sights in Paris. Try telling that two two extremely hungry teenagers after a morning of walking all over Paris! We finally arrived at the avenue des Champs Elysees to see the Arc de Triomphe, but I wanted to wait to get further away to eat, but they were not having it. We chose Vesuvio because it was Pizza and easy to please picky teenagers. We were seated right away, and I saw on the menu that everything was quite pricy. But for three people, it was a fairly obvious choice to split a pizza. The waiter did seem a bit snobbish when we ordered the pizza and said we could not only order one thing to share; everyone had to order something. Fortunately, drinks did count - and well they should at 8 or 9 euros for a Coke (and slightly less for a San Pellegrino). The pizza was not bad, the crust was pretty decent, but it was a cheese pizza, so it's hard to mess up. It wasn't anything to write home about, and we left feeling somewhat like we'd received the ""stupid tourist"" treatment. But, after doing the research before we even got to Paris, we got exactly what we should have expected."

Triomphe,10,Terrible 2nd experience at Vesuvio,i visited last year and had a Pizza. It was terrible and the service was even worse. i decided not to go again. Today i was passing by with friends who were hungry and decided to go in again. this time i ordered quatro Fromagio Penne...  it was the worst ever. hardly any cheese in it. it was more like bachamel. my friends had 4 different types of pasta and was either terrible or hardly with any components.    can you imagine.. they only offer onion soup and minestrone soup... we ordered 4 minestrone soup and the waiter came back to say that they do not have...    the place offer terrible food and service and is very expensive. all their reviews are horrible.

Triomphe,50,A place to have a glass of wine in Paris,"I highly recommend this place, the attention is spectacular the host is so kind. In addition you can enjoy the night near of the Arc of Triomphe"

Triomphe,10,Rude Staff,"Went to this place New Years Eve, never met such a rude waiter who insisted i buy more from menu even though I just wanted a desert! Very, very rude staff and service would not go here again. I could brought his business outright and sacked him, rude n racist staff. Do not visit!!!"

Triomphe,10,"Waiter was rude, food mediocre, bathrooms filthy",As we arrived the waiter made a disparaging comment about Australians to his colleague in French. Not a great start but it was the only place with gluten free offerings. Waiter was less than enthusiastic and seemed as though he was actively trying to get us to dislike him. Food was mediocre at best but gluten free. My friend became ill very quickly after eating and went to the bathroom. In her words “if I wasn’t going to be sick before entering that bathroom I was afterwards.”

Triomphe,10,"Staff are rude and push, better food in asda","The staff there are rude and very forceful for buying food, stating that if you do not buy what they tell you to, you have to leave because there are other people that will eat it. Would’ve eaten elsewhere but we’d already waited for an hour to get the table, and all the other places had around an hours wait. The entire meal was overpriced for what it was, and could’ve probably got the same quality as from Asda make-your-own. Wouldn’t recommend, still waiting for the 32€ of food they forced us to buy."

Triomphe,40,Stopped in for an early dinner,"Stopped in for an early dinner and sat right at the window people watching.    We ordered a Charcuterie, mini pizza and spaghetti bolognese and they were all good. Paid about 61 euros. The wait staff were courteous.    Love the location. After our dinner we walked around Champs to work off our meal."

Triomphe,40,Trip to France in the spring,"The walk up the Champ Elysees from the Louvre seems to take forever, but there is lots to see along the way. Finally, we decided to stop for lunch at this pizza place. We got a small table right on the sidewalk, great for people watching. While sipping our wines we had soup (minestrone) and salads, & waited for our pizza - they brought the wrong one. No problems, no excuses, the server went right back to get the right order. It took a brief time to get it right, but the pizza was delicious - a four-cheese pizza that was so good. After lunch, we left to head to the Arc de Triomphe. This was a great stop on our way through the city of Paris."

Triomphe,10,Find someplace else,"Servers were rude and pompous and acted like it was a chore to serve us. We ordered sparkling water, which was delivered and opened with an exasperated sigh, but not poured into the glasses provided. Food was good,but service was worse than appalling. Unbelievable how they treat their customers. It appeared that the server made a concerted effort to be rude. Would never eat here again, and recommend you find someplace else too."

Triomphe,10,Dissapointing descriminative and disrepctful treatment. I cant give it a 0 otherwise it would be a 0.,"My friend and I were this weekend in Paris, so Saturday after a long journey we stopped by to have a pizza for my friend, Since I was sick I couldn't eat anything unless having a drink and take my medicaments, we ordered a pizza and drinks and then the waiter come and say "" we can't serve you for only one person, you both have to eat otherwise they couldn't serve us anything, so if you are Celiac, or having any Health trouble, they force you to eat otherwise go out. This touched me personally because this time I was sick from the food so I couldn't eat anything, but if this happened to one friend of mine that she has trouble eating in any restaurant and they have to throw her away from the restaurant I find that just DISRESPECTFUL AND NOT WORTH EVEN A PENY FROM ME NOR ANYONE.  I definitely wouldn't step not even one step and I would advise all my family, friends, that they normally go to this restaurant,"

Triomphe,40,An 8/10,Its our first night in Paris and we would like to try french food but we ended up on this restaurant. The service crews here are alert and civil.  We had the 25 euro three course dinner.  The foods taste normal.  Not a wow but not bad.

Triomphe,30,"Nice Service, Average Italian Food","For our first night in Paris, we wanted something quick and easy after a long two days of travel. We went to Champs-Elysees and went into the first restaurant we came across, which was Pizza Vesuvio. The service was quick and the waiter was to the point (not in a rude way), but we had a few laughs with him. We ordered the Onion Soup, the Bolognese, and the Chef's Pizza, all of which were sub-par. Overall, our meal was not memorable but it was an easy place to eat after a day of travel. It was not authentic Italian, much more American-ized to appeal to the tourist area of Champs Elysees."

Triomphe,40,Lunch on my last day in France,"Best Pizzas especially on Champs Elysee, very busy avenue. Grumpy and unfriendly waiter towards non French speaking guests, but overall, cozy atmosphere where you get entertained for free watching the visitors on Champs Elysees.. Great Pizza.."

Triomphe,40,Excellent Pizzas,"This place serves excellent pizzas. We were also greeted and welcomed by an energy filled lady with an extremely affable nature. The service is extremely fast. However, the only negative experience was one of the waiters who was extremely rude and snappy."

Triomphe,10,RUDE with a side of More RUDE,"Ugh, seriously rude staff. I was afraid they were going to spit in my food. I wish I could review the pizza but who cares about the food when the staff is so rude. You definitely get the impression that they don't want you there."

Triomphe,50,Best Pizza ever,"We stopped here simply because we were hungry and it was convenient. For me, i had the best pizza i've ever had in my life and my 21 old son had the biggest calzone that he had no hope of finishing."

Triomphe,10,Appalling Waiter,We ordered the two penne dishes with a tomato style sauce and when it came out it was with a cheese sauce. We told the waiter that it wasn’t what we asked for and he told us that the other was spicy and then walked away without us explaining that it was the one was wanted.    We just ate it as we had a show to get to and then when finished the waiter came to us and said “it was good huh?” We replied that it was definitely not what we ordered or wanted. Honestly it was cheese sauce on pasta - Mac and cheese like from a box. I could have very much made it at home.    I was disappointed at the service and notice through the time I was there that the particular waiter didn’t listen to a number of customers. The waiters need to slow down and pay attention to the ones they are serving at the time.    Disappointing!

Triomphe,50,The best food I ate in Paris!,"funny that Italian food was my best experience in the city, but it's true! great food, pasta brava! great service and i will definitely come back"

Triomphe,10,SAND in the mushroom Rissoto at PIZZA VESUVIO at Arch de Triumph PARIS,"I had dinner with my wife on 29th August 2019 at 7 pm in PIZZA VESUVIO, 144 Champ Elysees PARIS after visting Arch de Triumph, the food we ordered were 2 French Onion soup and 2 Mushroom Rissoto and a glass of wine . The Onion soup was really below average and substandard ,, with unbelievable amount of SAND in every spoonfull of Rissoto !!! after 4 spoonful we decided that it is not safe for us to consume food . We called the waiter and informed him that the Mushroom Rissoto was full of SAND( It is very clear that the SAND has either come from the UNCLEANED MUSHROOM OR UNCLEANED RICE) , He gave us a very indifferent look and produced a bill for 73 Euros which we paid and left to our disgust , I never ever had a similar experience in any part of the world not even in the developing countries . THIS IS A TESTIMONY OF THE UTTER NEGLIGENCE FROM THE FOOD HANDLERS IN THIS RESTAURANT, IN THE CITY OF PARIS, THE MUNICIPALITY OF PARIS SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS SO THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE REPEATED TO OTHER TOURISTS"

Triomphe,30,Pizza close to the Arc de Triomphe,"Tired and hungry after a long day visiting the sites of Paris and with the kids craving pizza we stumbled across the Vesuvio restaurant.  The staff are very friendly and attentive but the food was average.  The restaurant wasn’t very busy and service was extremely quick but one of the pizzas that we ordered was quite overcooked, the others were ok but far from the best that we have ever experienced. However, nothing too bad to complain about."

Triomphe,30,Just another pizza place,"For the prize of the pizza you would expect to be amazed but it was just a simple pizza , nothing special , mine was even burned a bit. The service was not bad , they just need to put a smile on their face. So in conclusion , not worth for what u pay"

Triomphe,30,Good but expensive. The boss needs to hire friendlier staff!,"Paris welcomed us with a day of sightseeing in continuous pouring rain. After drying off at our nearby hotel (see review on Hotel: L'etoile Saint Honore Champs Elysee), went in search of food for two hungry youngsters. The over-priced Brasseries along the Champs Elysee were a turn-off. Didn't want to venture too far as it was still raining. Found Vesuvio on a side street. At 8-9pm it was full of diners. With the exception of who I believe was the boss/manager, we found the two waiters who wore glasses, were unfriendly. I didn't eat as had a dreadful MacDonalds earlier for lunch. One youngster had a lovely creamy lasagne and the other had a soufflé styled pizza with ham and eggs inside. The latter was great but too much for one. Both dishes were €17! Far too expensive when the £ is so low (almost 1:1 ratio). The boss/manager took to my two youngsters and gave us all a lovely small ice-cream bar covered in chocolate. He needs to ensure his staff give off his vibe. it can be so off-putting being served by grumpy staff. One good thing is that Vesuvio do take-aways, so it is possible to order one to your hotel room, rather than Pizza Hut which our hotel suggested."

Triomphe,20,Tourist trap,Went based on TA reviews and wife wanted pizza. Food was below average. If Dominos Pizza would be a 10 theirs was a 5. Soggy crust and poor toppings. Four cheese penne pasta was bad. Still looking for four cheeses. Service quick but not cheap either! Avoid

Triomphe,20,Don't do gluten free pasta,"Totally overpriced gluten free pasta, which was so old it was hard at some ends. I took the pesto variation and it came soaked in oil, left my tummy upset for 2 days. It gets two stars because of the apparently not bad pizza my friend had."

Triomphe,30,Good Pizza,We stopped in after visiting the Arc de Triomphe. It had air conditioning so that was a plus because of the heatwave. The service was good and friendly. The food was average overall. I had spaghetti carbonara which was ok. My kids had pizza which was a better choice I think. I would go here again for pizza.

Triomphe,40,Pasta time,"You know when you’re in the middle of a tourist area Champs-Elysées and you are aware that restaurants around the area can be you worst mistake. We were a party of 6, we ordered pasta and they were great!!"

Triomphe,40,Good pizza and service,"After sightseeing for the afternoon, I stopped to relax and enjoy a pizza for dinner. The restaurant was almost full, but I was given a table along the wall. My salad was fresh and large and the pizza was well prepared, with a crisp crust, tangy sauce, and a good mix of toppings and cheese. Service was attentive despite the busy room. I would happily return for a meal."

Triomphe,40,Good,"A very nice restaurant, near the Arch de triumph. The service is great and so is the food. You can sit inside the air-conditioned restaurant or outside in the tent."

Triomphe,20,Overpriced basic Italian,Slow service to bring out drinks and food and the restaurant wasn’t even full. Food was nice but missing cheese and cracked pepper.

Triomphe,10,Vegan burger is NOT Vegan!,"The menu claims they serve a VEGAN steak, however it is made with CHEESE. I spoke to the waiter who tried to explain this by saying that “some people say they are vegan but drink milk, some people say they are vegan but eat fish”.  This is not acceptable as some people may order a vegan steak who are lactose intolerant - this not only shows a lack of respect to people’s dietary or religious choices but is also dangerous.  I instead ordered a vegetarian pizza without the cheese. They barely put any tomato on the base so I ended up with a pizza base with bland vegetables that didn’t taste fresh.  My girlfriend ordered a Margherita pizza which she said was average and tasted a bit like plastic."

Village,50,A must see!!,One of the most amazing experiences. The Indian village life has been beautifully captured. The food is authentic and the entertainment amazing

Village,30,One time go only but beware of scammers,"Overall good but bit on an expensive side. What really dips the experience are that there are some scammers inside like that magician who have free show signboard at a counter and says he will write what you wrote and explain what you wrote while he wears a blindfold for free at start then asks for money. What he is actually doing is he is wearing partial blindfold peeping between the nose and could not explain what was written, then got very rude asking at least a coin donation for gods who gives him power to do this, then threw that coin down to his assistant - what a bhent. What a scam. There are others also who upfront ask tip while it is clearly mentioned not to as they are already charging a good amount for entry. Food also so so."

Village,50,Royal thali,Good food Nice service Live music concert was awesome… Good experience with captain vikas… Traditional Rajasthani food

Village,40,Best place,My overall experienced was nice except food experience.. Food was not satisfactory... only traditional food was good

Village,50,Jaipur,It was s a fantastic trip in resort called chokhi daani exploring traditional Rajasthan culture one should visit when u r in Jaipur  Really enjoyed a must visit in Jaipur

Village,50,Royal thali,The food was authentic and the place has a very rustic traditional vibes to it with folk music playing in the background. The royal thali section has a seperate music section with hindi gazals and tabla echoing everywhere.

Village,50,Welcome to Rajasthan!!,This place is a must visit. Their welcome os really warm and also treat the visitors with courtesy...should definitely be in one's check list while visiting jaipur.....

Village,50,Excellent hospitality,Excellent hospitality at Royal thali Restaurant.  Lavish rajasthani meal in royal crockery. Mr Mahendra Singh was a great host. Loved the food and service with live music. Will love to come back soon.

Village,10,Would probably rate zero stars if I could.,"Not worth driving through the chaotic city, only to find the place flooded with people and us not finding a table even after confirming it with the restaurant 15 minutes prior. Over rated and Over priced."

Village,20,Bad service. Under staffed.,They oversell tickets now and don't have a proper sitting place for dinner. I visited this place after fews year and it felt like i was at a Indian wedding. The buffet was poorly managed.    And then we tried to move to the indoor ac restaurant it was overbooked. Then after waiting for 2 hours we finally sat down in the non ac restaurant.    The place where we were dining was not clean. We were sitting in leftovers from previous guests.

Village,50,Royal thali mr vikash,"Wonderful experience is how I would describe this - very authentic food, fantastic ambience and extremely courteous hosts and servers especially Vikash who served us for the entire stay. Would highly recommend if you’re looking to experience the culture and taste authentic food."

Village,10,Shameful place,Absolute shame on the management for food and water wastage. This place should be banned. this is not hospitality. This is absolute waste of useful resources.

Village,50,Royal thali mr vikash,This place is very good. Food is very very tasty. Excellent service specifically by Vikas. Great experience

Village,50,Royal thali mr vikash,"Great place with awesome hospitality😊and services...enjoyed food and Services ☺️☺️😊, must visit once"

Village,50,Royal thali Mr.vikash,Food is great service is very good nice arrangements with kawali inside that make your mood so good

Village,10,Terrible place . Wrongly hyped,Worst place . Waste of money . Everyone is asking for tip. Very dirty eating place .. very untidy . Terrible experience. Waste of time

Village,10,Worse place to visit in Jaipur,"I had the misfortune of visiting this traditional restaurant recently and it was a truly terrible experience. We visited the restaurant based on the recommendation of a few friends, but it was an absolute low light of the trip. The food was unrecognisable and inedible, even for children. The queues were excessively long and the lighting was so bad that I actually fell down. To make matters worse, the place was overcrowded and there was poor management. The staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. The food was also too spicy and unpleasant. The restaurant coordinator had offered to resolve the situation, but they never got back to me. All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

Village,10,over hyped place,"We added chokhi dhani in our must visit places while on jaipur trip reading all the good reviews but our experience was something different to start with it was weekend and it was crowded but still that was not the issue the guys at ticket counter was not responding to our any of the questions so we checked online and booked ticket online only on entering they have created village like setup which looks nice again the games and additional food items are chargeable INR 900 which is a basic fare is only for the thali which you get. We went to the golgappa counter not very crowded still the vendor was very rude to my surprise I heard him saying to the man standing before me please get down while the man tried to explain that he is trying to pay he said please get down and pay and count ""ese kitne hi khaye hai"" the tone was very rude. Golgappas were okayish but not complaining as it was INR 10 For 4 puris. Then comes dinner portion there are some 3-4 dinner halls but where ever we go they used to say it is over packed the waiting is there you please try the next hall however there were no one seating inside and very few people on waiting. Then comes the dinner part. Food is quite average. Malpua is a big no. Buttermilk was sour. Only good thing on the plate was aloo pyaz sabji, kadhi and dal. There are much better places which offers thalis better than this. So one can decide whether to go there or not. If we ignore the village setup which they have created there is nothing which is unique or memorable."

Village,10,Very bad experience not worth,Not good management and proper hygiene and messy all over and food dey dont serve again until unless u ask for 3 4 times and after long wait dey give u repeat any time dey lack in proper management

Village,50,Royal thali mr vikash gurjar,"I had an incredible experience at Chokhi Dhani! The Rajasthani cultural ambiance was captivating, and the food was delicious. The highlight was our waiter Vikas, who provided exceptional service with a warm smile, making the evening truly memorable. Will definitely be back for more!"

Village,30,Not great,"It just isn’t very good, the elephants, camels, cows and horses were very thin and extremely tired, how can you pay 20 rupees pp to ride an animal? That is inhumane. All the entertainment was lacklustre, the palm reading was so generic and fake, the dancers looked bored, the museum had no information just pots and a worker who walked alongside you the entire time. They say no tips everywhere but everyone is asking you for tips even the toilet attendants in the toilet that had mud all over the floor and a dirty nappy in the open bin. The henna was poorly done and everyone just looked like they did not want to be there. The only good part was the meal (we paid for the Royal Thali) however, they did not tell us what any of the food was or what was inside it and could not understand when I tried to explain about my allergies, insisting the food did not contain dairy even though it was butter and paneer? All in all I think it may have been good in the past but right now it’s very much overpriced for what it is."

Vong,50,A favorite for many decades,"I've been coming to this place with my parents since I was a little child, and I'm now in my 30s. It's our family tradition. We love this place, and it's been written about in the NYT    It's a very old house (typical for the Old Quarter), but the dining room is air conditioned. The stairs are tiny because Vietnamese people are small, but just go slowly!    There is only one dish. You eat by mixing the herbs in with the fish, and then in a small bowl you gather vermicelli, a few peanuts, a dollop of shrimp paste, a few pieces of fish and maybe one teaspoon of oil from the pan. Mix them all up, and you have yourself a delicious dish! The quality has stayed consistent for the last ~20+ years.    Yes, it is 'more expensive' than the other street food in Hanoi, but still it's maybe $8/serving, and you'd probably need 2. Seems cheap to me!"

Vong,10,Disappointed at all! Services,"Disappointed at all!  Services are bad, prices are terrible.  Special are Owner and Staff. They are so impolite.  Maybe they think they famous and good business and they don care services.  Hope they can keep their business on the future.  First time and last time. Too scary and disappointed.  Not recommend."

Vong,10,This is first time and last time,"This is first time and last i come here.  They are so impolite and rude.  Owner and staff like crazy.  We can not finish our food, so we asked them take away. But they throw our thing and our food box on the table with impolite face.  Their services is nothing."

Vong,40,Oily grill fish,"One dish only at VD170,000 per person, serve on a mini cooking plate with boiling oil, the dish is quite special but consider expensive base compare to local food, restaurant is on the second floor and need to walk up via narrow staircase"

Vong,10,Wow!,"Four of us, visited this restaurant on 12-14 Cha Ca St, Old Quarter.  Up the dinghy lit wooden stairs. Crowded scene. Serves only one type of food... = must be damn good?  Oh well, fish soaking in oil in a pan. Local greens on the side and bowl of rice noodles.  Cost VND170k per pax.  No words exchange. No eye contact. No service.  We watched how the locals ate them, and followed.  HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED."

Vong,10,Grilled Fish Rip-off!,"We will NEVER come back to this restaurant again!  The fish was mediocre and ordinary, it was swimming in butter and what was worse was we told them VERY CLEARLY that we only wanted ONE ORDER (140,000 dong) of the only item in their menu (we just had a banh mi snack 1 hr prior to dinner because the restaurant was still closed).    As mentioned, the signature & only dish was just okay, definitely NOT exceptional. AND THE BIG UNPLEASANT SURPRISE WAS OUR BILL WAS FOR 2 ORDERS! They insisted that the fish in the pan was for 2 ORDERS, but truly, the portions were so tiny that we would’ve been famished if we didn’t have the banh mi beforehand.    We have climbed other second-floor restaurants in Hanoi, but this one is definitely a hazard to old and young customers alike! The stairs were steep, the lights were dim the steps were barely enough for one’s shoes and the stairs were at a 25-degree angle- and barely 24 inches wide! I’m not exaggerating, but I was scared I would fall  and hurt myself!    So, with the awful climb upstairs and the mediocre fish, that’s the last time we will visit this restaurant! 😤😤😤👎👎👎    M DUNCAN"

Vong,10,not worth,"for an signatur dish this was very disappointing. the idea behind the dish is great but, for me as an chef, the reality looks very poor."

Vong,40,The original cha ca,"It is the original cha ca,located at no 14, cha ca street,the street name after the dish.but beware of another cha ca la vong,it used no 14 too,but different place.the original one dont use 14 cha ca as sign,so if you see the shop sign like 14 cha ca or something,then it is another one.anyway,the original one is not very luxury look,it is very normal place.so you may miss it.they sell one dish only,that is cha ca the grill fish.it is a traditional northern vietnam food,you hardly find it in the south.the price for one person is VND170,000,(cannot share),not cheap.the marinated fish in hot pan will arrive at the table, alongside a basket of think vermicelli, fresh herbs, roasted peanuts, chili.it may oily,but the taste is good,and the portion not big,so make it a bit expensive. service is nothing special to say,but ok,the staff or owner wont ignore you,due to language barrier,they dont speak much,instead,they will do everything for you,so order is not a problem.if you are the first time in Hanoi,this place still worth a visit,at least try once."

Vong,30,Tasty and interesting experience,"Full of locals which is always a good sign, the food was tasty and the novelty of cooking the fish and herbs yourself on a burner is fun.    However, this restaurant is really aimed at locals and takes tourists for a bit of a ride. Although not expensive by Western standards, it becomes very apparent that they’re charging you 3-4 times what they’re charging the locals for what felt like an overly small portion.    While it seems somewhat petty to complain over 6K VND (25 cents), they added this to the bill for wet wipes that they gave us without asking. Knowing that they’d already charged ya a lot more than locals this felt galling.    Finally, although the food came very quickly service was otherwise non existent - the English speaking member of staff did nothing to be proactive and only explained the meal and process after we had flagged him down and asked several times."

Vong,40,One of the best specialty in Hanoi but I like the food cooked by coal before,"I have spent my time for meal in this restaurant now and then. It is the oldest restaurant in Hanoi (more than 130 years old). In my humble opinion, I prefer the old style of this restaurant when they cooked the grilled fish by coal. Nowadays, they have used glue instead of coal for fire. It's more convenient than before; however, I figure that it is not enough heat for grilling first and onion. The price is not cheap."

Vong,40,"Not Fancy, not the best attention but its good","We've been in this restaurant several times and all the reviews you can read are true. The attention is not good, it is not fancy at all (the room where you eat is like a cantine but the Cha ca is much better than in other restaurants much better noted in tripadvisor. So yes, we like it"

Vong,10,Never ever coming back,Food is over rated. Expensive. Not value for money. Totally no service at all. We don't owe them a living. They forgot.

Vong,30,Expensive and just ok,"The fish was nice enough, but really nothing to get excited about. They were so busy, we felt quite ignored. It was confusing as westerners to establish exactly what we had purchased. For 3 people and 3 beers, over 750.000.a nice local experience but be prepared for the $$$"

Vong,10,Maybe a traditional restaurant but the place is a rip-off!,"My wife and me are just back from this place which we innocently tried out! We were astonished of no explanations or menu and only one dish served, which is a marinated fish with cold noodles and some fresh herbs. Really nothing special and as many say here say much too greasy. Ok, service was also very bad and we thought maybe no English knowledges. But when the bill came I nearly fell from the chair -170.000 per person! Only because the dish was famous 100 years ago. We eat in other places a rich and good seafood barbecue for 100.000!  Once we opened the door of our hotel room my wife started vomiting!  Please, never ever go there and make a big curve around this scam place."

Vong,50,delicious Cha Ca,"This is the oldest Cha Ca restaurant on Cha Ca street, and maybe Hanoi! It is a bit pricey at 150,000 but is well worth the money! The server cooks the catfish in turmeric and dill at your table! It is such a wonderful experience for all the senses!"

Vong,10,Overly priced for bad,"Only one dish in this restaurant and it cost 170,000VND per person! The portion was so small it can’t fill any stomach. And there’s a lot of locals there. We suspect local and tourist are priced differently! Horrible service as well. Avoid at all cost ! .. the taste and the price doesn’t match! The photo below is portion for 2."

Vong,40,Beware of decoy Cha Ca restaurant on same street!,"This is my first time writing a review but felt compelled to do so. I had wanted to try this famous restaurant which only serves one dish ""cha Ca"" - a fried tumeric marinated dish. It is so good that the restaurant only serves this one dish and nothing else! I tracked this down with google maps but it lead me to a restaurant pertaining to be this restaurant on the same street. It had brash signs and neon flashes proclaiming it to be number 1 for cha ca. we sat down and ordered only this dish, but it was awful. We left disappointed but was slightly suspicious that for a famous restaurant it was empty. We walked a few yards further and on the same street on the opposite side we stumbled on the original Cha Ca La Vong establised 1871 at number 14. It looked really inconspicuous and sure enough the only dish they served was Cha Ca. The difference was remarkable, the dish was fresh, had a distinctive flavour and was quite pleasant. The decoy restaurant had the audacity to charge more for this dish! Their business model is clearly to capitalise on the reputation from the other establishment as they blatant flash no 14 signs and stating they are 'no 1 for Cha ca' it doesnt even make any sense they use the number 14 when they are not at number 14! To tell the difference, the real restaurant has a stairway as you come in on the left leading up to the two floors of dining space whereas the decoy restaurant is one floor and have pictures of other dishes they served. The real restaurant only serves one dish!! We only tried the Cha Ca in both but the real one tasted so much better. No wonder the decoy which empty!! The audacity of the cowboys to charge a higher price for the Cha Ca. Also they cook the dish on an induction heater whereas the original use a gas burner. There are some disappointed reviews on this restaurant at number 14, clearly at the wrong restauant with induction heaters!! Oh well, i give them credit for their audacity but felt compelled to write this review as it is not right!"

Vong,20,Trading on its reputation,"Like many I came here on a food critics recommendation.it may once have been good but now it’s mostly indifferent.service is surly and unhelpful ( in huge contrast to almost everywhere else in Hanoi) surprise surprise the ‘free’ beer isn’t,and it was warm as well. Grilled fish isn’t,it is served in chunks in a ladleful of cheap oil in a pan with some raggedy dill stalks and a mound of rice noodles ( of course,noodles are cheap)and some indifferent sauces.i had to ask twice for chilli and limes (normal on all Vietnamese tables) and was distinctly unimpressed with the offering.ifyou’d nevereaten In Vietnam you might enjoy it,but when you have you will know it’s massively overpriced and not that great.significantly there were no Vietnamese eating there at all- why would they?step outside you can pay half the price,get cold beer and eat far better.please,do not give your hard earned money to this joint,there are plenty more places who work far harder and cook much better."

Vong,50,Delicious goodness,"Fresh herbs, great combination with fried fish, fish sauce, crunchy peanut, soft and delicious rice noodle!"

Vong,30,"Serves one dish. And it's good. Everything else is crummy in this old, rickety restaurant. Bad service. But i love it.","Serves one dish. And it's good. Everything else is crummy in this old, rickety restaurant. Bad service. But i love it."

Vong,10,Terrible,"I'd read so many recommendations about this place that I didn't check it out on TripAdvisor. What a mistake. Indifferent service, bland, dull overpriced food. Advertisement at the front offers free beer (which should have been a clue as to the quality) but we were charged for both ou warm beers and even when challenged. Please, don't go."

Vong,30,Old traditional house serving cha ca,"My favourite dish is cha ca and I heard lots about this century old shop, La Vong at 14 Cha Ca Street, i saw many other post of la cong and they are many fakes.    Though simple dish, but it's flavourful and I simple love it with noodles. There isn't service here since they only have a couple serving. Serving portion compared to others are smaller, lesser greenies.    Well at least I tried, I still prefer the one at duong thang. Give it a try if u happen to be near by and climb that super steep steps up to level 2. Distinct feature is that cyan blue wall!"

Vong,40,aka Cha Ca La Vong,"As at many specialty restaurants in Hanoi, they ONLY do ONE dish, and they do it well. No menus, just sauteed fish in turmeric, vermicelli noodles and herbs. Wait staff will confirm the number of diners, and then the food is delivered. Finish cooking at your table and devour. Good solid meal. Note the stairs to the second floor dining room are steep."

Vong,10,MOST TERRIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE EVER: bad fish and Food Poisioning,"NUMBER ONE GRILLED FISH at 14 Cha Ca Hanoi was the worst experience that i have ever experienced at any restaurant . We ordered the ""Grilled Fish"" which turned about to be fried, not grilled, greasy meat. The restaurant owners cheated us by charging high prices for Grilled Fish when they did not serve grilled fish. We got food poisoning from dining here. In the USA or Canada this restaurant would be most certainly shut down for health reasons. Going to this restaurant was the most terrible dining experience that I have ever experienced."

Vong,30,Once an iconic restaurant for Cha Ca,"Once 'the' place for Cha Ca, but I won't be visiting here again. Too many good Cha Ca restaurants with better food, quality, access and most of all, service."

Vong,10,Tourist trap!,"We visited this restaurant as it was the first to start Cha Ca, but boy were we disappointed. I went there with my boyfriend and wanted a light snack. The boss tried to push us to get the set for 2 which would come up to 400k for 2 person. I chose to go with the 100k for the fish and some fish cake (for 30k according to the menu). They delivered the 2 dishes, and pops both into the frying pan after pointing to the menu indicating what it was. What I didn’t realize was that each fish cake was 30k and he brought us 12 fish cakes! We didn’t finish it. Taste wise it was oily beyond believe! Price wise... be prepared to be fleeced! We paid 490k in total for absolutely rubbish."

Vong,10,Uninspiring and overpriced,"Supposed to be a complete gem, we had not looked on here, rather read guidebooks, and I can confirm it is as poor as others have said. It was more expensive than I have paid for any meal in Vietnam, small portion, uninspiring and yes the beer that looked to be ‘free’ wasn’t. As well as that it was warm! Can’t see any reason to come here at all folks"

Vong,10,Run away now,"Bad and rude service. Tasteless mulch of unidentifiable fish parts cooked by man picking nose and served with old limp bunch of herbs. Run now, don’t walk away - run."

Vong,10,"Tasty fish, terrible service","We went here since it was the first to develop Cha Ca. The servers were nasty, ignored us, never brought us our drinks or napkins. The waiter dropped a card on the table that said (we serve on dish—170VD). There are better places for Cha Ca and definitely places with nicer service."

Vong,10,Good taste and bad taste,"Good taste - still consistent in terms of taste, cucumin flavoured fish  Bad taste - overpriced - 170k VND for one person, no service, too little fish (if I really want to filled my dinner stomach I probably spend 1M VND)!    P.S. I went to the original one...they rely on their long history of reputation but this place is losing its shine, what a shame."

Vong,50,A favorite for many decades,"I've been coming to this place with my parents since I was a little child, and I'm now in my 30s. It's our family tradition. We love this place, and it's been written about in the NYT    It's a very old house (typical for the Old Quarter), but the dining room is air conditioned. The stairs are tiny because Vietnamese people are small, but just go slowly!    There is only one dish. You eat by mixing the herbs in with the fish, and then in a small bowl you gather vermicelli, a few peanuts, a dollop of shrimp paste, a few pieces of fish and maybe one teaspoon of oil from the pan.

Vong,10,ひどい客対応 Horrible Cust Service,"詳しい人におすすめしないよ、と言われても元祖ということで入ってみましたが、ガッカリを超える腹立たしい対応でした。 うちは魚のグリルを170kドンで出すだけだというカードを投げつけられ、ブンは切らずにどんと出される。ピーナッツを出してこない。ハーブは自分で入れろとまるで看守に命令されるように顎と箸で指示される。火の調整など一切なく野菜は焦げる。その上、後から来たグループ用の取り皿を僕のテーブルで仕分け始める。 たべてる最中に、コンロを下げる。という劣悪な対応にガンと文句を言って出てきた！ 文句をいう地元民も外国人はいないのであろうか？ ぺこぺこお辞儀をし始めたがこのふざけた対応に断固抗議した。    チャーカータンロンに行くべき！ 魚の量も不満なく、ブンはチョキチョキ切ってくれ、一皿目はよそってくれるので、わかりやすい。    Go Cha Ca Than Long, where better food and services are provided at competitive price.    This joint did nearly insulting service by directing me what to do by pointing their chin with no words. No bun cutting prior to cooking then they reluctantly cut the bun with a pair of scissors upon realizing that the bun was like a canon ball."

Vong,50,"one and only dish, and it is fantastic","read about the place. We went up the stairs, sat down, a card told us it was fixed price, we ordered a beer and enjoyed the best fish meal in Old Hanoi. Turmeric fish, with vermicelli and greens and cook it at your table. Loved it."

Vong,50,This place is more commonly known as Cha Ca La Vong,"And it’s the original. Housed in an old and original family home. Downstairs is the altar room and family room, up stairs (they’re steep, be careful) is the small communal dining room. Fish grilled right at your plate is the main item on the menu, and there are not many other items on the menu, yiunpointnat the picture on the menu,mit arrives as your table shortly after.mit’s yummy and worth the trip.    Tables are communal, mostly, but you can dine solo if you go off hours. Servers not really geared to English clientele ... they’re not surly, exactly, just focused on trying to execute their job with customers who they cannot understand."

Vong,10,tourist rip-off - overpriced and unpleasant experience,"we were tempted to try the grilled fish - which proved to be not good value for money, the serving for three would have been enough for only two, rather careless slammed on the table in front of us. taste was okay but nothing special. definitely not worth 200.000 dong!    the bad surprise came when we wanted to pay and found out that the ""free beer"" which was advertised to accompany the grilled fish was NOT included. we pointed out that it is fraud to use a blatant to lure customers in - the very unfriendly bully of owner could not have cared less and even shouted at us. the first time we were ripped off in such a manner after months of travelling in vietnam. :-(  NEVER AGAIN!!"

Vong,20,"Average food, terrible service","The food here is average, a lot of oil and not much fish. The service is whats killing this place, they completely ignore you and even charge for napkins... maybe just 1 star.."

Vong,20,avoid,"I don't need 100 characters to tell you my opinion of this place . 4 characters are enough : AVOID .  We were tempted to eat here by by a television ""Foudie"" show . Big mistake : Poor food , poor service , poor environment . Don't !!!"

Vong,40,Tasty - Historic - Way Overpriced,"To start with, this is an ""experience"" restaurant. It's not the most delicious or the best price. In fact, it's way overpriced!! I'd heard that the service was really poor but I didn't find it to be poor - just not friendly. So, if you're looking for a western-style meal with western-style service, this isn't the place for you. But, if you're looking to taste a part of Vietnamese history, experience a little culture and spend USD 7.30 (yup, that's still overpriced), stop on by.    Apparently, this is the oldest restaurant in Hanoi of this style - this grilled fish thing. It dates back to the French colonial days (which, frankly ended in the 1950s so it's not necessarily old in the scheme of Vietnam.) The legend goes that the restaurant owners sheltered Vietnamese nationalist freedom fighters who were fighting the French and therefore has an enduring bond with the current government and military.    Either way, you go through what feels like someone's living room up a tiny narrow and steep set of stairs to a rather unremarkable dining room. If you aren't Vietnamese, someone will put a little card on your table telling you that there is only one option and that the price is (currently) 170,000 VTD - drinks not included. If you continue to sit, they will just start putting things in front of you - without speaking. They bring out the fish which is already mostly cooked and then show you how to add vegetables and sort of finish the dish at your table. I thought it was very good but it really wasn't a lot of fish - mostly noodle - but that's local custom.    All in all, I found this to be an interesting experience."

Vong,10,Worst ever fish,"This restaurant was recommended from my Airbnb host quoted as ""must try before you die"" fish. Scammed!    You were told there's only one dish in the restaurant and I was thinking you better be a killing dish for this price. We were served with a pan full of boiling oil and the staff dump some pre-cook fish small fillet in with spring onion and dill. First the fish is small, second it is not fresh, third it was instantly over cooked under the fierceful fire under the pan.    The service was bad, room was very hot, and it is very expensive for what you get. Any one can cook a better fish than this."

Vong,30,First try ever,"The dish of fish is so savory and fresh; its taste is quite special maybe because of the herbs. My family and I have tried it for the very first time and we loved it. However, its price is too high and the service is quite bad :(  We hope it would be better in the next time if we could go back again :)"

Vong,50,The best fish ever!,"I haven't been a huge fan of fish since forever. I went on a 9 day trip to Vietnam alone, and I enjoyed every bit of it. My main aim is food, when I travel. Had all sorts of meats the first 8 days of my trip and did not touch fish. I did a lot of research and fund out that this dish must be tried. Not sure why but it just so happened that I saved this for the last day. I entered and saw mostly locals, which means it must be good, I thought. The owner served me herself because she saw I was alone. she explained the dish to me and slowly one by one plates/bowls started filing up my table! I thought to myself that oh man, thats alot of food for one person. Ideally the rice noodles and dill is shared, atleast for 2. But one is started I didn't stop.....the fish was perfectly cooked and flavors well balanced. All my bowls where EMPTY. Thats how good it was. Must try."

Vong,10,Tourist Trap,"Don't waste your time, energy and money checking out this restaurant (even though it's the original one). It is a scam! The serving was a very small portion of thin and tiny cut pieces of fish and some vegetables and noodles at 170,000 vnd per person. We left the restaurant hungry and determined to share our lousy experience with fellow travellers."

Vong,10,it is a scam,do not go to the store one with big yellow sign and big number 14. we got scamed at this one 400000 for 2people. very little fish. the owner （probably a gang member）strongly recommend us to order fish cake （30000 per piece）we said one but they give us 12 piece. we thought one piece might mean one dish. but it is not. when we ask for the bill they charged us 30000x12 plus 400000 whice is very over priced. we did not even finish the cake. we try to reason with the owner. finally they agreed to give us a cheapper price. when we got home we checked online. there is plenty of other scam in vietnam. strongly not recommend you to go to vietnam. very bad experience here.

Vong,20,Stay away!,"We went to this place on recommendation of our tour guide. My bad for not checking the reviews on TripAdvisor. The food is OK, nothing special IMO, they gave us one small pot with about 15 small pieces of fish for 3 person, noodles, some greens and small sauce plates. Might pass as an appetizer for 3. It came to 550k with a couple of beers. You can order double or triple portion if are hungry, but 170k each it will cost you."

Vong,10,Very BAAAAAAAAAAD!,This place was recommended to us on our hotel map. Just be very very careful Casie there is 2 places with the same name and the same number address! It is a massive scam as we clearly got the world place. They make you get a set menu thing for 2 but also get these fish cake things and nothing was great at all and then they charge something astronomical for Vietnamese pricing. It’s toatlly not worth it when you can get great cheap fresh food in every other restaurant! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!
